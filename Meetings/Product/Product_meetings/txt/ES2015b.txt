user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay . {vocalsound} Yeah . That's okay . That's okay . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Am I starting now ? Anytime ? Oh sorry . 'Kay , um . Alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . And um I hope you had a productive last thirty minutes . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Um , and um , I'll be taking minutes on this one , and um {disfmarker} Being hooked up to the PowerPoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for uh myself , because it'll be more about uh , what you guys are bringing to the meeting today . Um , so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is Poppy's presentation . And , um {disfmarker} So , sorry ? So , um , take it away Poppy . industrial designer: Okay . Um , do I need to {disfmarker} {gap} project manager: It's , it's plugged in . So , um {disfmarker} industrial designer: plugged in . user interface: F_ eight , w . Function F_ eight . industrial designer: F_ okay . Function F_ eight . Sorry about this guys . project manager: No problem . user interface: {gap} industrial designer: 'Kay . {gap} is on . Right . {gap} Okay . I will take this time just to apologise . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I , I only , uh , received my emails later on . 'Cause I was too busy carried away doing my own thing , marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: which is not obviously not a very good part of a team-working thing . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: But there we go . project manager: I'm sure it's fine . industrial designer: Um , so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do . And it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are . They don't need to actually manually touch the television set . So , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be . Um , from {disfmarker} Uh , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique . Um , one is the visibility in the dark , which was um Genevieve's idea . So we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically . And we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone , or um something fam familiar . A automatically , um lights up at first touch . Or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark . Um , also we could use um an alarm . So if we lost the um remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room . Maybe behind a cushion or somewhere . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Um , so that would work . Um , oop . Go back there . Um , another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . Um , from previous researches I've carried out on other projects , um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal . So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . So um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . So , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and I think that would be very important for products now . Especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs . 'Cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious . project manager: Right , um , one question . This , um , self-destructible uh metal , it allows for recycling materials ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So that , um , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ? industrial designer: Um {disfmarker} And then {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah they would , um you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . And that's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . I mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made . Um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . Something like the case , if it's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else . project manager: Mm-hmm . Would we be the company that would break down these , or uh metals ? Or would we contribute to another group ? industrial designer: You could {disfmarker} we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us . But it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . For a certain percentage at least . project manager: Alright . industrial designer: Not every , not a hundred percent of everything we produce , project manager: Okay . This sounds like a really great idea . industrial designer: but {disfmarker} project manager: One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: Um , so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: um 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive . You would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive . industrial designer: Well I {disfmarker} the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they don't need to be manually de um deconstructed . Like , you don't have to individually um unscrew all the screws . Because of this , their properties are smart material . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: All you need is just the heat , so they self-destruct themselves . project manager: Alright . We'll still have to investigate the financial implications . industrial designer: So I suppose it does need like high contact , yeah , you know high uh quality machinery , and very specific machinery , but {disfmarker} project manager: Alright . I like the environmental approach . Um , we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well . industrial designer: Yeah . Okay . Um also there is um components . This'll be how it uh will actually work . But I haven't put this plan together yet . project manager: I'm sorry , could you {disfmarker} industrial designer: There we go project manager: Those were um {disfmarker} industrial designer: . Sorry , should I go back . This would actually show the circuit diagram . Although I haven't come up with the final circuit yet . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: So I just {gap} put all those components in . project manager: So those are what , um , we'll c construct the remote . Those are all the {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . I it just shows what sort of energy source . It could be a battery , like rechargeable probably . Um , an' yeah , well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself . project manager: Alright . Great . industrial designer: Okay ? So , now is it F_ eight again to escape ? Or escape ? There we go . Okay . project manager: Alright . Thank you very much . And , um , the next presenter will be Tara . industrial designer: Thank you . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: There you go Tara . user interface: Thanks . Can you see ? marketing: Oh , {vocalsound} user interface: Do you think {disfmarker} Is it uh , function eight yeah ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Function F_ eight . marketing: {vocalsound} Function F_ eight . project manager: Function F_ eight . Sorry . industrial designer: The one at the top . user interface: Oh right . Okay . marketing: That looks right . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Okay . I'm the User {vocalsound} um User Interface Designer . Uh , the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have . Um , in this case it's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . By taking inspiration from other similar designs , we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international . There're two functional design options . A multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . And a single function remote control , used specifically for the television . {vocalsound} marketing: I'm sorry , what was that last one . Multifunctional and {disfmarker} user interface: Sorry . Um , a single function just for the television itself . marketing: Ch Oh , I see . user interface: Yeah . Um , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing . A single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices . marketing: 'Kay . user interface: Um , I think that a single function remote control would be preferable , because it's easier to use . It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable . Um , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . And less functions would have to be included . So it would be cheaper to make . And probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices . Does anyone have any questions ? {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} So as far as we know , um , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ? user interface: Well , it's just that , when we're creating it , we're , we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices . marketing: {gap} Right . user interface: And it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent , marketing: D_V_D_s and V_C_R_ ? user interface: yeah , project manager: Right . marketing: Okay . user interface: other entertainment devices . project manager: Does everyone agree with this ? Does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ? industrial designer: Um , {vocalsound} I was just wondering about the , what , what Genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . And that would probably , um , I d , well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . I suppose having that would complicate it a lot more . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} And limit the design {gap} . Do you think ? marketing: Yeah , I think I agree with the single design thing for now , because we're trying to do so much , that if we're trying to make a unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it's also multi also multifunctional , um , we're gonna go over budget for one thing . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . That's true . Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: So {disfmarker} project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: We'll have more money to go into the design side of it . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . Yeah . project manager: Alright . Sounds great . marketing: Mm , 'kay . project manager: Alright , well , um , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: are you ready for your presentation Genevieve ? marketing: Yes I am . project manager: Fabulous . Except you're not hooked up to the {disfmarker} marketing: Oh , user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: I'm not hooked up , but other than that , completely ready . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Great . marketing: Okay . Okay . Oh . I just lost my microphone . project manager: {gap} No problem , marketing: Just a moment . project manager: we can {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . So I'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . Um , and I'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly . Um , if you all remember from the email we got before our very first uh kick-off meeting , with the coffee machine ? The functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly . Um , so what I'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control . Um , so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled . Um , I've done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , um , and some internet research . And I'll show you my findings . Oh , and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose . So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products . Um , hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics . So I think that should be our priority here . Um , and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design . Not just in electronic fashion . So that it's something that fits in the household . project manager: I'm sorry , what was that last thing that you just said ? marketing: Um , we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , industrial designer: Mm . marketing: you know who's famous , what T_V_ shows are being watched , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: um , to influence our remote control . Okay , so the findings . Um , seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly . Which is a , quite a significant number . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Um , the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them , you know , neutral . Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . project manager: I'm sorry , that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . You mean that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control ? marketing: Yeah , they're willing , they're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality . project manager: Okay . marketing: As opposed to your basic , you know , oval black , all same size button remote control . industrial designer: Mm . Yeah . marketing: Um , so it is something that people care about . It's not , it's not ignored in the household . Um , seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot . Zapping meaning they go through channels a lot . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: They're you know thumb-masters . Um , and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . That A very small amount . Thought that was interesting . project manager: Alright , so it might be very appealing if , um , we have very concise buttons . industrial designer: Mm . {gap} the single function . project manager: And another thing with um lots of surfing , we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: because I find with um channel-changers that , um , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button . marketing: Yes . industrial designer: Yeah that's a good point . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: And actually to go with that , I'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used . And uh how important the uh users find them . So the power button , obviously , in an hour is only used once . Hopefully the person's not turning on and off the T_V_ . Um , but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten . So people wanna be able to turn on the T_V_ with the remote control . Um , as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set . Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: That's a huge amount . This is the most important button . Um , so obviously when commercials come on they're changing it , so as you said we want a durable button that's not gonna run down . Relevance of that button , our users found was uh ten , ten out of ten . Uh , ditto for volume selection , so ten out of ten . And it's used on average four times an hour . Not as much as channel selection , but still significant . Um , audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour . Relevance is two . Screen settings , which means brightness , colour etcetera , zero point five times an hour . Um , and relevance of one point five . We're getting to specific statistics here . Teletext , um , now I'm not too clear on what that is . I don't know if you can help me . Flipping pages . user interface: It's um {disfmarker} marketing: Is that {disfmarker} industrial designer: It's like the news . Or like information . user interface: It has {disfmarker} T_V_ has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: The {disfmarker} project manager: It's um {disfmarker} industrial designer: and what's on . marketing: So like a running banner , underneath {disfmarker} project manager: No it's a button that you press , and then you , uh , like a menu pops up . user interface: No , li Yeah . project manager: I haven't used it before user interface: Yeah . project manager: but {disfmarker} marketing: Oh . industrial designer: It's like {disfmarker} user interface: And you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it'll come up . industrial designer: It's like very basic internet . Sort of , marketing: Okay . user interface: Very basic internet , yeah . industrial designer: um {disfmarker} user interface: But you have {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . Like tells you the weather , and {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . But you have no interaction back with it , you know . marketing: Okay . user interface: Like the internet you can send emails and {disfmarker} You've no interaction . industrial designer: Yeah , it's just information that um , like television timetables , what's on , what's on now , what's on next , on every channel , and {disfmarker} marketing: Right . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Alright . Well I guess I'm not with it , because I wasn't {disfmarker} But it's , it's being used fourteen times an hour . Um , and has a r a high relevance of six point five . So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Um , channel settings . Zero point zero one times an hour . Relevance of three . Channel settings . user interface: Uh , probably just tuning in the channels , would it be ? marketing: P Sorry . Changing the channels ? user interface: Tuning them in at the very start . You know if you get a new T_V_ set , you tune in all the channels , industrial designer: To get the right reception and picture , I suppose . user interface: do you th do you think ? marketing: Oh , okay . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: Yeah . Okay . project manager: Mm . marketing: Um , so it's not used very often , but people still find it relevant . Okay . Um , biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed . Remote controls are often lost somewhere . So that was already discussed by Poppy . How we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it . Um , takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . industrial designer: {gap} marketing: So it should be very user-friendly , you know . People know what to do very quickly . Um , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . {vocalsound} {gap} industrial designer: Repetitive strain injury . user interface: Repeti Uh . marketing: Ah . industrial designer: I think . marketing: Is that what it is ? People with arthritis and such ? project manager: That's rather sad . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Um , maybe our industrial designer: Oh , I'm guessing that's what it is . I'm not {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , yeah . I think it is . marketing: designers can look into that . Um , buttons that don't require , you know , very firm pushing , if they respond . industrial designer: Mm . Yeah . marketing: But we'll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well . That's a problem . industrial designer: Yeah . It is . marketing: Okay . Did you guys uh get that one down ? industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yep . marketing: Um {vocalsound} okay , here's some ideas for you . A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . So I'll show you some numbers here . Um , so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five . Ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control . Um , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s Interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount . Um , that would , are willing to pay extra . So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . And if we have the budget for it . Um , if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off . Seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it . project manager: I agree with um {disfmarker} if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . Um , financially and and functionally . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Um , and especially if we are um trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that . industrial designer: Mm . project manager: Um , ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned . marketing: So that , that's a whole other field of research . I don't know if it'd be , if we'd still have a remote , or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Um and depending on how many members you have in households . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So it m it may be too complicated for us , but it's something to keep in mind anyway . project manager: Yeah . And something that might further complicate it is that the T_V_ makes noise itself . marketing: {vocalsound} Right . project manager: Wonder if it would have {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: And if there was conversation in the room at the same time , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: although in theory it doesn't tend to be when you're watching television , project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: but {vocalsound} {gap} could be very difficult to get the specific uh design . project manager: {gap} Yeah . If we're looking for a simplistic design , if {disfmarker} marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: We need to decide if that is our um intention is , is a simplistic design . industrial designer: Yeah . Mm . project manager: Um , because if , if it is then I think voice , um voice-activated {disfmarker} marketing: It looks like {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing , marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a , they won't be talking into a remote , I'm sure . marketing: It'd be like the ultimate remote . {gap} Um {vocalsound} okay . And th the last thing here was a , an L_C_D_ screen . So , I mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us . Not practical . Um an L_C_D_ screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So that you don't have so many buttons to deal with . project manager: Um , I don't know what an L_C_D_ screen is . marketing: Oh sorry , just , just a screen , like a computer screen . S Or like um {disfmarker} user interface: Mobile phone . industrial designer: Mm . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . Or {disfmarker} Like an alarm clock . You'd have an L_C_D_ versus just a , a normal clock . industrial designer: What , what would appear on the screen ? project manager: I have no idea still . {vocalsound} I'm sorry . {vocalsound} marketing: Oh just like an electronic screen . As opposed to just buttons . There would be like a little , like on {disfmarker} project manager: Oh , on the remote . Okay . marketing: Yeah . Like on the top of a cellphone , the the little L_C_D_ screen . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Um , now that's , I , I dunno exactly what exactly we'd put on there . I guess the channel that you're on , the v the volume setting . user interface: Yeah . Could it it {disfmarker} It would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next . But that would probably be {disfmarker} industrial designer: Like linked in with the teletext , user interface: Yeah . That would be good , yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: or sort of like an teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television . user interface: Yeah . Might be quite expensive to do that though . industrial designer: Mm , Yeah . Could be . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Well I guess that's something we can all take back to our respective research . project manager: Right . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: Um , and finally , whoops , my personal preferences and thoughts . Um , I think our priority really should be unique design . Um , we want something that people want in their home . Every remote control looks the same , so uh in my opinion it should be , um , user-friendly and unique . So the other stuff might be a little too , a little too gadgety for some people . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Um , I th myself , voice recognition kind of scares me off . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: So if we're , if we're aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Um , and for all , the other thing is like age market . I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff . But if we wanna make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe stick to the basics . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control . Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they're just starting out marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: and , yeah . marketing: Right . And we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research . I mean , you know , a sixteen year old boy would say , yeah I'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that's three months allowance . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Um , so I I think , I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more . user interface: Early twenties , that's the kind of age group . project manager: Yeah . And if one of the largest , uh , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control , user interface: Twenties . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: I'm sure that something like an L_C_D_ screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem . industrial designer: Yeah . Complicated jus complicating things even fo Mm . marketing: Yep . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Alright . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Okay . That's it for the market research . project manager: Okay . Before we go into uh more discussion on {gap} we want this design to look like , I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions . Um , for one thing , because {disfmarker} Having controls with D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control . Um , we've decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television um function . Which is good as , as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway . Um , for many reasons . So um we have that decision sort of made for us . Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . And so uh we won't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option . industrial designer: Can I just interrupt ? project manager: Yep . industrial designer: Would you like to plug in your {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . Maybe we can do the {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , sure . industrial designer: Have you got a PowerPoint or not ? project manager: Yeah I do . I'm looking at {disfmarker} looking at it right now . industrial designer: Okay . Thanks . marketing: There you go . project manager: {gap} thank you . marketing: Oh , come back screen . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Hmm . {gap} industrial designer: Were they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ? project manager: Um , well , I mean we don't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control , industrial designer: {gap} Yeah . Yeah . project manager: but um they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used . industrial designer: Okay . Yeah . Okay . project manager: Alright , and another thing . This is for the design , the design of the product is that um we wanna create , um more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . So , um , all the remote controls must have our um {disfmarker} We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way . industrial designer: Right . Yeah . project manager: So , um , perhaps um our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good . industrial designer: Yeah . Okay . project manager: Um , it doesn't have to be the colour of our um of our company industrial designer: Just {disfmarker} project manager: but , another thing is that , um industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon . Um , I'm assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting I , I wasn't offered a , like a type of logo or colour , so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable . industrial designer: Okay . Work on that . marketing: It's probably R_ R_R_ in yellow . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: The little R_ R_ yellow thing ? Okay . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , I think . project manager: Real Reaction ? Okay . Um , yes , those are the changes . Um , so , now we need to discuss , um and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be . I'm just going to look at my notes for a second . Um , we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control . So , um , we already know that it'll just be for the television . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: It'll {disfmarker} It won't have teletext . But um , you know , we could discuss um those other options that you brought up , Genevieve . industrial designer: {gap} marketing: Okay , so I {disfmarker} Are we going to write off the L_C_D_ option ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Is that how most people feel about that ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay . marketing: Okay . So no L_C_D_ , no teletext , and no voice recognition . user interface: I think it would be annoying though if {disfmarker} I don't use teletext that much , but if it was on your T_V_ , you'd want to be able to use it , if {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd , um , I know for one that in North America there is no such thing as teletext , so it'd be really superfluous . user interface: You'd {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: So is it just {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Never heard of it . user interface: Okay . Alright . project manager: Yeah . I don't know about other countries besides the U_K_ . user interface: Right . project manager: Do you know if anywhere else has it ? industrial designer: I don't know . user interface: I don't know . industrial designer: More research required , I think . user interface: I don't know . {vocalsound} project manager: Alright . industrial designer: {vocalsound} But if {disfmarker} Was it a management decision that we're having {disfmarker} project manager: It was a management decision , industrial designer: Okay . project manager: so it's , it's pretty much out of our hands at this point . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Okay then . project manager: 'Kay . So , I guess we're looking at something rather simple . marketing: Um , well I guess , just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons . industrial designer: 'Kay . marketing: Um . industrial designer: Minimal {disfmarker} marketing: And the {disfmarker} What was the word they used ? F findability is important . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had . industrial designer: Yeah okay . marketing: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . project manager: 'Cause I'm sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . The same signalling . project manager: the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise . industrial designer: I mean {disfmarker} project manager: It's not that expensive to do . industrial designer: Or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone . Like you just a , a buzz or something . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . Okay . I like that idea . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Would you be able to , um , put the little device anywhere ? {vocalsound} 'Cause uh isn't our remote control for all T_V_s , so industrial designer: If {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: you'd ha industrial designer: Do you mean the the link between the {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , with the button that you pressed . project manager: Yeah . The button {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well , if the button was actually on {disfmarker} project manager: Oh . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Oh , yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Minor detail there . user interface: C 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one T_V_ set , so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something . industrial designer: Maybe {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah . project manager: Yeah , it would have t industrial designer: Maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be um yeah not very obtrusive . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Obviously something small that's {disfmarker} Yeah , that's a good point . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . Then it wouldn't , it probably wouldn't be able to use {disfmarker} It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah , okay . user interface: Would it need a battery then ? project manager: Maybe , um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Pr probably . project manager: Probably , I mean . industrial designer: Unless it could be {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: That's your department you'll have to sort that out . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Okay . Um , unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the T_V_'s supplied from . I mean the power for the T_V_ . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , you'll have to {disfmarker} industrial designer: So , mm , more research into that one . project manager: Yeah , you'll have to investi Do some research on that , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm . project manager: alright ? Great . Um , alright , and I'm sure that , um um , the glow-in-the-dark , fluorescent , whatever , system , um is a go ahead . Is everyone interested in that ? industrial designer: Y marketing: On the buttons ? user interface: I I like the light up suggestion . I think that would be better . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: 'Cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time , so industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: {gap} it doesn't {disfmarker} user interface: I would go for {disfmarker} marketing: It could it could be a tactile thing as well . Um right , if w if we're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger . And there's something on it . S you know like up arrow down arrow for , for volume . industrial designer: Like a raised {disfmarker} marketing: Um , and I don't know what we could do for , for channels . S user interface: Well just the numbers could be embossed , couldn't it ? Like raised . marketing: The numbers themselves . user interface: Yeah . Could be raised . marketing: But then the like up button and down button for the channel , channel changing . user interface: Just little arrows , that you could feel , maybe ? industrial designer: Yeah {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Hmm . marketing: I just thought that {gap} it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up . I'm not sure . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: That's true . project manager: But I mean {disfmarker} industrial designer: And also y , uh Heather you mentioned before , um like how it should be accessible to everybody . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Um , so like big b um buttons , {gap} for people you are visually impaired . The glow-in-the-dark or light up won't make any difference anyway . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: So like you say tactile might be better , because it'd be more available to everybody . user interface: That , I think that's good , yeah . project manager: Yeah . Could we somehow {disfmarker} We could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: 'Cause I d I don't think that glow-in-the-dark material , um , like the actual soft plastic , um , costs that much more than other colours . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: No , it's not these days . user interface: No , I wouldn't say so . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I mean , it's quite easily accessible . project manager: Yeah . marketing: I guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you're s and then it goes , industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: That's good {disfmarker} Yeah that a good idea . marketing: so if , if you're like changing the volume during a movie . I know , I'm thinking of mostly when you're watching a movie you turn all the lights off right . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: And you don't want to turn on the lights , {vocalsound} to turn it down , because there's suddenly an explosion , and it's gonna wake up the baby . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: Um , so if you touch the button , it kind of reactivates it . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: It lights up for {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: That , yeah , that's a good idea . marketing: On self timer . industrial designer: So self-timed lighting . project manager: Alright we have five minutes left marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Um , I {disfmarker} project manager: um , for the meeting , but I think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close . Um , what was {disfmarker} I missed the last moment , reading that . What were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ? marketing: Oh , just if it was kinda the same way that a cell You know how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: Um , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again . project manager: Mm . So it could be any button that would be pressed . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , and you , you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit , and it gives a faint glow . industrial designer: So , self-timed {disfmarker} marketing: So if you have all the lights off in your living room , you'll , you'll temporarily see it . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Because usually you're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: So {disfmarker} project manager: That's probably feasible . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow-in-the-dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ? Do we have to kind of decide what we're gonna do with this . industrial designer: I think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yeah , okay . industrial designer: And I think that's un unique as well . user interface: Yeah . For visually impaired , yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: I mean , I haven't seen that . And as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just sort of like painted on , you know printed . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yeah , yeah . And it could {gap} , if it's that softer rubber material it'll be , maybe , um , uh , better for people with um els no industrial designer: {gap} durable . project manager: what's it called , R_S_I_ , what was it that we were talking about ? industrial designer: Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Oh right , the {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah instead of like hard buttons . industrial designer: Repetitive strain injury . project manager: Okay . Um , did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ? industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ? user interface: If {disfmarker} project manager: Like should we do both ? Or we can have one or the other ? Because it might , for , for our design purposes , I mean , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: And it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with . marketing: I was gonna say , {gap} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Exactly . It the {disfmarker} it might be perceived as tacky , glow-in-the-dark . project manager: Yeah . marketing: It's kind of like Eighties neon-style . industrial designer: Yeah , and we could {disfmarker} marketing: Um , whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable . industrial designer: Yeah there are now like loads , or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well , marketing: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: which could like link in with the company colours . Like it could be blue or green or yellow , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Right . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: or like we've just limited t with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so {disfmarker} project manager: Right . Alright . So we've decided on lighting up things . user interface: I was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the um Real Reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised . industrial designer: Yeah . Every time the , that it lit up , you c that could light up as well . marketing: Mm . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Or , or the , whate project manager: Yeah . user interface: {gap} Yeah . project manager: But with the same thing , I mean . If you touch the button and then it could be , it could be lit up as well . marketing: That's true . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . Okay . project manager: Is {disfmarker} Are you okay with that ? Okay . Cool . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Um {disfmarker} Alright . So I think that um that completes most of our um our more uh practical decisions . industrial designer: Is {disfmarker} project manager: And now it's up to designing . And um making sure that this can be feasible . And do you have anything {disfmarker} marketing: What um {disfmarker} project manager: Do you have anything to say ? {vocalsound} marketing: Oh sorry . Yeah well , I was just gonna throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control . Um , it , you , 'cause you mentioned face plates . So I I dunno if there's something that diff , you know like five different face plates . I dunno if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote . Um industrial designer: Okay . Like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something . user interface: Oh yeah . Interchangeable thing ? marketing: Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} project manager: Like an iPod or something ? user interface: That would be good . industrial designer: Yeah , or {disfmarker} marketing: Exactly , like an iPod . project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Exactly . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Or , or like mobile ph . project manager: Like a cellphone ? Yeah . marketing: And I dunno if we'd want to go with like T_V_ show themes or something . Like a Bart Simpson faceplate . user interface: Yeah , and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well . marketing: {vocalsound} But {disfmarker} industrial designer: {gap} Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Y Could buy extra {disfmarker} marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Accessories . marketing: Exactly . You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on . industrial designer: Person {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . Well , that's great . user interface: That's a good idea . Yeah . project manager: Yeah . I think that we should incorporate that . industrial designer: Interchangeable . project manager: 'Cause that wouldn't be very expensive at all . industrial designer: Um , als project manager: You'd just get one mould , user interface: No . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: throw some plastic in it , you know . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Interchan And also possible {disfmarker} I mean , uh , we could gain out of that by advertising certain T_V_ shows , or {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . Well , that might be com problematic with um copyright issues . user interface: Oh yeah . marketing: Right . project manager: So , if it takes off then we'll , we'll , we'll try that out . industrial designer: Yeah . But if we , there is {disfmarker} user interface: If w industrial designer: Yeah . We could {disfmarker} Um , the environmental factor , we didn't bring that up again . project manager: Right . marketing: Right . project manager: We'll have to do more research . Like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , um , the way it'll look . Um , does it need to be reached a de industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Do we need to reach a decision on that right now ? industrial designer: Um , I've {disfmarker} project manager: Because we need to investigate the financial implications . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . Is it {disfmarker} industrial designer: Let's {disfmarker} project manager: Does it need to be uh decided on now ? Or should we {disfmarker} industrial designer: I think we could probably leave that 'til later on , then . project manager: Okay . Good . Alright then . Anyone else have anything more to say before we close ? user interface: No . industrial designer: No . project manager: Alright , well . Let's have lunch and we'll discuss this later . user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Alright ? industrial designer: Okay . Thank you .
