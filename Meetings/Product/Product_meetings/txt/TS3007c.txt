project manager: Hello again . user interface: Hello . industrial designer: Hi . {vocalsound} marketing: Hey , Project Manager . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Um , Project Manager , I have something to tell you . project manager: Mm yeah . user interface: I have a little problems with my laptop . project manager: Okay . user interface: And uh s s s so I had a little less time to complete . project manager: Okay . user interface: No , a little problem , uh {vocalsound} big problem . I just thought {disfmarker} marketing: What was it , problem ? user interface: Um , it didn't work anymore . {vocalsound} marketing: The laptop ? user interface: The entire Windows uh {disfmarker} marketing: It hang {disfmarker} hung . user interface: It it hung . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Ha-ha . Oh . Project Manager . project manager: {vocalsound} Yes . {vocalsound} Yes . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: You're our Project Manager . project manager: {vocalsound} Your project manager . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Welcome to the conceptual design meeting industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: for Real Reaction . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh , hello again . Uh it's uh the same as the last time . Uh uh , also this time there will be uh three presentations . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: And we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts . Um uh , and at the end , uh I uh , when I finish it off I have some uh input from uh a master class I uh {vocalsound} visited . {vocalsound} {gap} information . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: During lunch , yeah . marketing: Master . user interface: He's the master , yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: The the the the the concepts on uh {disfmarker} we uh {disfmarker} where we uh must reach a decision on . Um uh , our {disfmarker} from uh are of two sorts . marketing: Master of {disfmarker} project manager: Components concepts and user interface concepts . Uh , the first one is uh really about the the the the the total package uh with uh {disfmarker} Well , we have decided to do a {disfmarker} do the uh {disfmarker} with a touch-screen that must be a case around it so uh it won't be uh uh as breakable . Uh how how about the energy ? Can you uh can you reload it or uh just have batteries which you must exchange ? Uh , the user interface concept . Uh , with the type and uh the the supplements . So uh where to put what button . {vocalsound} And uh uh I would say uh {disfmarker} Jans , can you begin ? industrial designer: Yeah , sure . project manager: Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: At the end , uh {disfmarker} I will take notes uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder . industrial designer: Okay . Uh , let me see . I think it's this one . Ha . user interface: Wow . industrial designer: Right . Uh , well , I'll be talking about the components . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh , what I did was I reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two uh different uh age groups . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Uh below forty five and above . And uh I just uh watch what the differences are and I checked uh , well , what what d do we want , and {gap} how can we uh d aim a at uh the target group . Well uh what I found was that a senior um {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} senior citizens uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} I'm sorry . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Ye Ah , it's {vocalsound} it's okay . marketing: Okay . Go on . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} They , well , they like more the {disfmarker} they like the traditional materials , like wood and and such more . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Wood and chrome . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: And uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes . Um , uh they they they they like luxurious uh styles , where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more uh soft materials . Think of the Teletubbies , for instance . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh uh , soft and fluffy and colourful and {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well uh , shapes are curved and round . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Y y you get {vocalsound} the picture . And uh they like sports and gaming , and that gives them uh the vitality . Uh , so w well uh , firs project manager: One one little question . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Um about the the material . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Uh a soft material for a remote control ? industrial designer: No , I'll I'll get to that . project manager: Okay . Yeah . industrial designer: You you'll see . Yeah . project manager: Thank you . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh , well f first off , let's start start with the energy . W I uh I had a choice between uh a few different uh sources . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: But uh the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic . Uh kinetic , that's when you move something , then uh it gets energy . I figured , well that's ki kinda high-tech , when when you have a remote control that well , when you pick it up , it has power . That would be actually very nice , uh I figured . project manager: Oh . industrial designer: Well , we could also use a battery , that's a bit {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah but when the power gets low , you have to shake it or something ? project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah yeah , you c just you have to shake it around a little bit . marketing: Uh , and uh uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: And then then it d then it has some more uh energy . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Hmm . industrial designer: Well , y you could just go for a battery . Or you can go for both ? user interface: Oh , have you considered the option of using a solar panel ? industrial designer: Yeah , I actually did . But uh the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l uh light . Well , sunlight preferably . user interface: W {gap} nah . industrial designer: Uh , and you you could you could use normal light , but uh you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something . user interface: Mm . Yeah . industrial designer: Uh for uh ultimate b uh {vocalsound} n uh use of uh solar panels , you could actually use uh {disfmarker} you could use uh solar panels , but uh you ha you'd have to implement them into uh the remote control , leaving you uh a bit less space for the interface . marketing: Mm yeah . It's too less space . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So uh {disfmarker} so i i it it wo what's actually {disfmarker} I I c just in f I've figured it out that well , uh seeing that you'll always be uh within the l uh distance of T_V_ , and the {disfmarker} from T_V_ there comes a a a whole bunch of light . So it would actually power itself uh from a T_V_ . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: But , well you just take up all the space , and you wouldn't uh have the full amount of power actually used . user interface: Okay . project manager: But you prefer kinetic ? industrial designer: So {disfmarker} I I prefer kinetic because it's uh {disfmarker} well , the costs aren't that much higher , and um , ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery . project manager: Okay . Yeah , but you don't move a a remote control too much . industrial designer: I mean , if {disfmarker} No , but uh d Well , you pick it up and you press buttons and y well , you {disfmarker} project manager: And that's enough to to keep the energy level uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , well uh actually it is . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: And it it {disfmarker} if it isn't , you just shake it a bit and and add add with power up again . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: But , what l what Jarek said , you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . And for rest , you'd just add juice on the battery . project manager: Okay . marketing: And when the battery doesn't work , I usually shake it too . So {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Thank you , Tim . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Exactly . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Like slamming on it . {vocalsound} It's exactly the same . {vocalsound} industrial designer: And so that {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh well , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: f furthermore , you you {disfmarker} we {gap} {disfmarker} uh checked uh the cases . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: We have uh different options uh concerning the cases . You ha I {disfmarker} you sim uh you simply add a basic uh standard uh model uh {disfmarker} it was kind of square and uh I figured that's a bit boring . So you you {disfmarker} we could go for uh the single curved or the double curved . Um , single curve , it's just a {disfmarker} well , uh , you know , it's just uh a nice curve . Or but but you could go in a in an double curves . And that's {gap} like several different dimensions . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: That gives you an whole new uh effec project manager: Dynamic dynamic look ? marketing: Hmm . industrial designer: Yeah , that gives you a younger and uh more high-tech look , I f I figured . But , that uh we'll discuss later . marketing: But , are you going to draw it ? industrial designer: What ? user interface: Th th yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: You want me to draw in three-D_ ? marketing: The {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh , I c I can't imagine . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Uh , yeah , I ca I ca I could I could show you . I could show you . marketing: I can't imagine how how how it looks like . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well uh let's say y uh you uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Let's say that's your standard uh {disfmarker} marketing: Design . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: That's a bit your d standard design . But you could actually go like uh something like this . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: And then uh in three-D_ effect you could go {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: So y you you just {disfmarker} Yeah , this is a {disfmarker} this {vocalsound} bit uh difficulty in {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} I didn't take a major in art . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But but you could have uh uh a whole new uh the back back the the the depth , you could you could uh just play around a bit with . marketing: Oh , okay . Okay . industrial designer: You you don't have to use standard uh {disfmarker} marketing: Oh , okay . project manager: A little artistic . industrial designer: Yeah you could {disfmarker} y It leaves more space for creativity . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Uh that might be an idea , marketing: Okay . industrial designer: but {vocalsound} just a {disfmarker} Well , furthermore , uh well , uh plastic versus rubber ? You {disfmarker} We could choose uh what uh what's better , plastic um or rubber . I I ch prefer rubber because it feels uh {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: It's soft . industrial designer: Yeah , it's soft and it's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I like soft . project manager: {vocalsound} That's the material the younger people want uh , ain't it ? user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah I mean uh plastic uh is {disfmarker} Plastic also has that cheap feeling to it , {vocalsound} like plastic uh {disfmarker} Your your {disfmarker} I usually associate plastic with uh something that's cheap . Uh that's maybe just me , but {disfmarker} Uh , we could uh uh , oh , talk about it later . Uh furthermore , buttons . Uh traditional uh or a touch screen . Well , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_ . And uh chip set , well uh if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go uh with a simple chip set . But uh if we decide to go on a n uh um L_C_D_ screen , we would use an uh {disfmarker} we have to use an a advanced chip set . And that would bring uh the necessary costs with with it . So that's something we th have to keep in mind . If it isn't uh manageable uh budget-wise , we'd have to go over to uh to sim to simple buttons . marketing: Well , I think uh we're going to sell tell {disfmarker} ten millions of them . So uh I bet a big company in uh Korea or Taiwan , like uh Samsung , can give us uh a big discount on the chips , so {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah , probably . marketing: U usually , chips are uh aren't more expensive than one dollar . industrial designer: Yeah , probably , but {disfmarker} But uh yeah , that's that's {disfmarker} marketing: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That that shouldn't be a real issue , I think . industrial designer: That shouldn't shouldn't be uh that big a issue . I'll I'll I'll just add , uh uh I put a big summary here , so we could discuss it a bit . Uh {gap} what i what are your ideas {gap} concerning battery versus kinetic ? marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Um , I think you should use kinetic as a back-up . industrial designer: Yeah , you you you should {disfmarker} we should {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , a combination . user interface: A combination , yeah . industrial designer: A combination . Uh , {gap} you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic . When you pick it up , it charges up . marketing: Yeah . Like an uh aku uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Acu uh , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah yeah , I know . user interface: Okay . Yeah . project manager: Just like the watch from Seiko . marketing: {vocalsound} Well , {gap} . Yeah . user interface: Psycho-kinetic . {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , I con Exactly . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: What uh what do you think ? project manager: I I uh I would prefer uh both uh too . industrial designer: You agree ? project manager: Yeah . Combine them . industrial designer: Yeah ? Both ? marketing: Combine them . industrial designer: Okay . Uh , well that would bring the m m some more costs , but I mean the {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Who cares , right . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} That's the Project Manager's problem . {vocalsound} user interface: Buy a fifty cents battery and uh {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Of course . Fifty cent . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , {vocalsound} well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Fifty cent uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Uh , why doesn't {disfmarker} And then we have single-curved versus double-curved . user interface: Well maybe I have something in my presentation to uh to cope with that . industrial designer: {vocalsound} That {disfmarker} {gap} Okay . No , we'll we'll just wait and uh {disfmarker} Uh , plastic versus rubber . Any ideas ? marketing: Rubber . project manager: Rubber . Yeah . industrial designer: Uh , rubber ? user interface: Um , isn't possible to make combination with kind of rubber is {gap} or bendable remotes where you've got a {gap} . industrial designer: You {disfmarker} user interface: Or do you think it {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh , I figured it will be m rather than hard {disfmarker} user interface: Rubber casing , yeah . industrial designer: Nah , rubber c uh this is a casing , yeah . Rubber casing , marketing: Rather hard . industrial designer: because well if you use an uh d a touch-screen , uh it's just a casing uh around it . So um , you could go for plastic , but I figured {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Um , well d Maybe I can ask it right now the question that I have . industrial designer: I I I would choose rubber . user interface: Uh , is it possible uh of {disfmarker} is it necessary to make a touch-screen square ? It isn't , I think , yeah ? industrial designer: Well , m I don't know . No . marketing: Well , I think that touch-screens are generally square . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: But it's the case you put around it that makes the shape . user interface: We're {disfmarker} We put fashion in electronics , industrial designer: That isn't {disfmarker} user interface: so maybe we can uh {disfmarker} marketing: Hmm ? Yeah okay , but if you have a square uh L_C_D_ screen , and you put a case around it that has uh like bulbs or that that covers part of the L_C_D_ screen . user interface: Mm yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah , that would cover it . marketing: That {disfmarker} industrial designer: That that would solve the problem . user interface: Oh , yeah . Okay , I I get it . marketing: That's {disfmarker} it's custom customisable and {disfmarker} project manager: Mm yeah . industrial designer: So mm {disfmarker} Uh uh so uh so what are the opinions ? Uh rubber or plastic ? I I I prefer rubber . marketing: Yeah , me too . project manager: Me too . user interface: Okay . project manager: Yeah ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , you too ? user interface: That's good . industrial designer: You sure ? You {gap} you you seemed to hesitate a bit . user interface: Well , as long a as long as it's it's uh it's firm , and you don't uh {disfmarker} it's not bendable or something , project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Mm yeah . user interface: I th I think that goes too far . industrial designer: Yeah , it it shouldn't it shouldn't flop over when you hold it in your hand uh project manager: Okay . user interface: Oh . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No , that that that that's gonna {disfmarker} The the chip set will hold it firm in place , marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . industrial designer: and uh and and uh and a L_C_D_ screen also {disfmarker} user interface: It might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah it {vocalsound} m might it might . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Uh , tra uh traditional versus L_C_D_ , well I figured we we all set on that . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: And uh , then also the simple versus advanced . Well I figure if we go for L_ L_C_D_ , we we should have the advanced . project manager: Mm yeah . industrial designer: So that shouldn't be a problem . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay , well that's my uh {disfmarker} project manager: Thank you . industrial designer: Uh , you're welcome . marketing: Can I uh do my thing ? project manager: Yeah . Do your thing , Tim . marketing: It uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Do your thing . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} project manager: Bring it on . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Expert map . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay uh {disfmarker} Last week project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: I went to uh Paris and Milan for some trend-watching . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: For marketing . Our research and development department and I went to Paris and Milan . In Paris and Milan , we uh asked different people , uh differing in age and in income , uh the amount of money to spend , um {vocalsound} what they like in design uh and material nowadays . Findings . Our main audience , uh so that's people below forty , uh prefer the following . At first , the colours of fruit . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Very basic colours , like Janus explained . Um , fresh colours , uh green , red , uh strawberry red , uh yellow , banana yellow . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Um , considering material , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . They like spongy material , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Spongeball . marketing: like {disfmarker} yeah a sponge-ball . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Like a s soft material . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Janus m uh mentioned it also . I think he did some uh some findings himself . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well , the Teletubbies sh {gap} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} You wer you weren't in Paris ? {vocalsound} Okay . Like this . Like big uh g flashy colours . Fresh . project manager: Flashy . Yeah . marketing: It's nice , I think . Okay , our secondary audience , uh people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , uh materials like wood that {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , but wood is not a not a material you {disfmarker} which you build a a remote control of . industrial designer: Well , you could . You you could . marketing: No n j just j just a w project manager: Yeah but {vocalsound} never seen one . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} It'll float . marketing: No , okay , but just just a wooden uh look . project manager: Case . Oh , a wooden look , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Like uh you have those fake uh fake panels on the floor . user interface: Tables . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: The {disfmarker} that isn't wood anyway , but {disfmarker} Okay ? {vocalsound} But , that's our secondary audience . project manager: Yeah . marketing: So , uh we decided to take mm yeah the people below forty . project manager: Yeah . marketing: So , that {disfmarker} this doesn't apply . 'Kay , the third . Uh , there're some overall thoughts about new remote controls . They have to look fancy . Um , they should be technological in innovative . That means uh there have to be fancy things in . Uh , and easy to use . But that's common . My personal preferences . We have to aim at a mu at the {gap} main audience . And uh , therefore use fresh colours . project manager: Would you prefer uh uh {gap} that you can choose the colour of your uh remote control or {disfmarker} marketing: Uh , I'll I'll come to that in a second point . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . To customise your own remote control . project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Like the Nokia uh the removable covers , uh just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one . project manager: Yeah . Okay . marketing: Uh , a third , material being used uh could well be stuff like rubber . Um , two advantages . Uh , it fits within the current market trends . And uh it adds safety to your remote uh when you drop it . So {disfmarker} Uh to come back to your question , I think uh and the people in Milan and Paris also think that uh the rubber should be pretty hard . Like uh seen on regular mobile phones . Actually , they have a lot in common . The phones and the {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well , I actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote , so {disfmarker} Yeah . user interface: Ah . marketing: Yeah . Yeah . Okay . project manager: Maybe you could use your remote as a phone . user interface: {vocalsound} Hey . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Hey . project manager: There are numbers on it , so uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: That might be a next step . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , exactly . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh , in my second sheet of personal preferences , uh we have to reconsider the speech function {vocalsound} uh recognition . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh , it's very innovative . Innovative . project manager: So that you say um S_P_S_S_ , and it goes to uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , like something . project manager: Okay . marketing: You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak {disfmarker} uh speech recognition and stuff . But , we have to keep the cost in uh in mind , but it {disfmarker} user interface: Twelve fifty uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , it it can be uh very expensive . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: 'Kay , second . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh , building games like Snake or Tetris {vocalsound} to amuse the younger users . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh , also the link with uh mobile phones . Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , but you don't use that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} th games when you watching television , I think . industrial designer: Well , yeah . marketing: No , but {disfmarker} No , okay . But you don't use games when you're d when you're making a telephone call . It's just the same . user interface: When your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , okay . marketing: When you're at college . project manager: You take your remote control with you . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Take it . {vocalsound} industrial designer: You take your uh remote with you to school . {vocalsound} marketing: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No . You al {vocalsound} you also take {vocalsound} uh t {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} marketing: you take your IPac and go uh play games . Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Well , I do that , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , and um {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: And third , I stick with it , {vocalsound} the log-in functionality uh with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Ooh . S industrial designer: {vocalsound} Very nice . {vocalsound} marketing: That's it . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Uh great {gap} . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: In {disfmarker} Okay . Um the interface contents . Well that's a just simple PowerPoint mock-up I want to m make it more as dynamic for you so I'll draw there . But , the main concept is um take one big touch screen . Um , always display the primary buttons clear and visible . Maybe even li like this with uh {vocalsound} u uses of a lot of space . And uh make the menu structure changeable . So if you press um system , that's {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , well m multiple system options can , maybe five or ten or or one , can fit in . Or maybe even a step further when you want to um t um have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button . And um other buttons can may be displayed here if that's necessary . And um well , how do {disfmarker} uh do we want to look at uh uh f um {disfmarker} Yeah {vocalsound} Does a remote look {disfmarker} Well , it's {disfmarker} you've gotta hold it in one hand . So um the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small , so you can put it in inside your hands . And some remotes you can use with your thumb . But I think that's too difficult for this one . So you can make it s a little broader . Yeah . And here ? And maybe use your thumb on the on the main buttons . And use your other hands on the menu structure . So here are gonna be the program buttons . One , two {vocalsound} , three , four , et cetera . And the the volume control and program control maybe . And , down here , um , I added , this could be one uh big L_C_D_ . Um , the menu structure . So you can use it in uh in this way . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} One thing you've gotta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Um , {vocalsound} know that if you are changing the menu structure here , um {disfmarker} And well , I still believe you should keep displaying the buttons . But if you're programming the colour of the T_V_ , do not display twenty other options that are possible . Just keep it as simple as uh as possible . And do not use too many levels . Do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un-plus , and um push plus twenty times . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: But just the um uh just in one button if possible . And um , well , you kn you all know the T_V_ levels . Um , channel one , two . And when you get to n to uh to ten , ye and want to go back , uh well you have a problem . Just m most most modern T_V_s , you {gap} {disfmarker} you press one zero , and it goes to ten . And else , to one and through after that . So the s a button less . And um , things like teletext , put them in the menu . Things like um um {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: Yeah . Uh , what do you think about a back-and-forth come-up uh button ? project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , yeah w Yeah , I I find I must trying to uh tell it . marketing: {vocalsound} L like in uh internet explorer . {vocalsound} user interface: Is uh volume plus and minus ? And this is program uh plus and minus . Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah okay , but does it {disfmarker} that is for uh going from four to five . user interface: Yes . marketing: But if you go from two to eight , and you want {disfmarker} user interface: Or if you're watching Studio Sports on uh on seventeen , and your wife is watching some soap on two {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , and on two . That you can switch switch easy . user interface: Well yes , I think that's a good idea . But um , well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure . marketing: Yeah it is . Yeah . user interface: And if you're using that button a lot of times , well of course the menu will still be displayed on the screen . You just don't have to play games uh in-between . But if you're really switching between two channels , you won't have time uh to d use the other options . marketing: Mm no . user interface: Um , yeah already already told that . marketing: {vocalsound} That's it . user interface: Yeah . That's my conclusion . project manager: Oh , okay . marketing: Okay . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} I think we can discuss a little about the the three uh kind of revolutionary things uh Tim uh came with . The parental control , the games , and the voice recognition . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: There's n not uh too much decision on uh that one so uh {disfmarker} I think that parental control is a good function to uh to put in the remote . I don't know how you think about it . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: Well , I agree , just put it in the menu structure somewhere . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Um , yeah um system properties , um parental control . marketing: Yeah but {disfmarker} What I see uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents , children . user interface: Yeah . Mm . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Something like that . user interface: Um , w well , yeah . marketing: And w when you want to use the parents uh option , you have to {disfmarker} user interface: It it has to be fast . You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings . marketing: Yeah , ok project manager: No but I think most people uh find it uh much more important that their children don't watch uh sex or violence uh on the television , and uh wait uh ten or fifteen seconds longer , so they can uh finally watch it uh because of that . user interface: Mm-hmm . Why {disfmarker} Mm-hmm . You c may use {disfmarker} like when there's uh X_P_ , uh a simple log-on , d you just push uh one or two or three . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . Pu push parents . user interface: And if you push parents , then {disfmarker} marketing: That {disfmarker} then then then you have to uh go to three-digit uh log-in . user interface: Yeah . To log in . Yeah . And if you puts a ye marketing: Like two one three . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: Uh-huh . marketing: And it's in . user interface: And if you w you push p children , uh you don't have to uh log in , but you can only watch uh children's channels or uh {disfmarker} marketing: It automatically goes {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: Okay . Well {disfmarker} industrial designer: I don't know if it's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it . Because well it's a simple function , but it's gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time um to programming it . Because you'll have to start working with the profiles and such . And I'm not sure if it's actually worth uh investing that much time and effort into it . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it , industrial designer: I don't know what {disfmarker} project manager: because uh you {disfmarker} Yeah , you read many times in magazines same kind of stuff , and you heard on the news that uh that he Yeah , they believe that children uh are influenced by the television , industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Mm yeah . V violent T_V_ . project manager: and uh {disfmarker} Well , we're we're aiming uh to uh below uh forty uh years . But there are a lot of uh people will below forty who have uh children in young age uh who who want um to uh not watch uh violent or uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . Well , maybe um some idea on that . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , project manager: Yeah . user interface: 'cause if my grandad would buy this remote , he wouldn't want to bother with all all the all the {gap} uh things to do . marketing: Yeah , of course . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Just make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles or something . project manager: Yeah yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: That's a that's a better idea ? marketing: Yeah , w It just has to be w when it's deliver out of the store , it has to be just simple and plain . project manager: Yeah . Yeah , okay . marketing: But if you want to install it personally uh {disfmarker} If I got kids , and I could choose between uh two remote controls . One uh w with parent control and one without , and I would would buy the one with . project manager: Yeah , with and one without . Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Um , b well , still some question I have about how to incorporate those ones . marketing: I th Yeah . user interface: You're thinking about some channels they uh cannot see , but well , {vocalsound} I I {vocalsound} when I think , oh yeah , for the f for all the standard channels , and only for maybe after ten o'clock uh in the evening violent films and movies uh will come industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: and uh maybe maybe some some timing uh will be uh needed {vocalsound} instead of uh of channels , marketing: Yeah . user interface: because if you're watching uh , I don't know , you're in the {disfmarker} at day uh , cartoons will come up m on maybe Friday night . {vocalsound} I don't know . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , maybe it can work with show view . Uh , you you can control your video recorder with show view . user interface: {gap} {gap} project manager: Uh , when you tick in a number , it will uh start and end uh recording . But maybe there's some option that uh that t uh the kind of show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out . user interface: Yeah , the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show-view numbers of the programs that they {gap} remotes and edit it all , project manager: Yeah . That's true . Yeah . user interface: will have to decide uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah but yeah but that isn't possible . user interface: That isn't possible . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: But , well , if you want to {disfmarker} I i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control , uh let's say we do , and and well whatever , cho uh child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up {vocalsound} for instance . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Well uh , nob nobody's stopping the child from uh well checking uh the channel . marketing: Hmm . user interface: Well , yeah you could say if parental control is only {disfmarker} it it'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page-up then , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: But that {disfmarker} Well , I'm not sure because um for that to happen , you d you will have to receive a signal from the uh remote control , so it would , yeah , have to be constant uh constant signalling . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: What m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control . And that uh provides parental control , for instance . And that's just an optional uh device . So there's n that's {disfmarker} there's {gap} {disfmarker} uh besides uh the remote control , you'll have a separate uh {disfmarker} {gap} project manager: I wouldn't put it in an optional device . That that then then then it becomes too much , I think . industrial designer: Yeah ? project manager: If we do it , we we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise . marketing: Yeah , and {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , on a separate menu uh option . marketing: And and you know w uh when you install another device , uh children can still go up to the T_V_ , p pop open uh the thing and and and g project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , that's true . That's true , marketing: go to a channel . industrial designer: but uh at same instant , same happens when uh you have remote control . So {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , yeah of course . But {disfmarker} industrial designer: But , only difference is uh {vocalsound} the uh the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control , project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: and those people wouldn't uh necessary want it . marketing: Yeah . Ah it's {disfmarker} industrial designer: So , you {disfmarker} you'd be marketing: Yeah . Yeah , okay . But it's just an an added feature feature . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay . And what do you uh guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? I personally think that that becomes too much . user interface: Yeah , well yeah , I {gap} {disfmarker} project manager: It's more like it gets you to the functionality , but {disfmarker} user interface: A mail too from management that it's very popular to use voice recon recognition . project manager: Yeah . user interface: But I don't think when you're watching T_V_ uh , hearing loud noises from the T_V_ , someone screaming {vocalsound} one , and you f the channel switches , uh {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: Mm yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , like f voice recognition is too much , I think . But {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah . project manager: And games ? marketing: {vocalsound} games . It doesn't {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . I can see games happening . Yeah . user interface: W you can put it on chip anyway , so uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: That would {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} As long as it's {disfmarker} isn't a primary feature of the remote , marketing: That that doesn't c that doesn't co user interface: but uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , that that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources , I think . project manager: Okay . So that will uh {disfmarker} that that that must be in it , you think ? industrial designer: Yeah , that will be nice . project manager: Okay . So the games uh are in it . The voice recognition are not . And the parental control are user interface: Optional in project manager: optional ? marketing: Yeah , it's it's in it . But too ma I I think so , but {disfmarker} user interface: But how we do it ? {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . user interface: Well , I think also it's a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . So we should make it too complex . project manager: Okay . user interface: Is t some menu uh function , you choose parental control , and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on . marketing: Yeah . user interface: But uh how how it's gonna work uh uh will f be a problem . project manager: Yeah , okay . Uh , but uh will there uh uh {disfmarker} Like the first idea uh from uh {disfmarker} You can buy it without and uh with parental contr control ? Or are we going to put it in and uh just uh {disfmarker} user interface: Mm-hmm . Well {disfmarker} Ye I I think best would be uh to put it in and {vocalsound} make it an menu option . marketing: To put {disfmarker} user interface: You can put on {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , to put it in always . project manager: Yeah ? user interface: Yeah . And you can just uh s when you buy it , you can select um personal preference , parental control on , and the password or something . project manager: Mm yeah . industrial designer: Well , I don't know . I I figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it . So you could actually easily uh build in uh parental control . But it would would be uh more expensive . So , a and that that way uh you could make cheap model and a expensive model . Could ma make the uh {gap} simple model and the deluxe model , uh for instance . user interface: Oh , it's a p Yeah . marketing: Yeah , but T_V_s aren't capable of sending . industrial designer: Yes they are . Yeah . marketing: Yeah ? I thought they were just project manager: Yeah , you yo industrial designer: Yeah , you you have some T_V_s {gap} any {disfmarker} marketing: a able to receive . Yeah , some . But {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , but most often not . industrial designer: Yeah . That is true , that is true . user interface: Well , maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you cannot watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock . marketing: Yeah . user interface: And there's just some little uh clock in the remote . industrial designer: Well yeah , you could you could easily you could easily you could easily {gap} to the mote control . marketing: Yeah , j just some rules . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: But you still have the problem about uh the television itself . user interface: No , no , it's very simple . There uh th I h I've seen some of {gap} remotes who have a clock in it . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah yeah . user interface: So , the remote does doesn't transmit when it's after twelve clock . marketing: Yeah , okay . But , on the T_V_ user interface: Yeah ? marketing: at least my T_V_ , is a is a compartment which you can press . user interface: {gap} Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: And there are buttons uh behind it which you can use , if you d if you don't if you don't have a {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . Well , that's {disfmarker} To put it very blunt , that's not our problem . Just have um the parents buy uh some glue and uh {disfmarker} It's not not a part of the remote . marketing: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , of course . industrial designer: Yeah , that is true . Yeah , that is true . user interface: You have to f Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , you could you could you could go like {disfmarker} user interface: Uh , or make it ourselves very diffic industrial designer: uh that that would actually make uh things a lot more easy . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: You could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , I figured {disfmarker} I figure we could do that . Yeah , yeah , sure . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Uh , I'm not sure what marketing thinks about it , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Or j Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Ah {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: I have to uh {vocalsound} consult my legal advisor about it . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . So uh I think we have decided on the things that {disfmarker} Uh from Janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: The case will be double-curved and uh rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour uh that {disfmarker} with cover is removable . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: The buttons will be uh touch-screen . Uh but there may not be too many buttons . And in the the menu structure , uh there must not to be uh {disfmarker} Five minutes to go . Uh , too uh too many levels . And uh it must be easy to use . The parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex . And the games {gap} are in it . So {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: I think we have uh we have decided uh , okay . user interface: Okay . marketing: Consensus . project manager: Uh , little more . marketing: Oh . Oh . I I have one thing left . user interface: Oh . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Maybe for uh Jerome . user interface: Yeah ? I'm listening . marketing: Um , the views . Maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view . project manager: Like a like a moat or s or something . Yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Um , well {disfmarker} industrial designer: User profile . marketing: Like at {disfmarker} In the experts view , you have a lot of more buttons . project manager: Yeah , but you have that in the {disfmarker} user interface: What I was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you don't use it is simple . project manager: Yeah . You use the {disfmarker} user interface: And when you push uh system properties , uh entire list pops up with e ev all kind of f stuff you can program . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . It's already incorporated a little in that concept . marketing: Mm yeah , okay . Fairly enough . Yeah . industrial designer: Well yeah , you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users . marketing: Yeah , wh which buttons you like or not . industrial designer: Yeah , which buttons do you want to in it . Because you can you can like build in a back-forward button , and uh some po somebody would just want to watch two channels . marketing: Yeah . Yeah . Just leave the other numbers away . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah , you could you could m have people want uh want that . project manager: We take it to the other meeting , okay ? I have a little w uh little chat to do marketing: Okay . Go on . industrial designer: Ah , yeah , sure . project manager: and uh then we uh finish . marketing: {vocalsound} A little chat . {vocalsound} project manager: I went to uh a master class and uh uh two things uh are uh are uh {disfmarker} can come in handy uh for us . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: First thing uh is uh we talked about knowledge uh management . Knowledge engineering and uh uh the fact that uh that uh that the idea of knowledge , uh sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is {gap} uh like that . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} It's it's uh very hot at the moment , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: so it's it's mostly for the management expert to to look what other uh marketing: Marketing . project manager: marketing {disfmarker} or did I said management ? marketing: Management . project manager: Oh . {vocalsound} Just talking about myself . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's my function , to {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} W {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . Go on . {vocalsound} project manager: What other companies uh had to uh also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote , just some uh {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} Import export . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} And uh another one . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Som some bench-marker . project manager: Uh , they're a ha they're at {disfmarker} Yeah , benchmarking , that's the word I saw . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: I uh couldn't uh {disfmarker} Okay , uh another uh thing is uh there were there there was a survey , and um uh it came out that um people like to buy things from a single large provider , instead of those who uh are partnering uh with us . So , we must uh we must bring it as if uh Real Reaction is uh is big company , uh a trustful company , and uh it has m marketing: How {disfmarker} I know a marketing name for our product . project manager: Okay . marketing: R_ th R_ to the third power . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: R_ three . Real Reaction remote . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} I had a I had another idea to put uh uh the whole the whole idea of uh Real Reaction and uh uh uh a single brand and uh uh that kind of thing . user interface: Oh . marketing: Mm-hmm ? project manager: When you uh put on remote , you see a kind of a {disfmarker} just like when you telephone , you see a little uh animation . user interface: Uh , logo . Yeah ? marketing: Bling . project manager: Real Reaction remote . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: And uh with the with the with the motto , we put fashion in electronics . And then you go uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , okay , but it has to be like a split second , because {vocalsound} you have to put in a code also and {disfmarker} project manager: The {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . Well , you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds , they'll still remember it . project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . But w th the idea from this uh thing is that we must present it as a {disfmarker} as we are a a single large provider who will stand on our own . marketing: Yeah . user interface: And it it l linger on every time you see it . industrial designer: Well , if you if you have the l L_C_D_ screen , you can {gap} you can uh have a small logo i uh at the bottom . marketing: {gap} Yeah . industrial designer: And it could just stay there . marketing: That spins around like all the time . project manager: Mm yep , yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} Very annoying . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , that spins around or something . project manager: Also also . But we we are uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: It it's just like a uh globe in Internet Explorer . project manager: Yeah yeah y yeah yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah , something like that . A small icon . project manager: Okay , but uh think about that kind of things . user interface: Yeah , I {disfmarker} It's ok For f project manager: That's what they said in the master class . {vocalsound} {gap} . marketing: Okay . user interface: Oh , for the next meeting , right ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: N {vocalsound} Uh , next meeting starts in thirty minutes . marketing: Who uh {disfmarker} project manager: So uh maybe you can go to Paris and Milan uh {vocalsound} once again . marketing: {vocalsound} Who who gave you the master class ? project manager: The master class ? marketing: Ronald Betenberg ? project manager: {vocalsound} Franz Mehler's . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Okay , thanks . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Uh , very special , uh next uh session . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh idea that you uh {disfmarker} the the industrial uh development uh centre {vocalsound} and uh user interface uh will work together on a prototype . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: And uh will drawing it on the SMARTboard . So that's a kinda new uh thing . And um , the marketing expert will uh will uh ke he will be keeping busy with the product uh evaluation . marketing: Ah . project manager: But the most uh specific instructions will be sent to you by email . user interface: Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: So we're going to work together right now ? user interface: Stay here and {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , the {disfmarker} well , uh dids this what I uh what I heard . I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: In the master class . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Not in the master class . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: So you uh just wait for the specific instructions and uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} P_ . project manager: But I think it was a very uh very good uh session , uh gentlemen . user interface: Ah , no new email . industrial designer: Definitely . marketing: Me too . project manager: I will thank you all . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Well thank you too . {vocalsound} user interface: Thank you . Thank you very much . project manager: And uh {disfmarker} marketing: Thank you too , lord . project manager: Give me a good evaluation . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Uh-huh . marketing: {vocalsound} 'Kay guys , lot of success . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} You wish . user interface: {vocalsound} See you . industrial designer: M Aye ? Cheers . project manager: Cheers . See you in a half hour . industrial designer: Hey . project manager: But keep an eye on your uh laptops for a real uh industrial designer: Yeah , uh I'm not sure if we uh we {disfmarker} Because I saw something about individual actions . project manager: Yeah , but th there's there's still the my uh instructions that you will work together . user interface: Yeah . Here ? Or uh {disfmarker} project manager: That's not my problem . user interface: Yeah . If you got a {disfmarker} project manager: Bye-bye . {vocalsound} user interface: No . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well , yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Stupid manager . project manager: The project manager always works alone . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Right . Uh {disfmarker} {gap} Do you have new email ? user interface: No . Don't get what's {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm .
