project manager: {vocalsound} So um nice to see you again . Uh . So , uh . Tod uh for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes . Uh so we will see our three presentations . Um we will start with the uh Manager Expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device . marketing: Okay , can I have the laptop over here , or ? project manager: Yep . Oh , I don't think so . I think you have to come here . marketing: Okay . Have to get up . {vocalsound} project manager: I dunno . I think it should stay . marketing: Excuse me . industrial designer: Yeah , that's it . project manager: {gap} marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: Should stay in the square here . {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . project manager: Oh , maybe . marketing: Okay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control . project manager: Oh , you can put it here . Oh that's okay , it's jus marketing: Um so first of all we {disfmarker} what we did is we um conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects . Um we put them in a in our um usability laboratory and got them to , you know , um play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market . Um they , you know , seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly . Completely ugly . Um they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , you know , the the way users use remote controls when they're watching T_V_ . Um , that the layout of the remote controls didn't match they way that they used it . Um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls . Um so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects were using their remote control . And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most {disfmarker} by far the most used buttons on the remote control . Um and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , um , while the user's watching T_V_ . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Um the closest button that was used , well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , um which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , um , all the other , all the other um buttons , such as ch um audio and picture selection um configuration buttons and things were used , you know , l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour . Um we also asked users um which buttons had the most importance to them , you know , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control . And basically they came {disfmarker} they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , um note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance . Um and the audio and picture settings had a very {disfmarker} that well the users thought that um w the audio and picture settings were very uh weren't very important to them um , and they used them very infrequently a as well . {vocalsound} So we asked users what what um frustrates them the most about um current remote controls . And fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it . Um {vocalsound} they also said that it um it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control , especially when there's many buttons and it's a , you know , a c a a unintuitive interface . Um and then thirdly , they {disfmarker} some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and um cause u repetitive strain injury . {vocalsound} We also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the {disfmarker} on the remote control . In particular , do they want an L_C_D_ d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . They want these features , they want these high technology features . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Um for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features . Whereas um {vocalsound} the the trend was as users as users um became older and older uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control . So I guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market . Um and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics , um I think we're focusing on the younger younger um target demographic , and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control . project manager: Hmm . marketing: That's my dic that's my presentation . Thank you . project manager: Thank you . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . project manager: So , um maybe now we can talk about a user interface and uh about the technical function of this device . So uh Pet Peter , can you talk say something about that ? industrial designer: Well , okay , yeah . Yeah , but the user user interface is responsible . project manager: No . user interface: B you think uh I I'm User Interface Manager . project manager: Ah . industrial designer: Okay , so {gap} . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Sorry , I'm {disfmarker} Sorry . Sorry . user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . Okay . project manager: {gap} user interface: If I could go there with this cable . industrial designer: You're scaring me with L_C_D_ man . And speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very e expensive . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , it's true , but , you know , they're features that users want , industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: so it's {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think , user interface: {gap} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: so I think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote . industrial designer: At least we have couple of months t to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Sh okay . {gap} marketing: It is true . user interface: Where's delete button ? Okay . Oh I'm sorry . {vocalsound} {gap} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} user interface: {gap} Okay . marketing: That's the wrong one , I think . project manager: Yeah , it's still Bob Morris . user interface: Oh . Presentation three ? project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah you should have put yes . industrial designer: Because you cancelled it . Yeah . project manager: Click on yes . user interface: Oh . {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} yeah . industrial designer: Yep . user interface: Okay , so here is my presentation about technical function design . I will talk about different components and s of system and how they react together . Okay , uh , first what is a remote control ? Simply it's a device , as you know , for uh , for sending some commands by some waves to uh another device to to tell different commands uh with this device . And the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device . Uh i it has different blocks , different blocks . Uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands . And then inter then make uh these keyboard commands , uh in interpret these int uh keyboard commands . And then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air and uh uh this air this uh wave uh will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever , to uh r to realise the command . Okay , {vocalsound} uh about {disfmarker} what I found about uh different uh these different blocks are uh , usually there are two different methods uh to {disfmarker} for designing a remote control . They are based on infra-red uh waves or uh uh radio waves . industrial designer: You still want me the presentation . user interface: There are two different uh uh solutions I mean . This is uh this can be uh uh the the differences the th between different kind of waves , infra-red or radio waves . And uh also as uh I understood , and uh I think it was a part of uh Bob , uh uh presentation , people prefer to have uh to have uh the remote control with less button . So for the electronic part , working and interfacing , with button , we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having uh some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options , and showing o something on T_V_ and putting less lesser stuff on the uh on the remote control . And uh personal preferences , uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with {disfmarker} uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way . And uh uh again , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as I see . Okay . That was my presentation . marketing: Okay . I have a question . user interface: Uh-huh . marketing: Do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home ? user interface: Uh , I don't think so , because uh we can make uh we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency . So they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the {vocalsound} with other devices inside the home . marketing: Okay . project manager: So can we use any any frequency ? industrial designer: Yeah , it should be okay {gap} . project manager: We have the right to use any frequency ? user interface: Uh no but as I know , there is a range for uh for this uh f for for uh for this stuff , for designing this circuit . We can we can we can tune our uh transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we don't need to ask any permission . project manager: Okay . And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same {disfmarker} have our remote control , for example ? And so do they have the same frequency , or ? user interface: Uh for this I'm not uh I I don't know the solution , but one solution can be something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave , so the only your T_V_ can understand it project manager: Okay . A kind of identification {gap} , user interface: Yeah , identification code inside the {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah f {vocalsound} uh I know about this , since it's my {disfmarker} it's exactly my field , so . project manager: okay . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: It's uh kind of handshaking , uh , when starting to {disfmarker} uh when you start to communicate with the your T_V_ then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote . project manager: Yeah . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: So so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the T_V_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen . Well it can be a problem sometimes , but most of the time it works okay . project manager: Okay . user interface: The password may simply {disfmarker} uh or uh i identification code may simply solve this problem . A specific uh remote control has a specific f industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah but we we don't have to think uh about this because I think as a function designer that we will use the already made uh circuits which we probably bu buy . It's worth to buy . project manager: Hmm . industrial designer: And they have these problems solved so . So we don't have to think about these . user interface: Mm . marketing: Okay . project manager: Okay . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: So , maybe you can talk about the function , and {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . industrial designer: Yes . I have only a couple of things because I had {disfmarker} I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this uh uh in this company . I was used to use Linux before , so . But I tried to tried to break through this {gap} too , I guess . project manager: Open . industrial designer: Mm . Ah . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay . {vocalsound} How to make it big ? project manager: Slide show . user interface: Five . {gap} industrial designer: Slide show . Okay , thanks . {vocalsound} project manager: It should work , so you can {gap} . industrial designer: Okay . Oh so I will speak about working design . That's the first slide . Uh what uh I have to do ? A look at what the other company {disfmarker} Okay so uh presently I am looking what is possible to use , what circuits to use and stuff like that because uh I didn't work uh with these uh circuits so far so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication {disfmarker} for the I_R_ circuits and so on , so I'm currently looking what is available on the web . And uh I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , so , I would be glad if you can tell me about them . project manager: Mm . Yeah . industrial designer: So , you know . Uh , okay findings , that's {gap} the point that I'm working on currently but uh so far I I was uh looking what what are the blue circuit , I mean radio wave {disfmarker} radio frequency circuits are available now , marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: but the prices I read are high . So , I know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can uh you can make the T_V_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on , user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Hmm . industrial designer: but you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the um infra-red control instead of R_W_ but we will discuss it later maybe . Uh . Components to use , I'm not exactly sure what I will use for the design of the circuit . It depends uh on whether we will use the L_C_D_ and mainly the speech recognition , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: because the speech rec Yeah ? marketing: Are we um are we planning to take an off the shelf an O_E_M_ component for the radio wave circuit , or are we planning to construct our own circuit board ? industrial designer: No no no no no . This we this we buy I think , because it's rather cheap nowadays and it's not worth to construct ourselves . marketing: Okay s So we just buy a circuit board and {vocalsound} industrial designer: Exactly . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: But I'm not sure about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition . This I prefer that we should make ourselves . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: But it depends whether we take a decision to use it . Same thing . It's fairly expensive to use these circuits . So , speech recognition {disfmarker} well , L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_ , project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: so I agree on using any kind of L_C_D_ , less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the {disfmarker} what does it offer , you know . user interface: Mm . project manager: Yeah . So what do you think would be the price , it would be out of range ? industrial designer: Yeah , I'm {disfmarker} project manager: Or it would be maybe feasible ? industrial designer: Oh . I was not thinking too much about the price . But if we use the L_C_D_ uh even the radio frequency communication with the T_V_ set and the backlight and uh related things like the photo diodes and stuff , it should be okay . If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: It depends of you if if the M_E_ or U_I_D_ , project manager: Mm . industrial designer: I'm sorry about the names , I don't really know , uh want to have it like in metal or in plastic , these things , it it depends on you not {disfmarker} Because the the the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and stuff like that , so . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: We will discuss it afterwards . Oh , this is nothing . This is just my notes on what to use . And uh my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit , but from the point of view uh of the design and price , I would stick to I_R_s . That's my opinion . Uh I mean if infra-red uh circuit not not the radio frequency . project manager: Why ? Because it's simpler ? industrial designer: Because because the the range where you can use it is fair . project manager: Yeah . Mm . industrial designer: It's okay I think . And the price is fairly cheap for this . project manager: Okay . It's a a price matter . industrial designer: Well , depends . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Jus just the price . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: Otherwise I don't care what I put there because it's the chip which I buy or which we buy . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: So I I I think it's o y o {vocalsound} . marketing: What how much more expensive ? Are we talking three times more expensive ? project manager: {gap} industrial designer: Well , three to three to five . marketing: Or ten times more expensive ? Or {disfmarker} industrial designer: N not ten times , marketing: Okay . industrial designer: but it depends what what we {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah yeah . That's still a lot . I think it's it's probably not worth spending the extra money , project manager: Hmm . Yeah . marketing: because I mean all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red . industrial designer: {gap} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So it's not worth spending the extra money . project manager: Well I {gap} , oh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Th they are used to use it when they can see the T_V_ so , I don't know . project manager: On the other side , we want to have something new . marketing: Yeah . project manager: You know , where marketing: Yeah . project manager: we want to to have something new and So we I think we should still thinking about it . But maybe {gap} . marketing: But I think , based on my usability studies I th I feel that users are {disfmarker} prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , you know , the difference between infra-red or radio waves . project manager: Okay . marketing: So I think we're better off spending money in the usability phase . industrial designer: {gap} You the user interface , and management man , uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . Yeah . user interface: Mm . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: Uh okay , that's it for me . project manager: Okay , thank you Peter . industrial designer: 'Kay . project manager: So um I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control . Um marketing: Mm . project manager: first um , they say that's uh about something about t teletext . Uh apparently it becomes from {disfmarker} according to them it becomes out of date . Out-dated . And uh {disfmarker} Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext . Um . So I think we can avoid the teletext . Um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for T_V_ , not for D_V_D_ and other devices , because it make it {disfmarker} it makes it's too complex and uh because we have not much time for this project we should stay on T_V_ on the {disfmarker} only specific T_V_ remote control . industrial designer: I agree . {vocalsound} project manager: The third {vocalsound} the third one is uh about the the the image of the company . So um uh we should we should keep uh {disfmarker} The the product should be recognisable . Uh , uh It's {disfmarker} That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is uh , we put fashion of {disfmarker} in electronics . So , when people see the the remote control , they should say oh it's from Real Reaction and he s they should recognise the company . So , um {disfmarker} So now we we should take the decision what we are going to {disfmarker} what function we will have on this uh on this remote control . So , mm , are we going to use L_C_D_ , speech recognition ? Uh . marketing: Well , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need . project manager: Yeah . marketing: And then we can move on to the more advanced features . user interface: Mm . Yes . project manager: Maybe , maybe . industrial designer: Okay , so the available things are L_C_D_ , the buttons and everything . Uh radio frequency depends . And , well the recognition it depends on you guys . project manager: Yeah but first maybe what is {disfmarker} what are the usual function of a standard remote control ? industrial designer: You should probably speak . project manager: I mean industrial designer: Okay . project manager: what do {disfmarker} marketing: Okay , well , I mean the obvious one is changing channels . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: I think we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So , yeah . marketing: Yeah , okay . project manager: So , turning channel , of course . Volume setting . marketing: {gap} industrial designer: Uh just one note to the chan channel changing . Do we {disfmarker} will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ? I mean those nine plus one or two ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: I think it would be a b {gap} industrial designer: Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Mm . {gap} project manager: On the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it's {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , I {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay so so we keep all these all these buttons . project manager: Maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens , like user interface: Yeah yeah , at least nine , ten button . project manager: uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Like ten plus , five plus , one plus , one minus or something . project manager: Yeah . Maybe something like that . industrial designer: Or using the names and the keyboard {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} Ah yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Uh . industrial designer: I dunno . user interface: Or {disfmarker} project manager: Maybe {disfmarker} user interface: Or something {gap} . project manager: Oh I don't know . Oh . Maybe we could have key buttons , like uh discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and {disfmarker} industrial designer: You mean like hierarchical structure . project manager: And inside this this thing you can move , maybe switch . user interface: Mm-hmm . Okay . Like categorising channels . project manager: If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus . industrial designer: Okay , so s user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Oh sorry . project manager: I It just an idea . user interface: Okay . project manager: I don't know what you think about that but . industrial designer: So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably , to to tell you {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , probably , yeah , yeah . marketing: To have some feedback . Yeah . industrial designer: Okay , user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: so I'll make a note on L_C_D_ . marketing: We could maybe also c um incorporate Petre's idea of the um slider for the volume , with the channel . user interface: Okay . project manager: Okay . marketing: So we c you could quickly just {vocalsound} {vocalsound} through many channels . industrial designer: Yeah . Like roller for the {disfmarker} Yeah . Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} For the channels , perhaps . project manager: {vocalsound} Anything else ? marketing: So we've got channel and volume . Um . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: So we are still s speaking about the common devices user interface: {gap} industrial designer: or we are inviting the new one ? marketing: I think so . project manager: Yeah . marketing: I think basically the core functions we want , and then more advanced ones . project manager: What about the settings of the T_V_ ? Because it's button we don't use very often , but it's {disfmarker} we need it anyway . So {disfmarker} user interface: So uh we don't have any uh we don't have uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: we should just design the remote control and we sh we don't have any access to the to the T_V_ design or we can change some design . Because one solution for this um uh uh ch changing channels is to see a summary of all channels , some some preview of all channels and then you can {disfmarker} industrial designer: On the screen , you mean ? user interface: Yeah . Yeah b {vocalsound} industrial designer: Not on the control , but on the screen . user interface: Not on the control , on the screen , on the T_V_ screen . industrial designer: Well , this would avoid L_C_D_ , then . user interface: And then {disfmarker} marketing: I don't Oh , I don't but I don't think we're we're the ones . I mean this remote control we're developing is a generic control for all T_V_s , I think . project manager: Yeah , yeah . I don't know if it's possible to to watch something on T_V_ {disfmarker} user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Oh . W I I think it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the T_V_ to to to print these things . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Well it wi it will be still more expensive , but for the L_C_D_ and this stuff is no problem in the price . user interface: {gap} Mm-hmm . marketing: Okay . project manager: So , what are we doing with the settings ? Because settings {disfmarker} if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons , so . Maybe with the L_C_D_ we can do something with less buttons , but {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: But then you don't want to make the L_C_D_ display too complicated at the same time . project manager: Mm . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Two T_V_s . marketing: {vocalsound} I mean there's always {disfmarker} we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere , under a cover or at the back of {disfmarker} under a slide or some project manager: Yeah . Oh yeah . industrial designer: Like ma project manager: Oh , the {gap} . industrial designer: We we could have for example two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Or I dunno . user interface: {gap} {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Or like children and grandfather's mode , marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: and the , well the the user user interface: Mm . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: not the user , the man mana T_V_ manager mode {vocalsound} . Ah , I dunno . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Okay . So we have five minutes left . Um . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Uh . marketing: So I think s the settings we th we are agreeing {disfmarker} are agreed that they're required . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: It's just how to a project manager: {vocalsound} We should hide them somewhere . industrial designer: Hide them , okay . project manager: In the menus of the L_C_D_ or in the back of the remote control , or something like that . marketing: Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Uh , okay , what else ? industrial designer: Um . {gap} Yes . marketing: I mean a power button's obviously industrial designer: {vocalsound} This I was thinking . Do we need a power button at all ? marketing: uh required . industrial designer: Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? Because generally {disfmarker} project manager: It's it's a kind of setting , I think . It should fit in those settings functions . user interface: Mm . Settings . project manager: Because it's not a very current useful function . marketing: Uh , well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off . project manager: No , I think it's after after five minutes or something {gap} a timer {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes . Well I I uh project manager: I I think , no ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: But if you're watching T_V_ for two hours , you don't want your T_V_ to turn off after five five minute {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: You don't need to {disfmarker} every five minutes to keep it alive . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh probably . Okay , so we should keep this button . user interface: Yeah . marketing: I mean based on our usability studies again , um {vocalsound} pe um people said that the power button was v a very relevant button . project manager: Oh okay , yeah . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Um , you know , it was nine out of ten industrial designer: Okay , so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff , marketing: re relevance . industrial designer: we could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are {disfmarker} you just turn on the T_V_ and if you close it , it will project manager: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: turn off the T_V_ . marketing: {gap} industrial designer: If if you like this , {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . B Okay . industrial designer: Because , well {gap} {disfmarker} it's maybe question for you t marketing: I think we need to concentrate on the , you know , the major usage of the th of the control , user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yeah . marketing: which is you sit down , you turn on your T_V_ , you change channels , you change the volume , you turn the T_V_ off . project manager: Yeah . So s yeah . marketing: Um and all the other f functionality is industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , they can yeah they can be hide somewhere by a cover or something like this . marketing: not used very often . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Like covering cu . project manager: On the back , or {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . I mean like the {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , like mobile phone covering . industrial designer: Yeah but since we have the L_C_D_ , we didn't need too much button too many buttons . Um , okay , just um the decision of the power button . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Should we make it a button , or some some something which would be {disfmarker} project manager: For what ? industrial designer: Uh power button . marketing: I think a button . user interface: A button is better . project manager: Ah oh yeah , yeah . marketing: I think it should be a bu industrial designer: If it if it's a button or {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah a button , yeah I guess so . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Its own button on the front . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Okay , one nice big button . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Old fashioned button , to satisfy the grandmothers . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: Okay . project manager: So , any other suggestions or functions ? industrial designer: Mm . marketing: S What about things like the clock and um timers ? industrial designer: Do we still have the time ?

Well what w what was the question ? user interface: Clock or {disfmarker} marketing: Uh um , you know , some func some features on the control to display a time , or t to display {disfmarker} project manager: Usually it's already on T_V_ or something like that . user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Yeah but since we want to control all the televisions , and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: no ? Because if if the T_V_ turns on itself , it well you know , if the time The timer should be there . user interface: Mm . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that , and is it very useful ?

Okay . project manager: No time on {gap} . industrial designer: {gap} user interface: And uh do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands , or ? industrial designer: Yes yes . project manager: I think {disfmarker} user interface: I I thin I think it will not take lots of place , we just need a microphone and the software , so , and it sh and it will be a little bit new and interesting , so people may be attracted to buy this stuff and it's not very difficult to uh put a software inside the the electronic device and put a microphone . It doesn't take that much place and also that much {disfmarker} It doesn't cost that much . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah but we we should be careful about the battery life , then . If we use the speech recognition . project manager: {vocalsound} So maybe we think {disfmarker} we can think more about that , and discuss that maybe last time {disfmarker} next time . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: And uh yeah , now the meeting room is busy . Somebody booked the meeting room just for {disfmarker} at one P_M_ , and so we should leave . Uh . So , um . So now we are going for for a small lunch . It's uh funded by the company .
