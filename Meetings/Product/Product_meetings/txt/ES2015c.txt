project manager: Is everyone ready to start ? industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Yes . project manager: Okay . Great . Well , welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . I'll just get the PowerPoint presentation up and running . Okay . Um , on the agenda for this , um , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with um some general ideas of our design . And , um , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what uh materials we're gonna use , and that sort of thing . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: The meeting will be forty minutes long . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: Alright , and I will switch up PowerPoint . industrial designer: Thank you . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Should be just loading . {vocalsound} Okay . Oh , although I can't see it on my screen . That says go here . Okay . I've been doing some research into the different components that we could use , um what's available to us f to actually make the remote control . Um , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , and what is it happens inside the casing , which is more your field . Um , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Which is not necessarily a battery , as we're about to see . Um , there are several components of , um , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of . Um , including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip . Which is where all the main information is uh contained . Um , diodes , transistors , resonators , resistors , and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well . Um , and all their positioning in the circuit . project manager: Um {disfmarker} Are they all included , like mandatorily , or r are these different options ? industrial designer: Uh , these , they're all different options , they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: We can go into that later . Um , all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately , and work out the most , like , effective um circuit , including all the wires and everything like that . And the L_E_D_ of course , that's a light emitting diode . So , we could , so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: Okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source . We could use a basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well . And they're not so great to dispose of , environmentally . {vocalsound} There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . A bit out of date . Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed . project manager: Um {disfmarker} What is a hand-powered dynamo ? industrial designer: Um , where you manually charge up the power . project manager: Just every , every once in a while ? industrial designer: Like you wind up something . project manager: Just every once in a while or constantly ? industrial designer: Sorry ? Yeah . Every once in a while I think project manager: Alright . It'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it I think . industrial designer: . But it's {disfmarker} Yeah . It would be like going a step back in time . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: I don't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology . project manager: No . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . I mean , the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work . Um , or there's solar power , which we've been considering inside a building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful . project manager: Right . industrial designer: But , good to look into , renewable energy , always the way . Um , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat . That's got a lot to do with the ergonomics . Like how it's comfortable and s sits in the hand . We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up . Or too small . Or too slidy . I know I've had a remote control before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: 'cause it had so many buttons on , and the shape was so symmetrical that I'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Because you can't really see which way round it is . project manager: Right . industrial designer: Um , we also can choose what materials {disfmarker} um , the {disfmarker} we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti-R_S_I_ . It's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that , so it's very like soft , not so stressful on your hands . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Wood . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Um , again , stepping back in time again there . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Um , titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really . But , would've been maybe for future projects . Um right our choice for buttons as well . We've developed some {disfmarker} we've got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons . I think that was brought up for , um , {disfmarker} they're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons . You can just slide up and down . I'm sure we're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Um one thing with the scroll buttons though . It , it {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: we would have to have an L_C_D_ um industrial designer: Yeah . That's true . project manager: display , and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult . industrial designer: And that would lead to an advanced {disfmarker} yeah . If we have {disfmarker} yeah . We're going on to that later with the advanc with the L_C_D_ that means we'd need a really advanced chip . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: And it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Um , also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with . It's the most straightforward . But you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well . {gap} . Got decisions to make there . And this is what I was just saying before . Linked in the different {disfmarker} depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs . Um simple would go with the pushbutton . Um , regular you could link with the scroll button . And the advanced we'd have to go with a L_C_D_ s display . project manager: Right . industrial designer: {vocalsound} My personal preferences ? I think we could go for the kinetic energy source . I don't , I think that's quite um an advanced kind of technology . It's not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor , attractive as well . And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy , you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels . You just give it a shake . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Sounds brilliant to me . project manager: Uh . industrial designer: Rubber casing I thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with um aesthetics . Like it could be pretty much any colour we want . Um , and gives you , yeah , more flexibility there . And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: then we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no L_C_D_ , 'cause we probably can't afford that one . project manager: Yeah . Um , one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these {vocalsound} chips and diodes and delicate technology as industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: like as the exterior . This is the one thing that's protecting its innards . industrial designer: I think that would , uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing . And the rubber would just be the , what's in contact with the human . project manager: Yeah . Another thing is it might be more difficult {disfmarker} if it's a rubber exterior {gap} talking about putting on interchangeable plates . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Um , is it {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: I don't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there . Like if it was sort of like a clip-on plastic plate . It would work that way . industrial designer: Maybe if the , um , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case . user interface: W industrial designer: So , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable . user interface: Like plastic with rubber , kind of on top industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Like {disfmarker} I can't think of what . user interface: Well , there's , there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . Or like an {disfmarker} user interface: b like a Nokia it is . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something , that's just {disfmarker} it's protective as well . user interface: It's {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Like the skin ? industrial designer: It , it stops it , I mean , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something , as well , 'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily . project manager: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Alright . So maybe the {disfmarker} industrial designer: I think i maybe a mixture of both there , maybe . marketing: Okay . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber . industrial designer: And then {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Okay . project manager: Yeah . marketing: And the buttons obviously are rubber . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Okay . project manager: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: That sounds good . I , um , is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ? industrial designer: As far as I know . It should be . project manager: Okay , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: we'll just say yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Yes , just why not . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah , yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Alright . I like the kinetic energy source idea . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Um , I don't know when people will , um , be moving a remote around a lot . industrial designer: I thought that was {disfmarker} project manager: But I think that it's worth it , kinetety , kinetic um user interface: Yeah , tha marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: energy source . It could make an we could have any kind of style . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: It wouldn't be as heavy or bulky , and {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . Just for environmental reasons . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: I guess it's a bit scary 'cause it hasn't been done before . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So it seems {disfmarker} we'd have to do more research on it . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Or I dunno if you could have a battery pack . industrial designer: Like as a backup for something . user interface: Backup . Yeah . marketing: Yeah so there's there is a one battery , because most remotes use two batteries I believe . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: So , if it was running off of one battery as a {disfmarker} user interface: That would be good yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . Some alternative just in case something went wrong . marketing: Right . user interface: Maybe we could {disfmarker} you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors , but a lot of calculators , yeah , have solar power . industrial designer: That's true . I just thought of that {gap} . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . user interface: So maybe that could be incorporated as {disfmarker} industrial designer: May maybe that could be the backup . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Instead of a battery . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Like solar backup . marketing: Although it needs some light , doesn't it ? industrial designer: Yeah . I suppose project manager: Yeah , you can watch a T_V_ in the dark then . user interface: Do , do those calculators {disfmarker} industrial designer: s but some {disfmarker} marketing: So , if we're doing {disfmarker} user interface: yeah . marketing: yeah . If we're {disfmarker} industrial designer: But thing is , it's not {disfmarker} you don't need the solar all the time . user interface: I don't know how it works . industrial designer: It can be stored . It can be like {disfmarker} you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: It just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Like a few hours a day . {gap} . project manager: I think that might be a little impractical though . marketing: Yeah . I think sometimes it's just shoved under , under a cushion , project manager: Yeah . marketing: and {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: That's true . It could easily {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Like people don't wanna have to worry about that . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: I suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think , oh no , I forgot to charge my remote today . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Like if the kinetic thing , I think what's best about that is that it's instant energy . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: You don't have to , you know , you can shake it a few times , or whatever . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: And it works . project manager: Or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it . industrial designer: Yeah . Instead of you don't have to like make sure it's in the right place to charge and {gap} . user interface: Yeah , I suppose . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Alright . Cool . industrial designer: K okay . project manager: 'S that the end of your presentation . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Alright . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Thank you . industrial designer: There we go . user interface: Thanks . Oh . {vocalsound} It's not on my screen . industrial designer: {gap} it wasn't on mine either . user interface: Why ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: I don't know why . I think , I just , I just used the mouse on there . user interface: You don't know why ? Oh okay . Is it that one ? project manager: Yeah . That's um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Um , I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now . Uh , first of all I'll explain what a user interface is . It's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived , for example , heard or felt maybe , or {vocalsound} by the human user . And it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data . Um , there are two types of user interfaces . There's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control . So that's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about . project manager: Oh . Okay . Yeah . user interface: Yeah . I'm not really sure about the pictures that {disfmarker} maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen . industrial designer: Mm . user interface: Or maybe it's the the buttons or pictures or something . {vocalsound} project manager: Hmm . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Do you think it's {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , 'cause {disfmarker} industrial designer: So I suppose sometime {disfmarker} project manager: I'm sorry ? industrial designer: after you . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Um , because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard , so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard . You're pressing the numbers for , um , for what you want . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: Mm . user interface: So you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics . industrial designer: {vocalsound} I s I suppose where um mm on some buttons you would have {disfmarker} like the power would be s some kind of symbol . user interface: Like an L_C_D_ screen . industrial designer: And if you wanted to go onto teletext or , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: I know we're not having that , but I mean a similar thing , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: you , they have {disfmarker} there's a like little picture with a screen with lines across it , which {disfmarker} I suppose it's that sort of thing like the , the symbol on the button . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: But if we're having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably won't have to focus so much on that . project manager: Yeah , we'll be doing {disfmarker} industrial designer: It'll be more the on the numbers and the volume . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . It'd be more a command interface , and then {disfmarker} industrial designer: I suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume , display , and stuff like that . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: So it's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect ? industrial designer: I {disfmarker} marketing: The infrared is like , that's considered a {disfmarker} project manager: Hmm ? user interface: No I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that's on the buttons of the remote control , and per marketing: Okay . So when it says pointing device that doesn't include {disfmarker} industrial designer: For inp user interface: Well it could be a wee scroller thing , and something could come up on the screen . project manager: Yeah . I think they're talking about L_C_D_ type things . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Okay . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Okay . project manager: Yeah . user interface: But um I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway , project manager: Yeah . user interface: to make it more simplistic . But the , we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points , marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: as in {disfmarker} just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe . {vocalsound} project manager: What do you mean ? user interface: Like {vocalsound} I can't think of an example , but {disfmarker} Sort of like little pictures rather than {disfmarker} project manager: Oh yeah , like how the buttons {disfmarker} user interface: Like a little sound . Instead of saying volume , like a little speaker or something . project manager: Yeah , as a button though . user interface: Yeah , something y marketing: Mm . project manager: So , it's a keyboard in the shape of it , right ? user interface: Yeah m perha yeah . Yeah . Maybe . project manager: Okay . Yeah . I like that idea . user interface: Um , the co uh {disfmarker} we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control . As it would be less complicated , and the controls would be more user-friendly . Um , the remote control would be cheaper to design , so that we'd have more money in the budget to , um , target the design area of the interface . You know , make it more trendy and original . We'll have more money if we keep it simple . project manager: Yeah . I'm sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget . A bit more too , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . Seeing as it's quite a new technology . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We , we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our , um , more user-friendly remote control , that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons , that , um , that their functions , colours and forms aren't always helpful . industrial designer: Yeah . That's true . That's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: It can be a bit , yeah , overwhelming . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . And that all interfaces are different . So , um , that doesn't improve the use of the produ product , so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand . And maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yep . user interface: Does anyone have any questions ? project manager: Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it a simplistic look . user interface: Mm . marketing: I think if we go with the um design plate thing , we'll have to . Just because of colour clashing , project manager: Yeah . marketing: and if we wanted to , project manager: Yeah . marketing: so and , and we might , I mean , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons . user interface: But um {disfmarker} project manager: But what about the lighting up effect ? marketing: You mean different colours for the lighting or {disfmarker} project manager: Um , well , um , I thought we had um decided that we would {disfmarker} if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up . And so if they were black , it wouldn't be possible for them to light up . marketing: Mm-hmm . Oh I see what you're saying . project manager: If they were white they would glow , probably . marketing: Well y project manager: If they were made out of rubber . marketing: Oh so you're picturing the light is coming from the back . I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards . industrial designer: Oh . project manager: Oh . marketing: But , but I guess , you mean from the back . project manager: Where would the light come from ? marketing: Okay . industrial designer: I'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through . marketing: Okay . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something . project manager: Yeah , marketing: Right . project manager: and well rubber is a more translucent product too , industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . project manager: so we have that taken care of . industrial designer: It should be able to {disfmarker} marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: mm-hmm . user interface: In the phone that I was thinking of as well , when you change the um covers of it , the , the little buttons that actually , you know , that contro control stuff , are behind the rubber . industrial designer: Li yeah . user interface: So you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces . Do you know what I mean ? marketing: {vocalsound} Oh . project manager: Oh . user interface: 'Cause it's just the wee control , marketing: Yeah . They , they insert over . user interface: yeah , thing that's behind it . marketing: Okay . project manager: Mm . user interface: So {disfmarker} I mean , we don't have to decide on one colour . Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe ? industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Well , if they're raised up buttons . So that you can feel them . user interface: Yeah . project manager: We were talking about it being more um , a lot more tangible . marketing: T project manager: Um , it might be more difficult to do . If they're , if they're sticking up . user interface: Yeah . project manager: If it's flat then , like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone , it's like all very flat , and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons , but {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: I think it would be possible . I don't think it would make that much difference . I mean , the uh the dimensions of it . 'Cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone . You can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons . And then you get to the circuit . I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing . I'm sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing , without causing too much difficulty . project manager: Yeah . Okay . industrial designer: I'm sure that'd be fine . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Alright . If it's do-able we can do . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , sounds good to me . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: So that's everything , then ? industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Alright , thank you . marketing: Okay is that my turn then ? project manager: That means you're up . Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Alright . {vocalsound} I have a shorter report for you today . Um , it took a while to get this , uh {disfmarker} Uh . industrial designer: You're not plugged in yet . marketing: {vocalsound} Oh . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: That's a very good point . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay , so um , this report is about uh trend-watching . Um , basically so we can live up to our , our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control . Sorry . There we go . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So , just so you know , my method was mainly web web-based research this time around . I also spoke with fashion experts in Milan , New York and Paris . And I looked at the design reports from previous years , here at Real Remote . Um , just so c we can work off of them , see how fashions have changed . Um , {vocalsound} so I'll list the three most important aspects that I've come across . Um , and they , they're each more important than the one that comes after it . Uh , the first one is that there should be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look-and-feel . Um , this should be our priority , as we've been saying . The second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative . So , I think we've done a lot of talking about that , just with lighting and the buttons and the {disfmarker} face-plates . Um , so it looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that . And the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use . {vocalsound} So , pretty basic there . And the recent fashion update , uh , according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . {vocalsound} Um , also , in contra uh in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy . Again , we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons . Um {disfmarker} So , my personal preferences here , um of course , as {disfmarker} we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting , and I'd like to stick to that . The fruits and vegetable themes , I don't know if that's going to work for us . It sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: I don't know if we wanna do it on remotes . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: It could be one of the options . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen . Um , the temporary light-up idea , sounds like we're gonna stick to that . And then , uh , tying in a trendy look with user-friendliness . project manager: Yeah . Yeah , it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring . Everything else we can really , we can really industrial designer: It is strange . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: um , do , according to our plans already , given the market . But fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's , it's a little {gap} but it , it's everywhere . industrial designer: Well {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: So maybe we {disfmarker} I've seen a lot of purses with olives on them , you know . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . marketing: But I I think , I think if we stick to T_V_ based , you know , maybe T_V_ shows , or {disfmarker} project manager: But they still need to um fit into people's decor though . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Or colour schemes . industrial designer: We {disfmarker} I think we possibly could take a more abstract design . marketing: Right . industrial designer: Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables . And then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes . I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Or a strawberry seed or a leaf . user interface: Yeah , yeah . marketing: The {disfmarker} The essence of strawberry . Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Or just like you know really make it a quite abstract , if that's fits in more with what we're doing . Instead of fruits and vegetables , user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: just {disfmarker} if you look at it straightforward , it's a bit {disfmarker} yeah . It doesn't s quite fit in with the trendy {disfmarker} well , obviously it does , if that's the current theme . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: But {vocalsound} may maybe we could go more directly , I don't know . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: But initially , I dunno . I think if we just sort of tone it down a bit . project manager: Tone it down . Yeah , industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah and like not , not {disfmarker} marketing: I guess , yeah . project manager: like more like photos of fruit , on , on our product . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: yeah . user interface: Or banana-shaped . {vocalsound} marketing: One thing I was thinking though is {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: So maybe there could be animal-based , you know . Because a lot of people have a house cat . Or , or a dog . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Um , that might be getting , you know , too specific , and we should see what the success of the first face-plates are . But it's something to keep in mind . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: {vocalsound} And , did you have any questions ? Pretty straightforward ? project manager: Yeah um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Okay . project manager: Alright , given that information , we need to start making some more specific decisions . So I'll need to um hook up the PowerPoint again . marketing: There you go . {vocalsound} Have you guys been saving your PowerPoint presentations to the {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} I didn't for the first one . But I have now . marketing: okay . project manager: But it's still around right ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Uh , hopefully project manager: Okay . user interface: Where do you have to save it to ? industrial designer: . Project documents I think . user interface: Okay . project manager: Okay . I'm just trying to make this pop up now . Alright . Here we go . Okay so we have to uh decide now exactly what we are going to do . So energy , we {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . project manager: oh . Oh no I can't write it in when it's in this setting . industrial designer: 'Kay . project manager: Does anyone know how to take it out of {disfmarker} Um , user interface: Just escape I think . marketing: The PowerPoint ? project manager: yeah . Yeah . Okay . Um , so back to decisions . Energy , we've decided on kinetic , right ? industrial designer: Kinetic yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so that's good . industrial designer: Are we going to have a backup ? project manager: Hmm . industrial designer: Or do we just {disfmarker} project manager: But would a backup really be necessary ? I mean will people just use the battery if there's no , if there's , industrial designer: I think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy , project manager: if there is backup . industrial designer: and be bold and innovative , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: and hope this works , and well hope that it works . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: I think {disfmarker} project manager: There's like no reason why it wouldn't work , right ? industrial designer: yeah . I think {disfmarker} no . I , I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential . marketing: So {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . It could even be one of our selling points . industrial designer: Go for it . It could be {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: fully kinetic energy . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Environmentally conscious or something . industrial designer: Is everyone happy with that ? marketing: So if it's not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Hope so . {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . project manager: Alright , the next um decision is chip on print . I don't exactly know what that means . industrial designer: Um , it was whether we went for the simple , the regular , or the advanced chip . And that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have , so {disfmarker} project manager: Right , and we were going for more simplistic style , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , it was {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: so that was without the L_C_D_ . So that means we're not doing the advanced . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: So it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons . project manager: I think we decided on the pushbuttons , right ? industrial designer: Uh , so that's the simple . user interface: Yeah . I don project manager: Yeah . user interface: yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting , the interior lighting system ? industrial designer: Yeah possibly . project manager: Yeah ? industrial designer: So , it's probably gonna be the regular chip that we're going to need . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: So it's a medium . project manager: That's called medium , or regular ? industrial designer: So regular chip . Regular sorry . {vocalsound} project manager: 'Kay . industrial designer: Regular chip . marketing: Oh , is regular not simple ? industrial designer: Lighting . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah if we {disfmarker} user interface: It's for the lighting , yeah . industrial designer: because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well . marketing: Right right right . project manager: Okay , and cases . Um , does this , is this dependent on shape , or what it's made of , or what ? industrial designer: So th I think this is just like gonna be the {disfmarker} a very outer case , which we will decide on rubber . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . Well , I guess plastic and coated in rubber . industrial designer: Rubber . user interface: Yeah {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Plastic with rubber industrial designer: Plastic rubber coat . user interface: plastic coat . project manager: coating and interchangeable um industrial designer: Interchangeable , yeah . Still going for that . project manager: yeah , interchangeable plates . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay . User interface concept . This is your time to shine . user interface: We decided on the component . I , I I'm sorry , I've lost my um {vocalsound} PowerPoint thing , so I can't remember what it's ca it's the component {disfmarker} industrial designer: Your screen ? marketing: Think it was called command interface . industrial designer: Was it {disfmarker} project manager: Oh , yeah . Yeah . marketing: Command interface , {gap} . user interface: The command inter project manager: Command interface . industrial designer: Ouch . user interface: The command line interface yeah . project manager: Did you say command line ? Okay . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Line interface . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Alright , and supplements . What's that all about ? user interface: Um , I think that is {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: well we haven't really made any decisions about what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the {disfmarker} in consistent use . Like what what are ideas to combat these problems ? project manager: Um {disfmarker} user interface: You know how um different interfaces are very different , and can be confusing because because of their difference , and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: We haven't really decided what to do about that . project manager: Um , what are our choices here ? user interface: {vocalsound} Well it's just um w where where shall we locate the buttons . What kind of functions wi shall we have ? project manager: You mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels , and we'll have the channel-changer , and volume , and power ? industrial designer: The power . Volume . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Um {disfmarker} user interface: So pretty {disfmarker} just just the basic button functions . project manager: Yeah . Like I don't know if we should go into like adjusting light levels , things like that , because different televisions will have {disfmarker} industrial designer: May yeah . project manager: Um , yeah . industrial designer: Tone , contrast , and things . That's a bit {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} That was on , um one of my presentations . About how often it was used . project manager: Yep . industrial designer: Yeah , it was minima marketing: Do you remember that ? industrial designer: well , it wasn't the l project manager: Yeah , it was hardly ever used really . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} I w {vocalsound} Should I bring it up ? project manager: Yeah . And most televisions will come with a remote . industrial designer: Yeah . That would be good . Yeah , and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television , user interface: Yeah , each television . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: so {disfmarker} project manager: 'Kay , well we know we want numbers . marketing: The ch t Screen settings was used um zero point five times an hour . So tw twice every {disfmarker} once every two hours . Um , and it was considered a one point five relevance , on a scale of ten . That's brightness , colour , tone , all that . industrial designer: Mm . I think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself , user interface: You don't change that often , yeah . industrial designer: doesn't it ? I'm sure it has its own buttons , so you don't necessarily need to have it on remote . project manager: Yeah , it does . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yeah , and different televisions . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Like we , I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: changes like that . industrial designer: So we're just going for power , channels , volume , project manager: Volume . marketing: The other one was audio settings . Mono , stereo , pitch . I mean I sometimes use that . Some T_V_s will have the option of like living room style , movie style , um {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: and that , they say that's used zero point eight times an hour , which is actually somewhat high . Like almost once an hour . industrial designer: Mm . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Um , relevance of two . project manager: Oh . We have five minutes to finish our meeting . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Crap . Okay , um , let's do this fast . Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Well that didn't some up on mine . project manager: Should we have audio ? It only comes up on mine usually . user interface: It w {vocalsound} it would seem silly if we'd {gap} having anything else , just have an audio button though . marketing: Oh . project manager: Yeah , user interface: Do you know ? project manager: I don't , I {disfmarker} it's , it's a problem with the international uh appeal , I think . Um , if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work . But we know that everyone has this and it's the same . user interface: But we {disfmarker} industrial designer: I've {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah I guess that it affects the marketing , 'cause it , {vocalsound} mm it is a good sales ploy to say , aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons . user interface: Yeah . marketing: This one has channel , volume and your channe and your power . industrial designer: Yeah , that's it . We can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic . user interface: That could be a sales pitch . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Simple and {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah uh I {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . project manager: Alright . industrial designer: brilliant . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Good . And , okay , in closing , 'cause we only have five minutes . We'll be meeting again in thirty minutes . Um , you'll be working , Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design . Wait a minute . Is that right ? industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yep , and um the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in . And you'll be evaluating the product . Um , Poppy and Tara will have to work together , using modelling clay . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: And , um , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Alright . So , anyone else have something to say ? industrial designer: Um , I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Are we {disfmarker} seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research , I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something , because even if that may not seem obvious to us , if that's what the surveys brought out , I think that we should probably go along with that . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: Um , so I suppose that'll come out in our dev design development . But you're happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg ? marketing: Now do you guys need {disfmarker} want an idea of how many uh {disfmarker} are you gonna come up with casing ideas ? industrial designer: Y Yeah . marketing: Like f five different {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: {gap} five . {gap} . user interface: What I {disfmarker} What I was thinking {disfmarker} what do yous think of this ? Um , having the numbers kind of like , not a bunch of grapes , but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Like grapes . Like that's kind of fruity or something . marketing: Yeah you can have some fun with the buttons , it's true . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: That's just {disfmarker} industrial designer: We can have a look at those ideas , yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . marketing: I guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So it's a something that will , you know , appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds . Something that your granny would want on her remote control . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Um , and international tastes as well , so {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Tricky . {vocalsound} A lot of things to consider . Hm . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Not easy . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . Lots of {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: yeah . Alright . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: 'Kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Alright . And , um , we'll reconvene in thirty minutes . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: 'Kay . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Okay . project manager: Bye . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: Thank you . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} I'll see you later . {vocalsound} Oh , what did I just do . Okay .
