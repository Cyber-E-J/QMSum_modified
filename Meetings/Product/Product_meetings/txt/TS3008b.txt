user interface: Here we go again . industrial designer: {vocalsound} My mouse is not working anymore . user interface: {vocalsound} Oh . industrial designer: {vocalsound} He's uh {disfmarker} marketing: Oh . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: when I put it in , is is going to beep beep beep . marketing: Oh , I got a nice little screen here over here . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} I got like this big black border uh on every side . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . user interface: Mm , okay . project manager: Everybody ready ? marketing: {vocalsound} I'll I'll fix it . user interface: Yeah , it's okay . project manager: Welcome at the functional design meeting , again presented by Maarten . marketing: Yeah , whatever . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh this is the agenda , the opening . Uh , we've got three presentations . And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me . And we're gonna make a decision on the remote control functions . We have uh forty minutes . marketing: Yes . project manager: Oh , well this is the {vocalsound} the closing already . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: So uh {disfmarker} well we start off with the th the first presentation then . Uh , I think um in uh {disfmarker} we have to do it in uh in right order . user interface: Okay . project manager: Maybe the {disfmarker} marketing: I don't know what the right order is . So {disfmarker} project manager: Well , it {disfmarker} user interface: No . industrial designer: Huh . project manager: Oh that . It won't {disfmarker} doesn't {disfmarker} Maybe we should start with the the technical functions . industrial designer: Okay , project manager: Yeah ? industrial designer: how can I get this on the whiteboard ? project manager: Well it's you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder . user interface: In project . industrial designer: Okay , I've done that . project manager: You've already done that ? user interface: No can that open . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Well let's close this one . We'll just uh open a new one . user interface: Open it there . project manager: Uh , well . Yes . Uh-oh . New thing . Oh yeah , uh I have to say something . Uh , due to some uh technical problems I haven't uh digitized the last uh the meeting minutes . But I'll uh make sure that uh happens next time . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Okay . {vocalsound} About the get {disfmarker} project manager: And I'll get this one uh in digital uh form too . industrial designer: 'Kay , we're going to um uh talk about working design . Um , the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy , it activates a chip uh in the remote . It's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television . Mm , it's a nowadays very uh known , a known uh uh technology . Um , the known technology can make a cost very low . Uh , it's a wild uh {disfmarker} a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world . And and the components are very uh very cheap . Um , Uh , diodes , uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights , they're needed and they're uh everywhere available . Uh , again , it's a fair price . It's a common uh technology uh , like I told um {disfmarker} Uh , the circuit board , it's the most um important uh um part of the remote control . Uh , we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires , it's {disfmarker} it is uh {disfmarker} can be made as fast as printing paper . It's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it's all very uh {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah , they're making it uh all the time . Uh , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: and it's not uh very specialised uh technology . {vocalsound} I haven't come to here , but um I've got uh some uh images of uh remote controls . They were not uh very uh trendy or just uh just a remote control like everyone knows . So I don't know uh why I should put it here . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . But it's the technical side of the remote control . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yes , but uh I uh haven't made it because uh of the time . project manager: Oh . Okay . Well , we'll we'll have to skip that part then . industrial designer: {vocalsound} What ? user interface: Okay . project manager: But you don't think it's a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control ? It's gonna be easy ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} No . Yes . project manager: Okay . user interface: But nothing restricted for user interface ? project manager: Yeah . M user interface: With technical {disfmarker} industrial designer: Um , no , it's uh it's just a part of uh a known technology , yeah . user interface: I don't know . project manager: Okay . user interface: 'Kay . industrial designer: Remote control is nothing special nowadays . project manager: R regardless of what type of functions we want to implement . Doesn't really matter . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Um {disfmarker} user interface: But I kind of uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: I don't think so , project manager: Okay . Yeah , {gap} okay . industrial designer: because of the {disfmarker} all the televisions uh {disfmarker} there are a few {disfmarker} maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions , user interface: Yes . Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . industrial designer: but is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote ? project manager: Well , we'll see . We'll see later on . user interface: Well , the technical functions . Um , well I don't know if you got the same uh pictures as I got , project manager: No . user interface: but uh I got these two , industrial designer: No . user interface: and I think they're {disfmarker} we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user . {vocalsound} th I think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements , I don't s uh know who's doing t project manager: Well , uh will there be some uh user requirements later on ? {vocalsound} The ones I {disfmarker} I've uh received from the account manager . user interface: Yeah , but it {disfmarker} I think that's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control . project manager: Yeah . Well , we'll keep this in mind , and then discuss it later on . user interface: Yeah , well y we can put functions in it when uh {disfmarker} yeah , when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it . project manager: Uh-huh . Okay , but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote . {gap} we should we should choose one uh {disfmarker} we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v marketing: Yes , I agree . Yeah . project manager: Yeah ? Well , what {disfmarker} that's what you want {disfmarker} trying to say . user interface: Well , yeah w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , uh like elderly people and {disfmarker} we have to choose for novice user . project manager: Okay . Okay . user interface: But I don't know . It's it's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use . project manager: Yeah , well {vocalsound} some of these {disfmarker} Uh , yeah . Well , some of that will {disfmarker} Yeah , but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements . user interface: Yeah , probably , yeah . marketing: Yes . project manager: So {disfmarker} user interface: Uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions , uh like just th the channels uh one till nine , uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that . Um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . I think that's just basic what we need . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: And from that on we can {gap} user requirements what we need more . Uh {disfmarker} Yeah , I just um um I thought Joost was looking at the trendy {disfmarker} the trends in the markets , and I don't know if there uh are any um {disfmarker} uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that . marketing: Yes . user interface: M you can just {vocalsound} you can k {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} I haven't really found a conclusion like that . user interface: you can keep it in mind that . marketing: Yeah . user interface: I don't know . Uh , I th I thought the the {disfmarker} with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh {disfmarker} marketing: Design . user interface: yeah , more trendier design , I think . I think . marketing: Sounds interesting . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah ? marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Uh , well , that's all I have to say , I think . project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah , that was it . marketing: {vocalsound} Alright . project manager: Well , then the Marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market . marketing: {vocalsound} Yes . user interface: {gap} . marketing: Yeah . It's alright . Um {disfmarker} Alright , I've done some research for functional requirements . Um {disfmarker} yes . The working method um {vocalsound} there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . Uh , I've lined them up here . Uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that . I uh have found some interesting things . We do we do got a market . Um , {vocalsound} three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . Um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as I uh quoted here from the uh results . {vocalsound} Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . That's quite a lot . Um , {vocalsound} relevant options are , of course , power buttons . Although , only used once per hour . Uh , channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more um , yeah , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used . Furthermore , fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . That doesn't say we got {disfmarker} we can leave ninety percent off . But it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated . Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . And um {vocalsound} an important thing here , the most important customers uh , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . And uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls . So , {vocalsound} what I was thinking {disfmarker} oh , wrong side . We shouldn't implement too much features on uh on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . Group features for a higher usability , uh what I was claiming in the previous meeting . Um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it uh {disfmarker} there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh {disfmarker} yeah , how do you say , we can spare at buttons over there . project manager: Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} And um , if you want to implement V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options , group them in the button , not too uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . Small buttons , so they won't be very um , how do you say {disfmarker} project manager: Visually presents . marketing: Yes , won't be very present , thank you . And a trendy look , well uh , although seventy percent of the market is uh {disfmarker} consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever , I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent . That was kind of what I found . project manager: Okay . user interface: Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: Well , then we {disfmarker} I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on uh what features we find important . marketing: {vocalsound} Yes . project manager: Uh , well some of the uh new requirements {vocalsound} make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant , I think . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Because um uh s decided to put {disfmarker} They have decide to put two additional requirements forward . Well , now I see four . marketing: Two ? {vocalsound} project manager: That's kinda strange . Well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . Well , I think that may be so , but well , we can't just leave the teletext button off . user interface: Well {disfmarker} project manager: It's impossible , I think . user interface: No way . marketing: {vocalsound} No uh , I agree , I agree . project manager: So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and don't make a lot of special {disfmarker} put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or {disfmarker} marketing: Not too much , no . project manager: You know , it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So we have to think of that . The remote control should only be used for television . Otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . So maybe we should leave all D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ related features off completely . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: I don't know . I think that uh that's what they're trying to say . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . So you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: But , well , they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} I don't really agree actually , to be honest . It's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty . It's only like thirty percent of the total market . project manager: Yeah , but it is {disfmarker} it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about , we already cover that . marketing: Mayb yeah ? project manager: Our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we we also want , {vocalsound} you know , a new customer group . That's the one we haven't covered yet . So I think that's what the problem is . We haven't got remote controls for uh {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: Well I think , yeah . marketing: Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit . project manager: Yeah , I think so . Maybe if it's {disfmarker} marketing: Not too much then , bu alright . project manager: no no , but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either . marketing: Yes . project manager: Uh , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . Okay , {vocalsound} something else nice to know . user interface: But what's our slogan ? project manager: Sorry ? Yeah , {vocalsound} you will have to look that up . {vocalsound} user interface: The slogan uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , I'll have a look . project manager: {vocalsound} I think it's something about the {disfmarker} user interface: Puts fashion in electronics . {vocalsound} marketing: We put the fashion in electronics . project manager: Oh , okay . {vocalsound} I thought it w might be , let's make things better or something , but {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Sense simplicity . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Sense and simplicity . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay well , {vocalsound} let's go back to the the agenda . So we've now had to {disfmarker} the three presentations . We know about the new project requirements . That means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions . Well , if I can uh make a start , I think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be , and I already talked about the {disfmarker} maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it . I think we're we're looking for some {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions . Y well , that {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Well , to be honest , if um our uh aim group is uh till forty , not older than forty , maybe that's not very uh {disfmarker} yeah , we don't really need to have a simple remote control . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: I think we can implement more functions then , because um {vocalsound} basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology user interface: Yeah , but wha project manager: Yeah , yeah . marketing: and therefore will be a more {disfmarker} project manager: M yeah , that's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me , I think they are are c are contradicting each other , user interface: But {disfmarker} project manager: because they want a simpler design , and no uh other uh s functions than just T_V_ , but they s do aim at a younger {disfmarker} marketing: Yes . {vocalsound} project manager: Well , ma user interface: Yeah , but you sai you said that that a lot of functions aren't used . marketing: Yeah . user interface: So why should j we put this function in ? marketing: {vocalsound} Well , I think {disfmarker} user interface: I think more {disfmarker} I think uh people {disfmarker} younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: But I think uh you {disfmarker} we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the , know , th th in functions you have {disfmarker} Y Well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room , like a t T_V_ and a D_V_D_ player . marketing: Yes . project manager: You can uh , know , you {gap} you can {vocalsound} make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the T_V_ set on your remote control uh with the with uh the , you know , audio settings and uh v uh screen settings . We don't want that . I think that was {disfmarker} that became clear . We don't want . But w maybe we should put some func uh , I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to , you know , they want to uh marketing: Yeah , control . user interface: Yeah , but uh you said {disfmarker} project manager: control , remotely . user interface: Yeah , d yeah , but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: No , yeah , th th the user requirements of the the {disfmarker} The new project requirements told us not to {disfmarker} user interface: It's n Yeah . project manager: But maybe w Yeah . I think we maybe should {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , well we should uh put some functions for other {disfmarker} maybe for other equipment on it . But just the basic functions . Maybe like rewind and wind , marketing: {gap} project manager: or n what d what do you guys think ? industrial designer: But you can put them under the same button . marketing: Not much more than that . project manager: Yeah , if {disfmarker} as far as possible . marketing: Yep . Or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever . project manager: But what do you think ? marketing: So t project manager: Do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that {disfmarker} to control other devices ? user interface: No . project manager: No , you don't think so ? marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: No , new requirements say no . project manager: Yeah , the new requirements say so . user interface: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: But you can put a play and stop and and rewind . project manager: Well , maybe it's {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control . user interface: Yeah , but {disfmarker} project manager: You know , a lot of D_V_D_ players have some tricky settings with {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes , but we {disfmarker} user interface: I i if it's too simple uh th they won't use the remote control , they use their own th th {vocalsound} with lot more functions . marketing: Y yes . project manager: {vocalsound} Yep , exactly . That's that's wha marketing: But but for for example , V_C_R_ , that's better example in this case . I think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme uh the V_C_R_ to start recording at three P_M_ or whatever , project manager: No no , you don't {vocalsound} {disfmarker} No no , you don't need it . No , no . user interface: No , no . Exactly . industrial designer: Huh . marketing: just play , stop , rewind and uh fast forward . project manager: Okay , but we have to think uh {disfmarker} w we have to think D_V_D_ I th uh , I guess , marketing: Yeah , I know , but uh {disfmarker} project manager: so um but uh from my experience it's kinda {vocalsound} a lot of D_V_D_ players , you know , like forwarding , goes differently . Uh , you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed . It's c sometimes a bit difficult . user interface: Mm , yeah . project manager: Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh {disfmarker} Well , I was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , I think we m should focus on the T_V_ then . marketing: {vocalsound} Yes . user interface: Yeah , but just {disfmarker} {vocalsound} keep it simple and look more at th project manager: And uh and it's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one . If you want to keep it simple , you can make a universal remote . user interface: No . It's only for television . So {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . It's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table , industrial designer: Yes , but there are there are {disfmarker} project manager: and it's just for when you you you jump on the couch , you pick up the the the nice remote , the simple one , just to put on the television , nothing more . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , nothing more . Exactly . project manager: Okay . marketing: Alright . project manager: Um , but what televis industrial designer: But how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ? There are uh a dozen of uh {disfmarker} dozens of of remote controls that have {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , we we'll make w this one trendy . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} And simple . user interface: {vocalsound} The user interface is easy . project manager: Well , we we will come to that , but ju first on the on the functions . So we should put uh zap buttons on it . Um , also numbers , to uh to go to the specific channels . user interface: And the basic {disfmarker} yeah , basic functions , yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Yes , definitely , yeah . project manager: Uh , user interface: It's too much integrated in the other . project manager: Okay , a t a teletext button should be there . But just one big teletext button , on and off . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Probably . marketing: Yeah , and maybe two or three other options , but not {disfmarker} nothing more than that . I think stop function is very useful . If you have a uh a page which consists of more pages , and you are not a very quick reader , project manager: Oh , okay . marketing: then I think it's very irritating if the next page shows up , but {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , but uh I think that becomes too difficult , it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then . marketing: {vocalsound} Well , I use it very regularly , the action . I re I use it {vocalsound} quite often . project manager: Yeah , yeah , but maybe you s yeah yeah , maybe y you do , but I've never heard of it in the first place . And user interface: Will you look {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: we have to {disfmarker} well t yeah , and t and teletext is becoming outdated . user interface: Look at the market . project manager: We just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably . Yeah . I don't know . I think that that's kin getting too complex for our remote . user interface: Well {disfmarker} project manager: I don't know what you th guys think . marketing: Might be . Might be . user interface: Yeah , I {disfmarker} uh , it's {gap} {disfmarker} {gap} Sunday I always use it for the uh yeah , for the soccer uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , but do you like to have a {disfmarker} such a s stop button ? Or do you think it uh {disfmarker} I think it's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function . user interface: Well , uh when you uh uh {disfmarker} when you look uh {disfmarker} for example um , a couple of weeks ago I looked at the {disfmarker} for the flights , and there are a lot of flights in one page , so if if th project manager: Yeah . Okay , it goes {disfmarker} Yeah , but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now . That's why {vocalsound} it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements . industrial designer: Yes , but you could put user interface: Yeah , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages . project manager: Well yeah uh , industrial designer: If you have seven pages , you can go up and down . project manager: lots of new televisions can store pages , you know , and then you can just skip manually through them using {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes . project manager: I think we should just put one teletext button on it . user interface: True . project manager: Then we meet uh the new requirements . we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re we have to choose for the the simple design , I guess . user interface: A simple {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: Okay . Um , well , what functions do we have to decide on ? Or do we {disfmarker} uh I dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want . We have the zap and uh the volume . Should we do m make them very big ? The the the zap button . D d industrial designer: Yes . marketing: I think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present , project manager: Th that's that's that's considered to be trendy also . user interface: But trendy , yeah . marketing: yep . project manager: Or maybe you should place them on a {disfmarker} uh , in a special way ? user interface: I don't know . industrial designer: Maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick . project manager: Yeah , something or uh {vocalsound} somethin special way to to zap through the {disfmarker} it has to {vocalsound} s it has to be {vocalsound} {disfmarker} yeah , and quick . You have to use it very quickly . user interface: Original . It was uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yep . user interface: True . marketing: {vocalsound} If you grab the remote , your hands should be on top of the plus . project manager: Yeah , and it {disfmarker} the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid {disfmarker} at a rapid pace . marketing: Yes . project manager: Oh , what should we decide on then ? I think in a in a case of this simple remote control , the technical aspects which uh weren't worked out already , but it w shouldn't be a problem then . industrial designer: But {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: No , it's o just signals uh {disfmarker} and the television d uh does the rest . project manager: Yep . user interface: Maybe uh {disfmarker} project manager: No , okay , but we don't have to {disfmarker} uh , when we don't want to uh control other devices , I think it makes it even more simple . industrial designer: No . user interface: Uh maybe we {disfmarker} uh uh the batteries maybe . If you use large batteries or small batter batteries . project manager: I think industrial designer: The most standard batteries . project manager: I think that we should use uh d user interface: Yeah ? {vocalsound} marketing: I think double A_ . project manager: yeah , not not uh the b the watch kind marketing: Yep . project manager: {gap} {disfmarker} th the most uh {disfmarker} Well , it has to be simple , and I wi user interface: Yeah . marketing: The most ordinary uh batteries . project manager: Which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house , you know . user interface: Okay . marketing: Yep . project manager: Oh . How much time do we ha we have left uh ? M m m more than thirty minutes ? marketing: {vocalsound} I think about twenty minutes . project manager: Uh ten twenty minutes . {vocalsound} Well , uh these these shouldn't {disfmarker} user interface: Early break . industrial designer: But i in a way we have to be uh uh special . project manager: Yeah . Yeah , okay . But that's that's {disfmarker} Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? How we can {disfmarker} what the extra touch can be . Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or {disfmarker} industrial designer: Maybe th m project manager: Well , it was something about how we lose them . Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing . marketing: {vocalsound} I think that's n that's more for a for an age range or uh {vocalsound} ten to twelve or whatever . {vocalsound} user interface: To find him . That's maybe {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} I don't know . I don't know . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Nah , um a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things . It w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone , and it is i {gap} has something nice . marketing: Yeah , yeah , that's good one , yep . project manager: Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it , user interface: Yeah . project manager: or maybe it should {vocalsound} {disfmarker} or an {disfmarker} or the like the the can opener . Maybe it contains some feature that you don't normally link to a remote control . I think it's very impor because we're gonna make such a basic remote control , we have to do something to make it special . user interface: Yeah . project manager: It's gonna cost twenty five Euros . marketing: {vocalsound} Ye I think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually , because television and beer is not a rare combination . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , but the {disfmarker} well , it's already been done . user interface: Yeah , but that's {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: Nah . {vocalsound} Yeah , that's true . But {disfmarker} and I think it's gonna be uh very uh {disfmarker} it has to be sturdy or something , so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something . marketing: Yes . project manager: {gap} it has to be used something special , user interface: Yeah . project manager: and you really {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it has to , marketing: Yep . project manager: you know y not s people , when they buy it , they have to think , well this one lasts for a long time . We're really gonna use them . Not some thing you you throw away next week , you know . marketing: No , that's true . project manager: So maybe uh that's i I think that's {vocalsound} when uh when we decide on these type of functions , know , basic functions , uh it's very important to find something like this . So there's a very important task for you . And maybe we can all think about it . user interface: Be original , yeah . project manager: Uh , also for you maybe , when t you {disfmarker} it's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy , and and uh and al as in a friend {disfmarker} use friendly as well , you know . user interface: Mm-hmm . And use friendly , yeah . project manager: So big buttons , flashy design , and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh-huh . user interface: Must brain-storm . marketing: Yeah , a swapable front or whatever . project manager: Yeah , or just different colours would be uh {disfmarker} I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control . user interface: Well {disfmarker} industrial designer: For the remote control . {vocalsound} project manager: It could be be {disfmarker} Yeah , you never know , but {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Why not ? marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: More money for us . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: But it {disfmarker} and I think we have to make it quite big . user interface: Yeah . Quite big . Yeah , you think ? project manager: Yeah , marketing: Yes , definitely , definitely . project manager: {gap} people {disfmarker} industrial designer: That's to be uh a formed for your hand . project manager: So , and and also because uh it is expensive . If you want it to be something , you know , it's ha doesn't have much functions {gap} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: want to be {disfmarker} you don't want to get it l make it {disfmarker} marketing: Yes , it {disfmarker} it it should be f {vocalsound} be visible nearly anywhere in the room . As I uh as I said during my presentation , fifty percent uh o project manager: Mm-hmm . And shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table . I I think you m might wanna put it uh {vocalsound} user interface: A standard or something . project manager: {disfmarker} yeah , that it it it it stands up . Yeah , you have to put it on its {disfmarker} So it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table . marketing: Yeah . A face ? project manager: {gap} no no , {gap} put stuff inside it . But , it's like like a statue or something {gap} {disfmarker} marketing: Or uh yeah , yeah . Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: More like a joystick then . marketing: Yeah , yeah , I see what you mean , yep . user interface: It's like you have uh four phones . Something like that . project manager: Yeah yeah , but {disfmarker} yeah , but you also can put it somewhere near the window in {disfmarker} marketing: If you do that , but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros . project manager: That it's it's fashionable . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} I {gap} I don't {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} I in in the base we could like make uh a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise . project manager: Oh , yeah . marketing: That's probably stupid , but uh as I found here uh , fifty percent , was it fifty ? industrial designer: But that's that's fun for the first time , and then the second {disfmarker} marketing: Uh fifty percent fifty percent often loses remote control . project manager: Yeah , but but when you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it {disfmarker} marketing: No uh , of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in . project manager: {vocalsound} Oh , okay . user interface: On the television . project manager: {vocalsound} Uh , that's kind of nice . user interface: Oh , like this . marketing: If an {disfmarker} a button in in that uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: And then also you don't even need batteries , because you can make it uh chargeable . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Or you can {disfmarker} user interface: A char {vocalsound} chargeable . Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , you can ma make rechargeable one , yeah . Why not . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , that w yeah , but {disfmarker} yeah , the pro No , well I think that it might be t p Well , nee but we don't {disfmarker} Yeah . user interface: Why not . project manager: Maybe you , but {vocalsound} we don't know much about production cost , but when you {disfmarker} you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control , then the then the money {disfmarker} there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know , {gap} rechargeable units . industrial designer: With recharger . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: It should only cost twelve and a half Euros , of course . Aye ? project manager: Yeah , but we would d ma we'd do it in Taiwan and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So , it's not gonna be that expen user interface: Production . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , okay . {vocalsound} project manager: Uh I I think it's a great idea . user interface: It should be possible . I think it's a good idea . marketing: Yeah . project manager: S some kind of be I've never seen that before , and you make it uh um be uh , you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays . user interface: To make a base or something ? marketing: Yes . Yes , definitely . Yeah . industrial designer: Yes , but is that handy ? project manager: Well , I {disfmarker} well it's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem . That's one {gap} . user interface: It's it's it's it's project manager: And uh you can always find your remote control up {disfmarker} user interface: it's not the purpose to be handy , it's industrial designer: But but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years , three years , with with t two batteries . project manager: Uh , okay . Well , maybe yeah , you could {disfmarker} when that's {disfmarker} when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , industrial designer: And then you {disfmarker} project manager: but you will {disfmarker} you do need uh also an {disfmarker} uh , also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well , you know . Does it makes it kinda {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes . Or {disfmarker} marketing: Well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , of course . user interface: Mm . Yeah , but that's not {disfmarker} it's ugly , I think . project manager: Yeah , yeah . Okay . Yeah . marketing: I don't know . project manager: Yeah , but then it's very easy to make it also a rechargeab I don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it . user interface: No . marketing: On the other hand , if you don't do it , we can also make a nice bay . I mean , it looks trendy and still {vocalsound} still put a bleep function in it , project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: but um I think the bay is definitely uh {disfmarker} project manager: I think it's a good idea . And make it , you know , we we um {disfmarker} Well , we uh {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} it isn't a t a most uh costly uh remote control . We can save on the on the functions . We just {vocalsound} put some simple button in , make it big and sturdy , nothing more , and just make s sure there's some noise that it can make , or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up , marketing: Sure , why not . Yep . project manager: it's also nice . And if you put it away , I think it's uh w we have to {disfmarker} we uh {disfmarker} that's uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: it's not a easy market . user interface: Yeah . project manager: We have to something special . And for twenty five Euros people want something remote c special from your mote control , marketing: Yeah . user interface: True . project manager: and we can't deliver that in r with uh regards to the functions , user interface: Yeah . marketing: Definitely . project manager: because we aren't gonna put {disfmarker} marketing: With eye candy , ear candy , whatever . Yeah , definitely . project manager: Yeah . And then uh when make it , you know , nice looking shape and this {gap} {disfmarker} and then you also you got the stand-up thing . Yeah . I think I think it's a good idea . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , it must be must be a gadget to have . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Definitely , yeah . project manager: Oh , if it {disfmarker} let's {disfmarker} well , we will see what's possible concerning the the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that . And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing . user interface: Yeah . project manager: And the first thing we {disfmarker} the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something . If that's too expensive , we won't do that . user interface: Yeah , we c project manager: But it would be nice . marketing: {vocalsound} It would be nice , yes . project manager: It's the idea . I know that batteries last long nowadays . And and what people just think about , well , I'll never have to buy any r batteries again , so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty . And you know then when you haven't batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo {gap} {disfmarker} I've experienced that that {disfmarker} marketing: Most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty , so {vocalsound} yes . project manager: Yeah , okay . So , easy functions . Well , we will we will {disfmarker} I think we'll work that out , zapping , numbers on it , bi user interface: Or just give a beep when the battery's out or uh down . project manager: Yeah . But it's also annoying . marketing: Yeah , why not . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} 'cause as long as it stays {disfmarker} as it ke keeps working , you're not very motivated to do something about it . marketing: Hmm . user interface: Yeah . {gap} true . project manager: Then it beeps all the time and {gap} . marketing: No , that's true . project manager: You don't want to have {disfmarker} ever have those problems , and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable {gap} . And you don't have to use the unit , you can also put it on the side if people don't like it . Uh , i i in the in the ma marketing: Why not . industrial designer: {vocalsound} But you pay for it . project manager: Yeah , but it w I mean , if if they pay for it because they think , oh , that's a great idea , I'm gonna use it . And when it , you know , when time goes by and they think , well , I'll never put him in the recharger , I think last long enough , then they put it on side and they can use it now and then . Then when they look {disfmarker} get m I I I know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control , within a couple of months of {disfmarker} they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control , they wanna see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh , user interface: Yeah . project manager: I think it's brilliant . marketing: Bleep bleep bleep , oh there it is , yeah . Yeah . project manager: Yeah , I've never {disfmarker} it's so simple , but I've never seen it . user interface: Yeah . project manager: M maybe we should really {vocalsound} do this . user interface: And you can leave it just there . marketing: No . Nearly . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} {vocalsound} Okay now , well , how much time have we got left ? These clocks aren't uh synched . user interface: {vocalsound} Yes . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Oh , now I've put uh {disfmarker} well , {gap} it is twenty p user interface: Yeah , I'll {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , so we have ten minutes or something ? marketing: Something like that , yeah . project manager: Yeah , but we're uh we're done . I think . user interface: Uh fifteen minutes . project manager: We've decided on the functions . Well , there is some {disfmarker} oh . There is a closing sheet . We have lunch break , and then we have thirty minutes of individual work . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Oh . project manager: Oh {vocalsound} okay , I'll make sure {disfmarker} I'll {disfmarker} I had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes , the the s the next minutes won't be a problem , but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too , but maybe it won't work , but you'll see . I think these are more important than the first ones , so {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} We'll see . user interface: Can you make an uh uh a part of f folder for the minutes maybe ? project manager: {gap} . user interface: That not not everything in one one uh folder . marketing: Maarten , five minutes . project manager: Oh , five minutes . Yeah , because uh I I d I did uh {disfmarker} the first minutes I did were were were a bit scratchy , you know . Then I did a s second one with a nicer layout , which I could uh , know , use for the other ones {gap} well , but uh I d think uh I forgot to do {disfmarker} put done under the first one , and when you go write a second uh it's get {disfmarker} it's not working {vocalsound} when you try to write second uh paper or something . user interface: Yeah . Maybe . marketing: No , that's true uh , yeah . project manager: And then you {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} you had to overwrite it or someth I don't know . Becau I d uh , it was not my uh pen . marketing: Should we by the way draw um project manager: {gap} this kind of looks you like . marketing: on our nice whiteboard , um a little uh idea of {disfmarker} project manager: Of the shape . marketing: yeah . project manager: Yeah , probably , it would be nice . user interface: Or the sh marketing: I dunno . Has anyone got um {vocalsound} a little bit detailed ideas about the shape ? user interface: {vocalsound} Do you get an idea of the shape ? marketing: I don't , for one . industrial designer: Maybe like this pen . marketing: A bit bigger I guess , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: No , bigger . user interface: A little bit bigger , yeah but {disfmarker} marketing: The shape is nice , it's um something different , and we want we want that . industrial designer: It has to feel nice in your hand . project manager: Well , I I {vocalsound} I have to say , I have this uh can opening remote control in my head most of all , marketing: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: or I think some {disfmarker} maybe we should {disfmarker} no , that will be too costly . user interface: Oh , uh look {disfmarker} uh look at the pictures . project manager: We shou we could also , that was a {disfmarker} would also be an idea , but I don't think it {disfmarker} I don't know if it exists already , you should like make Alessi or something design it . marketing: {vocalsound} Okay , yeah . project manager: That would also be nice . But that's gonna {disfmarker} then you c then you don't marketing: Yeah , but {vocalsound} twelve and a half Euros ? Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , but then you don't have t yeah it {disfmarker} that's not something i that's in the production cost {disfmarker} {gap} a one {disfmarker} it's a one time , you know {disfmarker} s was {disfmarker} it's a single cost . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Yeah , m but but then you can {disfmarker} nah , I don't thin I think that it would be more expensive , because I've bought the Alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive . marketing: Yeah , that's true . project manager: Would be a nice idea though . I don't know . I think it uh has to be a r {gap} it has to have round forms or something . Like something like that or so or so marketing: Something like that is very ergonomic . project manager: And on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it . It's also round . marketing: So {disfmarker} project manager: Put it in there uh {gap} wire on it . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Maybe uh , I don't know , some some lights , a big but well . {gap} user interface: Yeah , flash lights at the side . At the side , or something like that . project manager: Volume and programme , yeah . marketing: Yes , volume and programme should be there I guess , because you hands wi uh y your hands will be in the smaller part . project manager: And some of the extra funct Some of the extra functions over here . Numbers . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , and the numbers on top , I guess . user interface: Yeah . project manager: And and lights ? How we're g well , maybe uh s a ring of {disfmarker} no , no , you have to {gap} {disfmarker} Maybe on the side of it . marketing: Maybe ro roun rounds user interface: Yeah , side of it . marketing: uh uh l sorry . project manager: Along the side uh strip of {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: Just two LEDs or something on the side . Yeah . marketing: Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons . {gap} {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , but I also meant the the blinking li w you know , the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote . marketing: Oh . Okay . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Well , theys have to be {disfmarker} user interface: Well , uh probably at the side . You know look at the front , but {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Exactly . When you you see it from the side , then it would look just {gap} like that . And then you have a strip of uh lights or something user interface: Yeah , exactly , and then there is {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah , something like that , yeah . marketing: Okay , yeah . project manager: Well , uh I think it's nice , for one thing . {gap} maybe put something on top of it {vocalsound} or , you know , like that's {disfmarker} looks funny . user interface: {vocalsound} No . {vocalsound} No . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: I don't know . Or some bump . marketing: I think I think that'll be too big tha too big then . project manager: Maybe some {disfmarker} Yeah ? user interface: Bumper or something . project manager: We'll have to think about it . I think we're we're done . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Yes , we are . project manager: We can save this one . user interface: Lunch break . marketing: {vocalsound} Alright . Yes , I guess it's lunch time . user interface: Okay then . project manager: Mm mm . {gap} user interface: {gap} marketing: {vocalsound} I don't know . industrial designer: {gap} marketing: Half and hour ? user interface: Okay , five {gap} uh {disfmarker} marketing: I thought our next uh next individual round was half an hour . project manager: Yeah , that was what uh {disfmarker} marketing: I don't know about the lunch break . project manager: Mm , we'll hear about it . marketing: Well {disfmarker} user interface: Oh {gap} . {gap} . {vocalsound}
