project manager: Okay , all set ? Welcome to the conceptual design meeting . user interface: Uh , okay . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: The agenda . The opening . I'll again be the secretary and make minutes , take minutes , uh and it will be three presentations , just like the last meeting . So um , {vocalsound} who wants to start off ? Technical uh designer again ? user interface: {vocalsound} Again . project manager: Okay . user interface: Hmm . project manager: Uh , yeah . Uh , before we begin it , I want to say I've I've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder , but they're still not uh quite okay . It uh it uh still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: So {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . project manager: But uh , from now on I won't use my pen anymore , so will be p just {vocalsound} ordinary keyboard . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Uh , may be better , yeah . marketing: Keyboard work . Yeah . project manager: I think it {gap} will will be more uh easy for you to read the minutes . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Alright . industrial designer: Okay , when we talk about uh components design , um it's really about the material and the {disfmarker} and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of . Um , a remote control consist of uh components and the components of a remote control consist of uh properties and material . We have to choose th uh these uh wisely and it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of {disfmarker} in uh in buying uh the remote controls . Um , the components of a remote control are of course uh the case . Uh the properties of the case , um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh {disfmarker} yeah , it feels uh good in your hand . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm the buttons has to be uh solid too , and the material is soft rubber . Uh I've got a uh email from the possibilities of Real Reaction . Um uh they're telling me that um when we build uh a remote control of um of plastic or rubber , the uh buttons have to be uh rubber too . Mm {disfmarker} It's okay . Yeah . I when we use a rubbled {disfmarker} a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to {disfmarker} uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design , which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy . Uh {disfmarker} Um user interface: Oh . industrial designer: the energy source , uh I've got a lot of possibilities for that too . Um , uh the basic battery , which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um {disfmarker} Uh here you have to have a hand uh {disfmarker} yeah , kinetic uh energy . Also in uh this one , like in the watches , but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push uh a button and {disfmarker} so you don't have to uh walk with it all the all the time . Mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Um uh also the case material , uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird . user interface: Oh titanium is probably trendy , I think . {gap} . marketing: That's true , I guess . Yeah . user interface: Well , maybe a little bit expensive . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: I don't know . industrial designer: Uh , they don't tell anything about the cost of uh titanium . marketing: Huh . industrial designer: Um the chip {disfmarker} uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf . Also , the speaker in the remote control , when we want to retrieve it . Um , the base station is also off the shelf , all the materials and the components are uh just available in uh in our uh factory . Mm , I've told about uh the three first points . Mm , the simple electronical chip uh is is available uh with the LED transmitter uh transmitter . Uh , it's all uh off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all uh available in our company . Um , another possibility . I uh yeah , I looked up on was uh the L_C_D_ displays . Could be uh something special to our uh remote control , and it's possible , but it only cost a bit more , but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five Euros . project manager: Twelve and a half . Actually {disfmarker} industrial designer: Ah yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , production cost . industrial designer: {vocalsound} I th I got an email with uh some examples and it {disfmarker} these were were the most trendiest one . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: You see uh a covers , which can be {disfmarker} project manager: What are those , t tooth uh brushes , or so user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Um , I don't know . Um {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: But it's actually kind of uh {disfmarker} user interface: I {disfmarker} project manager: well , it resembles the design I had in mind for this proj industrial designer: Yes . project manager: You know the the cartoonish {vocalsound} Alessi kind of design . marketing: Yep . industrial designer: Yes , maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh {disfmarker} project manager: And we can we can steal their ideas . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: maybe a kind of uh whole uh um a whole set of uh different uh remote controls . project manager: Huh . industrial designer: Maybe we can bring a whole line uh with uh with a {gap} huge variety of uh project manager: Well , it's a possibility , too . industrial designer: uh house uh stuff . user interface: Different colours also . industrial designer: Like uh {vocalsound} maybe radios and uh television also uh in this in this {disfmarker} in the same style , but {disfmarker} project manager: Uh-uh . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , that'll be for the future , I guess . project manager: Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Next time we're here . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yes , because we have to uh {disfmarker} we have to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we have to bring the logo and all the stuff uh back into it . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Oh , okay . marketing: Yeah . Definitely . project manager: Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: Thank you . {vocalsound} marketing: Alright . user interface: {gap} uh {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . That's okay . user interface: Ah . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Well , I shall go to the next slide . Um marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: um , I still don't have any information about user requirements . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: I was thinking about just uh the basic functions and I got uh {disfmarker} project manager: Oh , we decided upon that in the last meeting . Didn't we ? user interface: Yeah , but but then wh I don't know when there are new user requirements . project manager: Oh , okay . Well , tha I didn't receive any new requirements or somethi user interface: I ha I ha I have the I have {disfmarker} project manager: Just {disfmarker} user interface: nothing . project manager: no , but we decided to use only b basic functions only . user interface: Well , I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of . project manager: Okay . user interface: I dunno if they're {disfmarker} maybe a little bit more , but {disfmarker} project manager: Well we {disfmarker} maybe we can think of that later . W just {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: these are the ones you already summed up in the {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , I I uh {vocalsound} well , I pointed them out here , just to make it a little bit easier . project manager: Okay . user interface: Um Another function uh is {disfmarker} of course we already discuss it on the side . Um , I don't know what costs of it . Uh , I've no idea about it . Uh , I was also looking for what you said , for {disfmarker} I got an email uh uh about uh L_C_D_ in in in front of the remote control . I don't know if that's a good idea , or maybe it's a little bit too much for twelve and a half . Production . project manager: Yeah . user interface: If we got already uh something like a base . industrial designer: Uh-huh . project manager: That might get redundant also maybe . I don't know what kind of information it would {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , I don't know . I d I uh ju I was just thinking about it . Then I got a pop-ups to go to the meeting . But {disfmarker} marketing: Mm yeah . project manager: Yeah . Yeah , it's okay . industrial designer: Maybe we can bring t uh uh teletext to the t {vocalsound} to the remote control . {vocalsound} user interface: The remote control . marketing: {vocalsound} Then you {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} {gap} a little uh too {disfmarker} {vocalsound} A little bit {disfmarker} marketing: and then you've got a flag s {vocalsound} Very big R_C_ . Yeah . project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} That's not {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It was not a good idea . user interface: A little bit too big , I think . Exactly . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . user interface: Um , yeah . Well , the functions are are not more to discuss , I think . project manager: No . No . user interface: It's it's just the base things we already discussed that the {disfmarker} no V_C_R_ or that kind of {disfmarker} marketing: No . user interface: uh , so that's very easy . Um {disfmarker} project manager: But you do mention the next and previous uh button . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: {gap} user interface: Well , that's next channel . I mean {gap} next channel . marketing: Next channel , previous channel . project manager: Oh , okay , o okay okay . user interface: Uh {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} oh , I I got an email with {disfmarker} {vocalsound} with an uh a remote control with a base . project manager: Huh . user interface: So , it's uh just an idea . And I um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: But you're the expert . {vocalsound} marketing: I think it depends on the function . user interface: Well , I'm not a e I'm the expert for user-friendly , but not for trendiness . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Maybe it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Well , if you save uh {disfmarker} Perhaps uh s tiny buttons aren't user-friendly , then we wouldn't im implement that of course . project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Well uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: okay , that's your point . Um , yeah . Yeah , okay . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , I've nothing to {vocalsound} s industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Well , w when we only use basic functions , we have the possibility to make the buttons larger . marketing: Oh , that's right . user interface: Uh , with a little bit larger , yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: I thought so , but maybe with the {disfmarker} project manager: Well , I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons , th th those two have {disfmarker} yeah , they have to be large . user interface: Yeah , that groups . project manager: Uh , I mean th th the the two two basic buttons , you know , the {disfmarker} to skip channels and to uh {disfmarker} user interface: Large ? Yeah . marketing: Yep . project manager: I think {disfmarker} yeah , I don't know why , but I think that is {disfmarker} that's t trendy too , user interface: Most {disfmarker} the most used uh buttons . marketing: Those are probably the the th project manager: because that's the mo it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} you know , it's uh acc acc um accentu uh , how do you say it ? It puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big , like t marketing: Yes . user interface: True . Yeah . marketing: Those are probably the b four most most used buttons on the th in the remote control . project manager: Yeah . And you want to acc accentuate that , you know . industrial designer: You did the research . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} It's from your research . {vocalsound} marketing: Sorry ? Yeah , sure . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . Uh , that was all y industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: uh personal preference I didn't have . project manager: Okay . user interface: I didn't had any time left . project manager: No uh , that's coo it's cool . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} You don't care . No , {vocalsound} sorry . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Oh . Go away . user interface: It's there . marketing: Come on . user interface: Yeah , click on it . marketing: {gap} . user interface: Couple time . marketing: Oh , great . Well , I've done some research again about trends on the internet . Um I've done some investigation , and uh well I uh got some information from fashion watchers from Paris and uh Milan . {vocalsound} Some uh some findings {disfmarker} the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control . Uh , well , we were going to imply that , so that's nice . The second important thing is uh innovative technology in the R_C_ . Uh , our market really likes really likes that . And uh the third point there in this uh order if {disfmarker} of importance , the third point , is a high ease of use . And uh , well , for the idea , I've put some trends uh for the market of elderly people . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Dark colours , simple recognisable shapes . So we probably won't do that . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: The younger market likes uh {disfmarker} Well , {gap} the {gap} themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: I found this image , which is uh {disfmarker} Well , it symbolises the idea of fruits and vegetables . I don't see the spongy part in it . But with a little bit of fancy {disfmarker} project manager: Well maybe c {vocalsound} then we have to do something with Sponge Bob then . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Exactly . I got some ideas {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh well , yeah , pictures isn't really good word , but um industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: some symbols of fruits or vegetables maybe . Uh , catchy colours . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Fruit is uh yellow , green , red , whatever . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: So , remote controls in in catchy colours . project manager: It doesn't stroke with the with the dark colours . marketing: Uh , no , we don't want dark colours . project manager: {vocalsound} Not the dark colours ? Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} No , I just put them there to uh , yeah , uh for general idea . project manager: Okay . marketing: And uh , the docking st industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: uh I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself . But to {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} To implement some spongy thing , maybe we can do it in the in the docking station . At the bottom of the docking station or whatever . And uh , we could bring one line with a dark colour uh to um uh p uh yeah {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: uh uh v how do you say ? project manager: For diversity or something . Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want {vocalsound} maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour . user interface: Well , how uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: I mean it it it reaches a different market uh , but it it it doesn't cost really much effort to b to uh bring uh like a black R_C_ on the market or whatever . Yes . user interface: But how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in Christ's {vocalsound} sake with {vocalsound} remote control ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: No , but I I I think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit . marketing: Yeah , there's there's always a user interface: Uh , make it a banana ? project manager: It's like a pear or something . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Well there there's always empty space of course on a remote control . I mean I think this part of the R_C_ uh well {vocalsound} the upper the upper part or whatever is uh is not not used with buttons , I guess . project manager: No , I don't think you have to do it like {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: So you you can put some fruity things {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , but it that doesn't have to remind you , you know , like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like the the the the round curves . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: No , of course not . project manager: And so y I I think this {disfmarker} y it already sem resembles uh something like a pear to me or something . marketing: Especially i user interface: Yeah , but th {vocalsound} yeah , but that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , yeah . Yeah , exactly . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , but that's {disfmarker} marketing: If we make it little bit greenish . project manager: You do get the idea , eh ? The fruity kind of round {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah uh uh {disfmarker} project manager: 'Kay . marketing: A {vocalsound} and we could use {vocalsound} one of these for the uh w what is it ? project manager: Yeah , uh {disfmarker} yeah , I don't know . industrial designer: Grapes . marketing: Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Uh , this is a b yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Isn't {disfmarker} Wha whatever . user interface: But d don't we need a creative artist or something like that to m make it to feel like a a a a vegetable or fruit ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , yeah . Of course we have uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , sure . project manager: we have a very big uh the s marketing: Yeah . Well , w we can uh {disfmarker} w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things . industrial designer: For a big team of artists . {vocalsound} project manager: Of d design team , yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: This is then the uh pear . I don't know the English word , so forget it . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's pear , I guess . marketing: {vocalsound} And um , maybe , yeah , a b a banana is uh is n {vocalsound} not easy for a remote control , but m yeah . industrial designer: But uh but I think we don't have to make project manager: {vocalsound} No . industrial designer: we can't make all uh ten designs . We have to make one design I th I I think . project manager: No , but I think it's it's already what we were were up to . marketing: Mayb maybe two or three . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Uh , it's {disfmarker} it doesn't have to resemble uh what I already said , a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like a fruity thing going on . user interface: {gap} marketing: Yeah . No sure , but but {disfmarker} project manager: And it's {disfmarker} it looks fruity to me . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: B but that's great , and and and what I was {disfmarker} project manager: And uh , but I do like the {disfmarker} marketing: what what I was saying , the catchy colours {disfmarker} project manager: yeah , I do like uh the f uh to {disfmarker} the idea of making a a y uh , a catchy colour design and a d because I do {disfmarker} I think a dark colour would be nice too . industrial designer: But pictures of fruit , vegetables vegetables {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Maybe it's too much , you know . user interface: But , we we have to um {disfmarker} There have to be the the the the firm colours , our own uh colours has to be in it . marketing: Yeah , uh not really . Pictures was a was a bad word , but {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , but what are the {disfmarker} This is yellow . marketing: Well we c yeah . user interface: Yellow , a Real Reaction . industrial designer: Yes , you can put a logo on top of it . project manager: But I don't think our our company colours are this fashionable . marketing: Yeah , sure . user interface: Uh , yeah . marketing: Maybe we can if if we got our docking station over here . user interface: {vocalsound} We uh f industrial designer: Yes , it's really fruity . {vocalsound} marketing: I can't draw with this thing , but I'll try . user interface: A yellow do marketing: If this is our docking station , we can make our logo over here . user interface: Uh , yeah . marketing: It doesn't work . And then {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , and the button then . industrial designer: With a strawberry on top . project manager: Yeah , on uh n uh on the bottom of the remote you can do {disfmarker} marketing: Well , the button button over here or whatever , user interface: Okay , yeah . marketing: I don't know . On the front , of course , because else you can't find it . user interface: Okay . marketing: Well , that were my ideas a little bit . project manager: Okay . marketing: I'll close 'em down . Um , go away . project manager: Okay , you {disfmarker} can you open the conceptual design presentation ? marketing: Conceptual design , yes . project manager: See what was on the agenda . user interface: {vocalsound} Lazy . {vocalsound} marketing: The agenda . project manager: This is his own remote . Because um , maybe we can start with the technical uh functions , user interface: Yeah . project manager: but I don't think it's there {disfmarker} uh , yeah um , do we want to um use an L_C_D_ display , for example ? marketing: Well , it's nice , of course . But I don't I don't know what to display on it . industrial designer: Only if we {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Me neither . industrial designer: Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it , for the channel you're on . marketing: I mean {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , but it's so {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , but it should be li like this big , and I don't think {disfmarker} industrial designer: No , no , only the T_V_ channel with the {disfmarker} with uh with {vocalsound} uh four programmes . project manager: I don't think we should do it . industrial designer: You can uh zap through them with the page up page down button . marketing: Yes sure , but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large L_C_D_ screen , because {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes , it can {disfmarker} On your {disfmarker} No , on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also . So why not on your remote ? project manager: Yeah , but {disfmarker} no . I do I think it's a bit redundant , actually . marketing: Yeah , I don't know . project manager: And it's also not {disfmarker} I don't th even think it it looks s like sexy or something , user interface: Well well what would you display on it then ? project manager: it's {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh , programme uh information or or or or g or a guide marketing: Programme information . user interface: But is it {disfmarker} isn't that a already on T_V_ , a lot of new T_V_s ? marketing: But {disfmarker} industrial designer: on t on teletext , yes . Also on the internet . marketing: Well a lot a lot of T_V_s indeed show uh when you uh zap to a {disfmarker} industrial designer: But {disfmarker} project manager: But you're already watching the T_V_ , you're not gonna watch your remote control . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes , but you also want to know what's next . marketing: But then we also uh w need to bring out a line of T_V_s which we were planning to , user interface: Yeah , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: and we also have to {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: but whatever . Because the T_V_ has to send information back to the R_C_ , and I don't know if that's possible . industrial designer: Yes , that's uh really possible . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Yes , yes , o of course it's possible , user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: but you gotta uh implement it in the T_V_s , and I don't think everyone's gonna buy a Real Reaction T_V_ within a month after the release of our uh remote control . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: I really understand you want to make your job more exciting {vocalsound} by putting an L_C_D_ in it , user interface: And I also {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: but I I really don't think it's a good n goo because it also doesn't stroke with {disfmarker} we wanted uh c When we talk about the materials , uh it's a good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber stuff on it . It was our idea , you know , to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it . marketing: Yeah . project manager: But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image . You know , it's like more vulnerable , and it adds nothing really , you know . marketing: That's true , that's true , it breaks f yeah , it it it's not very solid , it's uh frag fragile . project manager: Yeah , yeah . You could make it , but it's just {disfmarker} it it doesn't {disfmarker} I don't think it {disfmarker} it's coherent with the design we're after . marketing: No . No . I don't think so ei either . project manager: But that's my opinion . Well , you you y Okay , we can vote for it . You want the L_C_D_ display . I don't want to and {vocalsound} he doesn't , so it's up to him . industrial designer: {vocalsound} No . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} If we wanna {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , I dunno . marketing: {vocalsound} . Ah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: And I've read somewhere that I've got some kind of veto veto uh rights . user interface: {vocalsound} . Oh , okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Bastard . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} So I can also say {disfmarker} user interface: We can {gap} you away . project manager: But did we skip the {disfmarker} Yeah , you could do {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: m but what what i so what i but do you think we should {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , I don't know . Uh , uh I {disfmarker} i if it's it's a simple p project manager: We're not even sure what what information we want to display on it . So {disfmarker} user interface: No , that that's right , industrial designer: No uh um {disfmarker} user interface: and uh I also have to think about new functions , maybe buttons or something like that to control it . Kind of L_C_D_ or something or {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Y yes , you can use uh buttons uh uh w that are already uh on the remote control for double functions . marketing: Yeah , I guess . user interface: But how does it display then ? W when I go to the second channel , what what does it show me ? industrial designer: Uh , then you push a button . The title and the information about the programme . user interface: About that programme ? industrial designer: But but uh {disfmarker} yeah , what he said was right , about the televisions , they have to be uh customised to the {disfmarker} project manager: Nah , that's not gonna work . industrial designer: But maybe in future it will be a giant hit , and when you are the first marketing: No . project manager: Yeah . Oh , well uh I've seen it done before . industrial designer: you have the biggest uh {disfmarker} project manager: Do you know th like the the bigger rem uh universal remotes , they have d L_C_D_ displays , user interface: Yeah . project manager: but then it's very functional to indicate which {disfmarker} what uh uh device you are controlling . So it's {disfmarker} that that's what I've seen . industrial designer: Yes , you can put uh a little L_C_D_ display on it with uh with lots of information . marketing: Yeah , that's true , if you uh {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: But it just {disfmarker} it j it doesn't doesn't match with the {gap} our whole basic concept . industrial designer: But uh I haven't thought about it . But whe but when you put a a a transparent uh plastic uh uh screen on top of it , it i it isn't vulnerable . project manager: Well yeah , yeah , okay . That's maybe not the most important , industrial designer: You can throw with it and {disfmarker} project manager: but it's just {disfmarker} user interface: Is it fashion ? project manager: I don't think so . industrial designer: When when you put uh maybe a colour L_C_D_ t uh screen on it , it's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} I don't know . That's not up to you . That's up to market if i if it's trendy . project manager: Yeah , well do you ha do you have to {disfmarker} {gap} You haven't looked after the trendiness of L_C_D_ displays , have you ? marketing: {vocalsound} No . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} Because our our motto is we put fashion {disfmarker} marketing: Well , I think it's uh I think it's pretty trendy , to be honest , uh but um I don't know if if if {disfmarker} well , I'm coming back to the costs again , but I think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits . And I think uh especially colour L_C_D_ , which is indeed pretty trendy . But I don't think {disfmarker} Uh , I think it will be too expensive . industrial designer: But uh I've got a {disfmarker} the email with uh with the possibilities . {vocalsound} And L_C_D_ was a possibility for the remote control . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah yeah yeah . industrial designer: So why don't we use it . project manager: Yeah , but we're gonna {disfmarker} if it {disfmarker} marketing: Uh , did it say a price also uh for for uh monogramme uh L_C_D_ or uh coloured L_C_D_ ? user interface: Yeah , if you want to be trendy you have to be coloured . Coloured {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah really , user interface: If you have black and white or something , or grey , that's {disfmarker} marketing: if y if you c i project manager: Then uh then you better don't {disfmarker} yeah , d marketing: I in in two thousand and four you can't uh put something on the market which is a monogramme . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Really . {vocalsound} industrial designer: No , but it doesn't sa say anything about a colour or {disfmarker} But , mm , I alf I also got a possibility to put uh a scroll button on it . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Uh uh I really don't feel the whole idea of an L_C_D_ display . industrial designer: I didn't think that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} project manager: I'm sorry . It can't co you cannot convince me . I don't know how {disfmarker} well how to {disfmarker} with you guys , but {disfmarker} I don't really feel it . We already {disfmarker} we're uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} It's too much uh maybe uh with with the L_C_D_ and the docking station and {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , we already have the the th th th base station gadgets , marketing: Yeah . project manager: and want {disfmarker} and it {disfmarker} uh uh , do {disfmarker} it has to be a simple design , which sturdy , which soft {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes , but o on the {disfmarker} marketing: W we've we've gotta find a balance , of course . user interface: With one thing special . marketing: And I think {disfmarker} user interface: Not a whole package of specialty . project manager: I don't think {disfmarker} I j uh , and really , I don't see how the the L_C_D_ display is gonna add anything , you know , on a design level . Uh , I think it's slicker to have no L_ CEDs . industrial designer: No , when y project manager: Y we want to {disfmarker} it's simplicity , w you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons , so you don't need an L_C_D_ . industrial designer: But it look {disfmarker} Yes , but that remote controls are already on the market . The simple {disfmarker} project manager: It doesn't fit in our philosophy uh behind the whole remote . industrial designer: Yes , but but when you want to have something special {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , but we already have the docking station , which is {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yes , but you had a picture of it from another company . user interface: And uh the {disfmarker} marketing: We have a pear . project manager: {vocalsound} {gap} It has to be developed , user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: but {disfmarker} no , but it {disfmarker} that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: that's our that's our killer feature . user interface: It's just an it's just an idea . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: That's our {disfmarker} what makes it special . user interface: It's a it's {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes , it was already made . Tha the remote control on the docking station . project manager: Yeah , we're gonna develop our own r n docking station . user interface: True . marketing: Is that so ? Was it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it wasn't just a prototype ? user interface: Well uh I uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes , he have a picture of it . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , I dunno . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: Exactly , I've never seen it in a store . project manager: Uh , but re we really have to cut this off , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: I re I know you {disfmarker} I I I I {vocalsound} I get the idea you really like it , you know , the the L_C_D_ thing , but I I think it's it's not a good idea , and we have already mentioned all the arguments . I don't {disfmarker} uh , do you guys agre How do you guys think ? I d user interface: No , it's too much . marketing: I think it's a little too much , yeah . user interface: It's overdone . project manager: Okay , we s skip the {vocalsound} L_C_D_ display . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: I'm sorry , maybe you can do something if we are at your own place , or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something . user interface: {vocalsound} Democratically . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} No . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mayb {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound} project manager: But {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} I will rule the world with it . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Probably so . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager: Okay . But for the technical part . The m material , I think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber . Uh industrial designer: Yes , maybe a bit of a cushion is {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah yeah yeah , p Exactly . This is what it w Yeah , but it it was already what we're uh we're after , you know , to give it uh , you know , the soft touch in your hands marketing: Yeah , for the spongy uh feel . {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: Yes . user interface: With a spongy Bob feel . project manager: and also to , know , like {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , that is y the b airbag kind of thing . industrial designer: Like a b yes . project manager: You can st throw it at your little brother's head . user interface: Yeah , you just can drop it . Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , airbag . If you drop it if you drop it the airbag comes out , yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . No no no , not that comfy . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Maybe it {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: but then we have to look that it uh w uh will not um be too childish to see . project manager: Yeah yeah . Yeah . Okay , that's a that's a good point . And that's why I like the dark t col dark colour bit , you know , because it may be {disfmarker} the design uh , it's uh maybe it is a bit of the {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: But not black I think . project manager: it's a bit nineties maybe , what we're what we're up to rat fun to this point . marketing: No . user interface: Well if if it's fruit and vegetables , it have to be colourful . project manager: Yeah , that's that's true , but but it has to be a little big solid . marketing: Yeah , b yeah , that's what w I I was pointing at . user interface: But can we ge uh uh {disfmarker} project manager: It mustn't be too , n you know , th too overwhelming , then when you put it on your {gap} just {disfmarker} user interface: Can we combine it or something ? Uh with uh yellow and black ? project manager: Yeah . Yeah , maybe so . user interface: Make it a bee ? {vocalsound} A bee . {vocalsound} marketing: What ? Oh , a bee . Oh . {vocalsound} project manager: No , uh I don't like the yellow and black combination {gap} . But it is our company colours . Apparently . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , {gap} it's our {disfmarker} yeah . We we have to use yellow . industrial designer: Yes , real real good colours . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Hmm . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: I don't like yellow , and uh maybe {disfmarker} I don't know . marketing: Well , we can as as I industrial designer: But that's not really fruity . marketing: draw really nicely over there . {vocalsound} We can put the logo on our uh on our base station . Uh , yeah . And maybe very very tiny on the remote control itself . project manager: But {disfmarker} marketing: But , i project manager: Okay , but what {disfmarker} uh , what are other tef technical things we have to discuss ? user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh fronts of the {disfmarker} We can have uh different uh uh fronts of the project manager: Should we do that ? industrial designer: telephone . project manager: I don't think you {disfmarker} we should do that . Maybe just bring it out in different colours , user interface: Different fronts . project manager: but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards , that's also too much . marketing: Yeah . I guess that's that's enough . project manager: People don't wanna spend more money on their remote {vocalsound} control , I guess . marketing: That's way too Nokia . user interface: Yeah . Uh , you can you can l uh let choose the customer which colour he wants , yeah . industrial designer: Are these designs ? project manager: Yeah , yeah . marketing: Yeah , definitely . Just bring more designs on the market . user interface: Yeah , Three three or four uh four uh colours , or something like that . project manager: But uh , without {disfmarker} gon uh marketing: Why not , yeah . project manager: okay . So , are we through the technical part then ? industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Okay . So we uh agreed upon uh n uh well , not u unanimously or how you call it , but {disfmarker} Yeah . user interface: Well , yeah , industrial designer: It {disfmarker} this a real uh young young and dynamic uh uh styles . user interface: the {disfmarker} Three to one . {vocalsound} That's {disfmarker} project manager: The materials you uh mentioned in your your personal preferences were all {disfmarker} were quite okay . industrial designer: {gap} Yes . project manager: O o only only the last point your {disfmarker} user interface: And tita uh titanium , is {disfmarker} uh is is it a no ? industrial designer: Yes , {gap} {disfmarker} project manager: no titanium's not not out of question , I guess . user interface: Is {disfmarker} It's just like that , th this titanium . industrial designer: But also w Yes , b bu but when we use s soft project manager: But is it possible to use both the the plastic and so uh soft things and t p titanium , as well ? industrial designer: mm {disfmarker} marketing: Sure . project manager: Makes it in a homogeneous uh design . industrial designer: Mm . user interface: No , not all , not all of them . industrial designer: But it it {disfmarker} then it uh {disfmarker} you can't throw it it . It will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It will it will break other stuff w {vocalsound} when it's plastic , as well . industrial designer: when you throw with uh titanium {disfmarker} {vocalsound} with your remote control . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: No uh , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: titanium is a bit uh it's a bit harder . marketing: Yeah , that's true . project manager: No , but uh uh , you should ma Yeah . industrial designer: But also on the colours , the young {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , think of the possibilities and make it in {disfmarker} completely titanium . Well would it be more trendy ? More chic ? marketing: Yeah , I think it I think it does . user interface: Uh , I think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic . industrial designer: Yes , but a titanium remote control , when you're uh watching T_V_ uh or your hands are a little bit sweaty , and the {disfmarker} user interface: In trendy things . marketing: Yeah , o On the other hand , if you want to make fruit {disfmarker} fruity stuff with uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . It's cold in the winter . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , but I I really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big kind of thing . industrial designer: Yes . {vocalsound} project manager: But the question is i then it's , you know , is is {disfmarker} it fits in our s philosophy to make it uh sturdy and simple and uh , know , like uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , that's true , that's true . industrial designer: Sports and gaming . Define project manager: When you make it titanium , it becomes more like some kind of gadget you actually don't need . And when it's big and plastic , it's like some fun stuff you can always have around . It's always fun to have something big and plastic around . user interface: You have that uh M_P_ three player of Nike , I saw . marketing: Yes . Yeah . user interface: Isn't that titanium with a little bit of rubber ? industrial designer: Yes , it's w but it is uh plastic . user interface: Isn't it {disfmarker} Is plastic ? Well , it's titanium looking . industrial designer: Yes , w we can do that on the on the {disfmarker} marketing: What ? user interface: Yeah , he is . Here he is . Uh , the {disfmarker} I don't know if you know the M_P_ three player of Nike . 'Kay , uh that that's very uh with rubber , so it's very marketing: Oh , yeah . Okay , yeah . project manager: {gap} Yeah , that's beautiful . marketing: Yeah , I see . industrial designer: We can make this as a style too . marketing: Yeah , but but but {disfmarker} user interface: rough . industrial designer: Uh , this is uh just a {disfmarker} project manager: Oh , maybe th maybe this is an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , I th I think that's difficult , because uh that's different material , and then you gotta have like uh uh uh two material lines of of of {disfmarker} industrial designer: No , we c we can make it from the same kind of plastic . marketing: Yeah , if it's just a colour uh which you uh which you change then , I guess it's it's nice to have one of these . project manager: No , I do like the idea of maybe a t titanium kind {disfmarker} type of body w and then with s plastic colouration {gap} around it . industrial designer: Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: You know , like the the soft stuff , marketing: Yeah . project manager: but I don't know if it's possible . industrial designer: I don't have the information . Uh , I I didn't got it {disfmarker} project manager: But you can't make the plastic give uh the ti titanium look . user interface: {vocalsound} True . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: But make it just like shiny . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah yeah , true . project manager: Maybe we should uh shou industrial designer: Like the M_P_ three player . user interface: Yeah , maybe that's good idea , yeah . But if you want to la uh yeah , last longer than two weeks or something like that , you can maybe {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: And uh and marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: maybe we sh should we t {gap} I don't know if we should talk about {disfmarker} uh , how how much time have we got left ? industrial designer: Uh , in a lot of other uh user interface: I don't know . project manager: Forty minutes . user interface: What time does {disfmarker} industrial designer: in a lot of other product uh categories like uh even in b in bags industry . Uh , they began with uh t typical uh leather bags , but then they became stylish , with all all si all sort of colours , and w kind of fon {disfmarker} of uh of fronts , like we can use on the telephone and it {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Like Eastpack uh began a revolution with it with all this uh kind of bags and and colours and and {disfmarker} project manager: {gap} You putting in different colours . industrial designer: Yes , and and styles . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: They have uh also uh a kind of uh um uh roses on it , a and uh {disfmarker} marketing: Uh yeah , yeah . project manager: Okay . Yeah , but w yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Well , it is . It's a possibility . But , let's think about the bas industrial designer: Then we can always uh use the same design for a greater resemblance , but with new uh with new colours , new {disfmarker} marketing: Yes . New prints on it . Yep . project manager: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . industrial designer: yes . project manager: But wha th our basic idea {disfmarker} y I mean , you gonna {disfmarker} we're probably gonna have like two type of materials , like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it . And and pro and lights . We have to incorporate the lights too . But , uh do w gonna {gap} gonna {disfmarker} are we going to give it a two-tone colour look , like the the plastic mould is in in one colour and the s the cushion pads around it are in another colour ? Is that the idea ? Is that a good idea ? marketing: How do you mean ? Th th the uh base in a in another {disfmarker} project manager: How many colours are we {disfmarker} how many colours are we gonna {disfmarker} we're uh uh f uh f user interface: The rubber . project manager: Only five minutes left , by the way . How many colours are we gonna give it ? marketing: Yes . project manager: Like two-tone colour ? T industrial designer: There there are three uh components three components type . user interface: Yeah . Uh no , not too much I think . industrial designer: You have the buttons , the the case uh itself , and the rubber and th marketing: How the buttons {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons , {vocalsound} and the cushions as well should be in another colour . industrial designer: Yes . user interface: Or you just make uh one colour , uh maybe with a a z a kind of like a big wave or something like uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay , but not more than {disfmarker} user interface: In in another colour . project manager: Well , yeah , it's {gap} {disfmarker} user interface: Not more than two colours I think . project manager: No . user interface: It's a g a little bit too flashy . marketing: No , definitely not . project manager: Maybe we should talk about it on a l in a later meeting . industrial designer: Yeah , or or when you use the buttons as black , it {disfmarker} you can use two colours as well uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yes , definitely . project manager: Okay . But we have to uh think of some other uh important things . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh {disfmarker} oh yeah , the the functionalities of the the buttons . user interface: The funct yeah , I was I was thinking about th the st do we still want a joystick idea . project manager: No . {vocalsound} marketing: No , I think that's too vulnerable . project manager: I think this is okay , user interface: Yeah . project manager: the {disfmarker} so we have the basic . Then we have the numbers . We have the power button . We have we have a teletext button . user interface: The volume , teletext and {disfmarker} project manager: And maybe want to access a a menu or something . Most T_V_s have a menu . marketing: Yeah , but that's that's {disfmarker} I was thinking that's gotta be on the television . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , but I think you ha I really need a menu button . user interface: Yeah yeah yeah yeah , b project manager: That's just i the only button {disfmarker} only {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , but wha what kind of menu ? project manager: You know , I {disfmarker} user interface: Is uh {disfmarker} isn't that different from every television ? project manager: {vocalsound} No , I think most T_V_s have an uh a menu nowadays to access the uh uh screen settings . And so {disfmarker} marketing: Mm . {vocalsound} Yeah , if it's c if {disfmarker} Yeah , I think it's okay to to add a menu button for uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: But that that covers all the all the other settings . It covers everything then . marketing: and if the T_V_ doesn't have a menu , then {disfmarker} industrial designer: But then you have to put uh up and down and uh left and right {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: No , you can use the {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever . project manager: And you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Th in that way we have like only the numbers , the power button , skip and volume , and then uh uh ten uh rem marketing: Mm , yeah . A mute and a teletext and a menu . project manager: uh yeah , mute . A teletext and a menu , and then then i that's it . user interface: Mute . project manager: It's all we need . marketing: That's all . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Hmm . project manager: Okay , uh another stuf some stuff {vocalsound} about the the the design of the docking station . marketing: Great . Yeah . user interface: Okay , that's not mu not much functions . So {disfmarker} project manager: Something important about a s uh , no , uh which sh uh should remind us of the remote itself , I guess . marketing: Yeah , definitely . project manager: Uh , in one colour . marketing: Are we gonna do something with the uh spongy thing there ? project manager: Just use {disfmarker} I think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions , pads and things on the s uh side . industrial designer: Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , that's true , that's true . project manager: And we will make it spongy and {disfmarker} and uh and uh well , the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did {disfmarker} I think this is kind of fruity , you know . Just round shapes with uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , it's kinda fruity , and with th with catchy colours uh uh w project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , but we're gonna have to {disfmarker} we really have to think {disfmarker} I think colours is very important , because it has to be flashy , but {disfmarker} and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying , that when you uh , know , some things is just over the top , and when you have it on your table for more than two weeks , you {disfmarker} {gap} it just gets annoying , because it's so big and flashy . marketing: Yeah , definitely . project manager: Uh , it has to be some level of subtlety , but we have to {disfmarker} still have to think of how we manage to uh to get to that . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay . Guess we're through then . marketing: Okay . user interface: Okay . marketing: I guess so . project manager: But we {disfmarker} I think also we just {disfmarker} so we have to do something with colour but also , I I think we have to keep the dark colour thing in mind . I think that's uh adds to the {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yes . project manager: too much colour maybe m um {disfmarker} user interface: Too much colour , i it uh {disfmarker} when you got it in a living room , it's too much maybe project manager: But our des design experts will uh work that out . marketing: Yea yeah . user interface: . It has to be {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , well I think the meeting will be over within a minute . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yep . project manager: So we will wrap up . marketing: Something like that . project manager: Or is there anything we'd like to discuss ? That's right . marketing: I guess not . project manager: Okay . marketing: Do you , guys ? user interface: No . marketing: No ? project manager: Okay . Well , you will read the minutes uh in the {disfmarker} you can find them in the {disfmarker} user interface: Oh , okay , yeah . marketing: In the shared folder . project manager: pro probably . Yeah {disfmarker} uh no , for su for sure because I'm will now type them out . industrial designer: What are we going to do now ? project manager: Uh , y yeah . marketing: You'll see in you email , I guess . user interface: Yeah . project manager: I think uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , I don't know . I don't know . user interface: {vocalsound} I hope so . And the other thing is that you don't have kind of prototype or something like that . You see a kinda prototype you can {disfmarker} a little bit more uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: I will make one in the next uh twenty minutes . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Construct one , yeah . project manager: But {gap} toilet paper roll and uh {disfmarker} user interface: With you laptop ? {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . user interface: Oh my God . marketing: Alright , shall we get back to work ? project manager: Yep . I was waiting for the l last message , but {disfmarker} marketing: Great . user interface: Well you are . We're not . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} Bastard . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Back to the pen . project manager: Mm yeah . marketing: You lazy {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound}
