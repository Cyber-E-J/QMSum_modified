project manager: {vocalsound} Uh welcome back after lunch , I hope uh you had a good lunch together . For uh this meeting the main agenda okay uh to discuss about the conceptual design meeting . Okay and the agenda will be the opening and uh {disfmarker} that's uh {disfmarker} the product manager or secretary that's me and uh the presentations from the Christine and uh Agnes and from Mister Ed . And finally in this meeting we have to decide marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and uh the functional design So we have forty minutes , I think it's uh little bit uh low , but I I hope we can finish it up {vocalsound} so I'll handle to the the functional team , to the Christine , okay , to discuss about uh the components concept . industrial designer: Okay . So uh , if you could open the PowerPoint presentation . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I'm number two . project manager: You're number two . 'Kay industrial designer: {vocalsound} Components design , there we go . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So uh can we put it in slide show mode ? Yeah . project manager: The next one . industrial designer: Right here , is that little {disfmarker} that one , yes please . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Thank you . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I'll take the mouse . {vocalsound} So uh project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: we were looking he specifically at the components uh {disfmarker} the following components , uh the case , the power supply , uh the means of communications with the television set . In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition , project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: you have to have microphone {disfmarker} well no you don't actually I haven't {disfmarker} have to have microphone in the device , but um maybe you do have it a a way {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: it has to it has to hear the speaker user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: and um , so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone , um and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost . Um so the other w thing that we {disfmarker} So . Our method for going about this is we've looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't and then we also um {disfmarker} we wanted to evaluate some new materials marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might {vocalsound} come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , so uh this is the approach that we took during our um {disfmarker} our research . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So um for the case , um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Course , you know , I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh {disfmarker} we can really seriously explore , user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} so then we were thinking about um rubber , but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: and th um there might be some {vocalsound} problems with the m uh how it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh goes with the board . {vocalsound} Uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle {disfmarker} it gets brittle after a while , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: so um we still had titanium and and wood available , but um unfortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium , although how {vocalsound} Apple did it with th PowerBook I'm not su quite sure but uh nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood . user interface: {vocalsound} At least it's environmentally friendly . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} So , {vocalsound} this is our finding . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: And a as she said , it's an environmentally friendly uh material , so we're {disfmarker} we're {vocalsound} currently uh proposing , marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: uh we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {disfmarker} uh these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence with this simple one . And um then there was the regular which {vocalsound} I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one . Uh the other option was this advanced chip on print , {vocalsound} and uh we liked th we we found that it it includes this infrared sender , marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: which w 'member the beam was {disfmarker} that was an important component of finding the right chip . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: And uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so uh we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . I think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a {disfmarker} this um three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then I uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . So this is the findings of our research marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood . Do you have any problems with that ? project manager: {vocalsound} Can you go back uh one slide ? industrial designer: I'm not sure , how do I {disfmarker} Oh , I know , let's see . user interface: Thank you . Yeah . industrial designer: Let's go back up here . project manager: Yes , uh {gap} question , uh , what's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ? What's the meaning of that ? industrial designer: I think it's um um a multiple uh chip design um {vocalsound} and it's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh I could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting . project manager: Yeah , is it means it's on the {disfmarker} yeah is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} I don't know , but I'll find out more at our next meeting . project manager: Okay , tha that would be great , so if you find out from the technology background , okay , so that would be good . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Sounds good . user interface: Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ? industrial designer: Because um it gets brittle , cracks {disfmarker} user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Um We want {disfmarker} we expect these um {vocalsound} uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years . So . {vocalsound} Good ex {vocalsound} {gap} Good expression . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Whic marketing: Wow , user interface: {vocalsound} Which {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} good expression . Well after us . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I don't know , speak for yourself , I'm planning to be around for a while . {vocalsound} user interface: Although I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems , wouldn't you , I mean it chips , it if you drop it , industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: uh it's {disfmarker} I'm not su {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: So {gap} so you're not convinced about the the wood , yes . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} you're what ? marketing: Actually , I'm ready to sell it . user interface: I think {vocalsound} if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work , marketing: I'm ready to sell it . industrial designer: {vocalsound} You think ? {vocalsound} And you could {disfmarker} you could sell oils with it , to take care of it . user interface: but you can't just use {disfmarker} marketing: No y {vocalsound} no no no , the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood , user interface: Yeah , exactly , yeah . marketing: but there are some very pretty woods out there {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well I'm glad you {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: That's actually very innovative idea . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay , good . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Well , it's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: The stain . marketing: {vocalsound} I mean it's {disfmarker} each person is gonna have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that's not on the market . industrial designer: Mm . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , so it it's looks good the the design the functional design uh , what about yo you ? marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Um , in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own {disfmarker} project manager: Yes , in t yes , in term in terms of comments first {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} In turns of wow . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: She works in the cubicle next to me so she's uh she was already a little bit prepared for this {vocalsound} . user interface: Y yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Luckily Ed was not . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Wood ? {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} I think we can get the quality materials then {vocalsound} it shouldn't influence the design principles too much , which you'll see with my presentation . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: One thing we'd have to check though is what the users {disfmarker} whether {disfmarker} how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . Yeah , you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your {disfmarker} user interface: {disfmarker} Yeah , for example . {vocalsound} So , have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that , marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} It's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it {vocalsound} {gap} for teething . user interface: but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: They do that anyway with the rubber and plastic , industrial designer: Yeah , they do it with other materials as well , yeah . marketing: so {vocalsound} , and chew 'em up . And chew 'em up . project manager: Okay then , uh , let's move to Agnes . user interface: Sure . industrial designer: Oh , I'm sorry . project manager: S you're {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: You are in participant three . user interface: One point three , yeah marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Uh , yeah . project manager: This one ? user interface: I think so , yeah . Yeah , that's the one . So , it's a very short presentation , 'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , um , which basically shows , sort of {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: I took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Right , my hand is uh different size than yours for example . user interface: {vocalsound} So , that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability . Um , one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones , marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: And also {vocalsound} um you had issues with the batteries running out , marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is {disfmarker} starts to die . And in terms of invisible features , audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: So , in terms of what this thing would actually look like {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Despite working in interface design , I'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you'll have to forgive me . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . And then here you'd have your sort of standard , telephonish number pad . {vocalsound} And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your T_V_ project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . So that if the user doesn't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you . industrial designer: Mm . Mm-hmm . user interface: {vocalsound} Um , so again you can have a little L_C_D_ light somewhere , the flip {vocalsound} thing and {disfmarker} Have I forgotten anything ? I don't think so . So , as you can see , it's a very very simple design , marketing: No . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: which is one of the things I really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . Think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: A hinge . Be like a copper hinge or you know . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . But you also have to d start watching out for the weight , 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . Mm . user interface: But that's the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else . As you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably , {vocalsound} you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences . industrial designer: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . {vocalsound} marketing: Hmm . user interface: So , that's pretty much {vocalsound} all I had to say , I mean , everything else in terms of design issues . Um the centering of the key pad and {vocalsound} the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the the volume control and uh the browsing more than the actual number pad , so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control , industrial designer: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . user interface: the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently . industrial designer: Mm . Mm-hmm . user interface: So once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , but more or less I think it should go along those lines . project manager: {vocalsound} So what's your , uh , the comments or uh s marketing: Simple design . It's what consumers want . project manager: Okay marketing: It's almost like , Houston , we have a product here . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: Problem is obviously gonna be cost . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Okay , I also have a f {vocalsound} very simple presentation , project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} I also have uh copied a different type of remote . If you can find me , where I'm at . {vocalsound} There should only be one in here . {gap} trend watch . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Sure . marketing: It's being modified . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} They're stealing our product . {vocalsound} We've been giving simple {vocalsound} questionnaires in different areas because th {gap} obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today , 'cause uh trends change very very quickly . In six months maybe this idea is already gone out the window , so it's gonna be a question how fast we can act . Uh they already erased the rest of mine , huh . industrial designer: No , user interface: No , no . industrial designer: f go to findings . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: No no , no no . {vocalsound} 'Cause I had another comment there . Uh the market trend . This is what we know from the last uh {disfmarker} from the {vocalsound} questionnaires from the the {disfmarker} all the p surveys we've done , fancy and feel-good , that's what we've been looking for , something that feels good in the hand , that's easy to use . Looking for next generation of innovation , because all the remotes out there now , they're all very similar , they all do the same thing , project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: we have to have something completely different . Okay ? Easy to use , has always has become {disfmarker} has become another major interest that uh , with the whiteboard we can see that it's a remote that's easy to use . And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . So even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they {gap} look {disfmarker} it looks and feels good and has technology . The second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design . {vocalsound} The second one , there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , uh very hard to use . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: The first one , I see {vocalsound} that they put in a display . Now there's something else uh with the little flip-up , now we're adding all kinds of things in , user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: but with the little flip-up , if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Maybe the display also makes it easier to use , because sometimes when you're looking for buttons , maybe if you see a display {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Context-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in . user interface: Right . marketing: {vocalsound} Okay Because I've seen {disfmarker} mostly the standard ones , user interface: Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and marketing: yeah . Now you have it {disfmarker} now you have one with the very simple also . The idea is simple , but with a display , so you can see what you're doing . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , trendy , fancy , feels good , {vocalsound} uh with a display , wood , designer wood , designer colours user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: You know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um {vocalsound} a uh {vocalsound} uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball , marketing: , we might've {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Oh yeah . industrial designer: and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand . user interface: Yeah , so it's really molded to to your specific {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} To t {vocalsound} an and then you would know like {vocalsound} um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh {disfmarker} marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: How hard they squeeze ? user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yes {vocalsound} you'd know what kind of wood to get . marketing: {vocalsound} Resistance resistance , right . {vocalsound} user interface: But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if {disfmarker} unless everyone has their own personal remote . industrial designer: {vocalsound} That's right , that's right , you wouldn't wanna go too far down that . Oh that {disfmarker} that actually would uh increase the um {disfmarker} the revenues we could expect , yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: The sales , yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: The {disfmarker} Yeah . I hope so . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: No , but incorporating the three uh obviously it'd be something totally new on the market , totally different user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: and from {disfmarker} user interface: Well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick . marketing: {vocalsound} Although , what it {disfmarker} was it uh {disfmarker} it was uh Nokia that came out with this changeable colours . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: Right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Right , mm . user interface: And that took off , yeah , yeah . marketing: and then they sold millions , millions . So . So say with the f with the findings , with the research , easy to use something totally new . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: We have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market . industrial designer: We'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might wanna um learn about um {vocalsound} labour laws . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap , but you don't wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yeah , but we can get a production in , uh {vocalsound} , countries like , uh , India industrial designer: Cost of living is low . project manager: {disfmarker} yes , yes , countries like India or China or Malaysia , so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Good , well th that'd be something that manufacturing would have to um explore more project manager: Yeah , {vocalsound} yeah , so Yes . user interface: Mm yeah . industrial designer: and to where {disfmarker} marketing: Where w Where it would be manufactured is is another step . project manager: So {disfmarker} Yeah , so {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah marketing: We're here to design , come up with a nice product . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yes uh , but uh that that we can that we can talk about the production later , okay , depends on the the quantity , okay . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: So we don't need to have our own uh fabric factory or something , industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric , okay , for the different uh electronics items , then we can have a business tie-up and to get {disfmarker} to cut the cost , okay , to sell more . So , but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay , if is acceptable for both of you , what uh Ed was talking . And your design {vocalsound} whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so user interface: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} I think it depends , I mean I think it's a good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display {vocalsound} right in front of you . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: So , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go . industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: very specifically what it would be used for , industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: 'cause if it's only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: but that's just sort of speculation , I mean . industrial designer: {vocalsound} What do you think Ed ? Do you {disfmarker} he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , um , do you know how much it costs , um , to to add a little display like this uh ? marketing: {vocalsound} No . No industrial designer: {vocalsound} Do you wanna take an action item to go find out ? marketing: {gap} no p spec {vocalsound} It's 'cause we have to find out cost on it . industrial designer: Okay . {vocalsound} Sorry about that . marketing: Um , no that's no problem . I'm here for the {vocalsound} pushing it after it's made . {vocalsound} project manager: Yes . marketing: I will market it . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Once we get a price on it then we can market it . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So the {vocalsound} the advanced chip on print is what um what we've {vocalsound} we've deci we've determined marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and um I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case . project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} industrial designer: A customisable and {disfmarker} marketing: Nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case . {vocalsound} user interface: What about the buttons , would {disfmarker} Would the buttons be wood too , or {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Uh I don't think so , no , project manager: I don't think so . industrial designer: I think they could be rubber like they are now , project manager: Yes . Yes . industrial designer: so you have that tactile experience of {disfmarker} project manager: Don't looks nice uh . Yeah , so uh what we'll do is , uh , we will stick with the the simple design for time being until uh th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display . Okay . So user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: maybe what you can do is uh , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , okay , the model . user interface: Okay . project manager: Okay ? user interface: Sure . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So um are we done with this meeting ? project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , I hope , if {disfmarker} is it okay if uh they will come up with the prototype design , okay . Then they can show you how it looks like , and then we can uh submit to the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I will submit to the management . Okay ? Then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it's cost as extra for uh the display . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: An and the marketing strategy , that's very important , okay . industrial designer: And a marketing strategy . marketing: And marketing strategy , thank you . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Yes . How much you can {disfmarker} marketing: Fired . {vocalsound} project manager: how mu how much how much you can sell extra . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Of course you'll make money too , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: so it it's not only pay-out , you make money too , your commission . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , so , any questions ? user interface: No . project manager: So , by next meeting , so , please come up with the the prototype , okay , then uh , then we can proceed from there . user interface: Okay . project manager: It's okay ? user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: So thanks for all your uh efforts and coming for the meeting again , and see you soon then . Okay ? user interface: Okay . project manager: Thank you .
