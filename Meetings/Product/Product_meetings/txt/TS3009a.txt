So {vocalsound} this the opening we'll uh {disfmarker} We have to uh design a new television remote control . You have heard that uh already I think , so . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Um we want it to be original , so a nice uh a nice new design . Uh trendy , it's {vocalsound} also for young people , and we have to just uh make it uh modern . And uh friendly , so size does matter . And uh {disfmarker} Well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place , that kin those kind of things . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Other uh {disfmarker} There happen to be uh three stages . {gap} functional , conceptual , and d detailed design . Um so every time we we'll do some individual work , get meeting , talk about it , uh and then go into the next phase . That's just it . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} We have uh these two Smartboards . Um well as I just showed , there's a project management folder , a project document folder on the desktop . It just works exactly the same as a computer . You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop . So you can uh make uh {vocalsound} Words Excel , everything . Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things , you can uh draw . This is a uh well a drawing board . {gap} you have a {disfmarker} these different uh functions on the board . You can see them there . So you have a a nice pen , and it's works just like a bal ball pen . {vocalsound} This is just a {gap} . I want to uh {disfmarker} Oh yeah . Of course w {vocalsound} doesn't work any more . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Maybe you should try to write on the on the big white uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yes I will {disfmarker} industrial designer: Does it ? Yeah . It works . project manager: eraser {gap} so . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wonderful . project manager: It's fantas fantastic . We can uh uh well you can save a file . So if uh we draw we have to save everything . Don't throw anything away . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Uh just we can start a new one , and we just go on , and don't throw anything away . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Just uh let them all uh stand here . We can delete , but we don't do that . Um you can here select a pen , you can draw anything you want . It's a bit uh childish you have to write . It's not as fast as you w you know it , but it does work sometimes . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Well it's just like a normal uh paint . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: So it's gone . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Alright , yep . project manager: Well we are designers , so we have to have a a more uh a Smartboard . So that's fantastic . Um well this uh speaks for itself . We going to try it . So um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: not my idea . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Alright , your favourite animal ? {vocalsound} project manager: Yes our your favourite . So um I'm to going to have to draw a kangaroo , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: but I'm going d I'm not going to . I'm just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh beast marketing: {vocalsound} Grizzly bear . {vocalsound} project manager: w I dunno what I'm going to design . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Oh um {vocalsound} doesn't {disfmarker} oh . industrial designer: I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , 'kay . Hmm ? industrial designer: I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your personal uh enjoyment . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: I just said it's not my idea marketing: Yeah . project manager: but I am the Project Manager , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: and officially this is my idea . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I I I {vocalsound} I understand . Alright . marketing: We're kinda losing time , though . project manager: what ? marketing: We're losing time , but {disfmarker} project manager: Ah {vocalsound} the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose , loosen up , a bit uh meeting each other industrial designer: {gap} so start {disfmarker} marketing: Alright . project manager: {gap} well uh uh nice yeah . {vocalsound} Sh industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yep yes . project manager: I hope our Industrial Designer does this better because uh this is uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Don't uh count on it . project manager: No {vocalsound} {vocalsound} so a a few legs . marketing: Do we have to guess ? project manager: {vocalsound} Yes yes marketing: {vocalsound} A hippo ? {vocalsound} project manager: guess . {vocalsound} Well I should make it an hippo now . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} I think it's a mouse or a rat . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} No I don't think so . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Oh . Oh I know it . project manager: Well what is it , huh ? industrial designer: It's a hedgehog . marketing: I don't know how to call it . project manager: Yeah marketing: A hedgehog ? {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} difficult English word . I didn't knew it myself {gap} . {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} . industrial designer: Well I'm amazed uh about your uh drawing skills . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Our characteristics sum it up . Well it's uh very {vocalsound} uh painful industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {disfmarker} {vocalsound} those kind of thing . So we can uh just uh {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: We're going back and now uh our Industrial Designer can uh draw its uh most favourite animal . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I am the Industrial Designer . marketing: Alright . Thank you . project manager: Huh . industrial designer: Chief , I am the Industrial Designer . project manager: Oh uh but this uh marketing designer . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} I think {disfmarker} It's pr it resembles {vocalsound} the animal drawn by {gap} . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} {gap} marketing: It's {gap} . {vocalsound} project manager: what kind of animal is that then ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: I think {disfmarker} can I say it ? marketing: Yeah sure . project manager: Uh it {gap} . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: It's a rabbit . {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} Looks very nice , right ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: It looks amazing . project manager: No no no . What are you going to do ? {vocalsound} user interface: We want to erase it . {vocalsound} project manager: No no . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: No no save it and start a new uh {disfmarker} save it and start a new black uh doc {gap} a blank document . industrial designer: These are very impor {vocalsound} marketing: Yes . industrial designer: These are very important documents , of course , uh these drawings , uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah well we have to save everything marketing: Yes uh right . project manager: so now um the next one uh {disfmarker} {gap} and then save it and start an blank document . user interface: {vocalsound} Thanks . marketing: You go man . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . There's also different colours and different uh well pen widths uh the line the the thickness thickness . marketing: Alright . project manager: So um well you should uh try it but uh {disfmarker} marketing: I should have made mine a white rabbit . {vocalsound} project manager: Well y y y you could have but uh {vocalsound} . industrial designer: And he deliberately draws a animal we don't know the English word for . project manager: It speaks for itself . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} What the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: It looks like an uh {disfmarker} project manager: uh just a duck . {vocalsound} industrial designer: It looks like that beast from Sesame Street . project manager: {vocalsound} Nice . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} {gap} . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Big bird . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Is it a duck ? marketing: You're standing in front of it , industrial designer: It's it's uh {disfmarker} project manager: Is it a plane ? {vocalsound} marketing: I can't see it . Alright , thank you . Yeah it's a bird , but what kind of bird ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: It doesn't draw uh circles uh that easy uh . industrial designer: Do we have to uh {disfmarker} marketing: You have to push harder . project manager: Yeah just a bit a bit childish , user interface: Mm . project manager: a bit {vocalsound} . industrial designer: But we have uh {vocalsound} do we have to name the specific species of the bird ? marketing: Release your anger . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Uh no I don't . industrial designer: No ? user interface: It's just a bird . project manager: Well uh save the document industrial designer: Well wonderful . project manager: and then uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: And then a a new blank document for {gap} . {gap} uh will uh choose a new colour and a new pen width so w we can all see it . user interface: Here you go . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Why do I have to do the difficult tasks ? project manager: No well first industrial designer: Uh pen {disfmarker} project manager: yeah . industrial designer: yeah that's {gap} . project manager: And then you go to format I think {vocalsound} , and current colour {gap} industrial designer: Uh current colour . project manager: you choose a new colour . {vocalsound} And a new pen width uh {gap} also format . industrial designer: I like uh {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . industrial designer: oh they don't have pink . {vocalsound} Oh b oh {vocalsound} think this is uh {disfmarker} project manager: It's not like in paint . Line width . industrial designer: Uh ? Uh {disfmarker} project manager: And you can choose a nice one . industrial designer: Line width . project manager: Width width . user interface: Width . project manager: With each other . industrial designer: Uh {vocalsound} {vocalsound} fifteen . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Hmm . industrial designer: And I can draw ? project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} So . Just a wa that's the way we do {gap} industrial designer: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: it's quite easy . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Hmm . {vocalsound} project manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: It's a pussy cat . marketing: It's a cat . {vocalsound} project manager: Oh Pussy . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Oh the line width is too thick , but oh well . project manager: Well then you change it . And erase things . industrial designer: Uh . project manager: {vocalsound} What ? {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} It's a pig . {vocalsound} industrial designer: It smiles nicely . project manager: Super pig . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Now {vocalsound} I have to change the line width . {vocalsound} Uh one {vocalsound} {gap} . project manager: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah yeah yeah industrial designer: These are {gap} whiskers , you know . project manager: we know . {vocalsound} marketing: Right . industrial designer: Uh well I think it's obvious right now . project manager: Yes alright . It's a cat . {vocalsound} marketing: No it looks great . industrial designer: Miaow . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well if this isn't obvious {disfmarker} project manager: Well well um {disfmarker} marketing: Just save it . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah save it {vocalsound} and {vocalsound} start a new blank document . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} I'll save it {vocalsound} alright uh save . Uh yeah uh blank . project manager: Yep . So that's uh what we're going to use when we uh need it . industrial designer: Well I feel comfortable now . marketing: Oh great . project manager: Well {vocalsound} it's terrific , eh ? {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Thanks for this exercise . I feel totally at ease . marketing: It's good for group spirit . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah that's it . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} It certainly is . {vocalsound} project manager: We're one big happy family now . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah something like that . project manager: Well then uh the serious uh stuff . We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars , but uh twenty five Euros . Our profit aim is , worldwide , fifty million Euros . So I didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} {gap} we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so , keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff , and uh marketing uh research . industrial designer: Alright . marketing: Right . project manager: Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls , first {gap} about design uh about uh aim in the market etcetera ? marketing: Right . project manager: Well uh we c we can sit down uh because uh presentation can wait . We can uh take notes {vocalsound} and uh {disfmarker} Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls ? Please ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well I I didn't have to prepare anything about uh {disfmarker} {gap} project manager: No uh I did . {vocalsound} industrial designer: it's not , it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls , but uh {disfmarker} project manager: Well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then {disfmarker} marketing: I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control . project manager: Yeah yeah . marketing: On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce . project manager: Yep . That's alright . marketing: Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player project manager: That would be a nice idea , yes . marketing: so you can uh use your television and your D_V_D_ player with the same uh remote control . project manager: Yep yep yep . marketing: Furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , maybe , because we want to we want to {gap} well fifty million ? project manager: Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit , so . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: Yeah yeah user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: so a lot of people have to be able to use it . industrial designer: No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh marketing: So {disfmarker} user interface: Easy to learn . marketing: Yeah . Yeah that's right . project manager: Yes . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and numbers and uh that every culture in uh , yeah , people in every country can recognise . user interface: Yeah . project manager: I'll make uh notes and then uh maybe uh {disfmarker} well I'll put it in the project uh folder when I'm done uh just now . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: I also think we should not add too many buttons . industrial designer: Alright . marketing: Right . project manager: No that's right . user interface: Modern day uh remotes have {vocalsound} too much buttons I think . project manager: Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's {gap} user interface: Precisely . project manager: culture uh international . marketing: Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_ user interface: Yeah . marketing: and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something . project manager: Yes . user interface: Yeah indeed . industrial designer: Yeah so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah right . project manager: Yep , and maybe we do uh {vocalsound} we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player . Don't we have uh other uh ou user interface: Yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we uh we make ? project manager: Uh . industrial designer: And stereo uh s uh audio installations . project manager: We also uh just uh released a T_F_T_ uh thing I saw . marketing: Yeah so but th that's kind kind of standard T_ television so it also works on that . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yep . user interface: And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes . So we can keep that in mind . industrial designer: Most people do , yeah . project manager: Well yeah . industrial designer: It doesn't {gap} project manager: It doesn't have to be , but we can . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: it doesn't have to be {disfmarker} user interface: W well it's a n it's a new remote and you don't buy a remote if you don't have anything to uh to control with it . project manager: Well except if we deliver it together with our D_V_D_ . marketing: Yeah but {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah alright , but {disfmarker} marketing: We need to to keep it consistent with other d uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah because we look at competitors industrial designer: Well . project manager: and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: Yeah but it's {disfmarker} it has to be useable . industrial designer: It has to be different and familiar at the same time . project manager: Yes . user interface: Yeah . Yeah marketing: Yeah . user interface: we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things . project manager: Yep . industrial designer: {gap} yeah the shape will will have to be recognised . I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing {gap} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: you can make it uh triangle shaped , user interface: Well we we could make more more oval or something , and and {disfmarker} industrial designer: but that's not uh very recognisable . marketing: {vocalsound} No . project manager: Oo industrial designer: Oval ? project manager: N we can use uh it as a as a game pad . user interface: Yeah or so industrial designer: I {disfmarker} project manager: So {vocalsound} one hand has the beer , so the other hand uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Well yeah it's new . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm . {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} . Not with two hands . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah yeah yeah , right . user interface: {gap} but young people want something different marketing: No {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: and it is {disfmarker} project manager: Well i we already uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah but it's quite important that it fits . project manager: one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Oh but it ha it has to be m marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: yeah . But you still have to know it's a remote and not another {disfmarker} project manager: Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to {disfmarker} we can imagine uh user interface: Yeah alright . project manager: because it's a long time uh on the market . So the the form will have {vocalsound} been uh tested out so {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh , yeah , useful project manager: Yes . Well {vocalsound} industrial designer: or else uh they would have been ano another shape . project manager: for me personally I have a {vocalsound} a lot of remotes uh at home but {vocalsound} those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle {vocalsound} I don't like to use them . I have uh have to {disfmarker} it has to fit my hands . marketing: Yeah . project manager: When it falls over it and I just have {disfmarker} and then the button that I use most has to be here . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah marketing: It shouldn't be boxy . industrial designer: a lo {gap} the long box shape yeah . You have to {vocalsound} use one hand . project manager: It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with {gap} thumb . marketing: Nah {disfmarker} I don't agree with the long box uh shape {vocalsound} industrial designer: Why not ? marketing: it it has to be custom made for the hand . user interface: Yeah it doesn't fit {gap} . project manager: Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape , marketing: Yeah but if you shape it {disfmarker} industrial designer: but then you have {disfmarker} user interface: No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_ {gap} with their uh remotes {vocalsound} pl players {vocalsound} they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped . marketing: If {disfmarker} project manager: D_V_D_ players . Yes . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: W no w what else ? marketing: No that's ol old fashioned . industrial designer: I di user interface: Well {disfmarker} Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then ? user interface: Yes uh {disfmarker} marketing: I can imagine that us user interface: Well {vocalsound} most of {gap} of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end . marketing: Yeah right . It fits in your palms . industrial designer: Hmm . Well {vocalsound} user interface: Mm . industrial designer: but it's still then uh the the long box , uh but then with some uh round uh {vocalsound} round forms in it to fit your hand , user interface: Yeah it {disfmarker} project manager: Well {disfmarker} marketing: Hmm ? project manager: A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand . marketing: Um . industrial designer: but it's it's still {disfmarker} Yeah yeah al alright project manager: That's {disfmarker} industrial designer: but but it's still it's still {gap} sort of box , yeah . marketing: {gap} . user interface: Yeah yea industrial designer: It it has round forms marketing: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} industrial designer: but it in the end it's still the box , so that's what I mean . marketing: Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand . industrial designer: Yeah yeah I understand , but {disfmarker} no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square marketing: It shouldn't be too boxy , you know . user interface: Hmm . marketing: It's {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} No no no . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: but a also with round edges of course , user interface: {gap} . industrial designer: but in in in at the end it's still this long {vocalsound} box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh {vocalsound} to fit . marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Right maybe something like this industrial designer: Yeah yes {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} and then a button here to switch between {vocalsound} different systems like D_V_D_ player industrial designer: I thought about something like that . Yeah . marketing: and so you can {disfmarker} I've {disfmarker} industrial designer: A big recognisable button on top or something . marketing: Yeah right , and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea with the with the numbers and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: We have five minutes left . industrial designer: The buttons should uh also be not too small , not too big , of course , marketing: Right . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Yes industrial designer: and uh n uh uh not too close uh together . project manager: uh that's {vocalsound} yep . marketing: But it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button . project manager: Yep . industrial designer: Uh-huh . marketing: So there has to be some space between the buttons . industrial designer: Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions . marketing: Yeah . Yeah right right , industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: and maybe we should use colours . user interface: Yeah {gap} maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well {gap} {vocalsound} you can you can put on on them , industrial designer: Colours , yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Ha . user interface: and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs {vocalsound} marketing: That's kinda trendy . Yeah right . project manager: Sound nice . Yes . user interface: I dunno but {disfmarker} industrial designer: I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um {disfmarker} project manager: Well it's just uh about our first ideas now user interface: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {gap} . project manager: so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Right . But {disfmarker} project manager: Yes ? industrial designer: Already thought about something tha {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} I think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make , project manager: Yes . marketing: so we {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: Well thirty minutes we have . So um {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: This is about uh what we are going to uh do uh . You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh . I think . marketing: Yeah . user interface: {gap} . marketing: {vocalsound} No problem . project manager: Oh and uh that's uh that's all . So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over . industrial designer: Yeah now we can still talk about the material , project manager: Yeah yes say . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: we have some some minutes left uh {gap} I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course , hard plastic , the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh . marketing: Yeah . Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy . user interface: {gap} . project manager: Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons user interface: {gap} . industrial designer: No n n project manager: and when I've had use it much it was gone . So it has to be made in the buttons I think . user interface: Yeah that's bad , yeah . marketing: Yeah yeah yeah . project manager: It has to uh not be loose . user interface: Yeah that's important {gap} . industrial designer: Mm . Alright . And of course there are several electrical cables in it to uh {vocalsound} to connect things uh to each other . project manager: Yeah . Is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television so it's all about uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: I think so . marketing: Yeah it's univ yeah yeah yeah . industrial designer: It's a a common stan standard way {gap} project manager: It's not that in China it's different ? marketing: Yep . industrial designer: infrared beams an infrared beam I think {gap} . project manager: Yeah . But y you can have uh of course different between D_V_D_s and televisions and between {disfmarker} marketing: And you can use {disfmarker} industrial designer: It it's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah .
