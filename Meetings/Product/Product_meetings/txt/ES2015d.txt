project manager: Okay . Here we go . Alright , the agenda for thi oh . Alright . Um the agenda for this meeting {vocalsound} is um {disfmarker} we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave gave it . And um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . I have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . And um evaluate the product , as a group . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: And um {disfmarker} So first we'll have the prototype presentation . Do you need the um PowerPoint for this ? industrial designer: Um yeah . I just got a few slides , so show them . project manager: Alright . industrial designer: Thank you . Do you want to present it ? {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , here we are . user interface: {vocalsound} This is what we came up with . It's a pretty simple design . It's um based on a mango ? Yeah . And {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: On ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Mango shape . project manager: {vocalsound} A mango . Okay . user interface: Yeah . And we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here industrial designer: The L_E_D_ . user interface: and this'll be the power point , the on off button kind {disfmarker} project manager: Oh . Okay . user interface: yeah . marketing: I'm sorry . project manager: Oops . marketing: What was the {disfmarker} where's the L_E_D_ ? user interface: It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . marketing: Oh . Okay . user interface: And then the other one is the power . And uh we just have a simple design . We wanted it all to be industrial designer: So it's palm-held . user interface: accessible from your thumb industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: {disfmarker} yeah palm-held project manager: Yeah . user interface: and all the buttons are accessible from your thumb . project manager: Notice you have a number ten button . user interface: So you don't have to {disfmarker} Oh that was a mistake , wasn't it ? project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} industrial designer: You just need the nought . {vocalsound} user interface: Right no , that's a zero . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Take that one off . {vocalsound} Sorry . I was in charge of the numbers . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} No problem . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Ah . user interface: And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus . industrial designer: So one plus one would be eleven , user interface: {vocalsound} You can go one , three or something . industrial designer: or {disfmarker} project manager: Oh . You press a plus button ? user interface: You press that first and then you go one three yeah . project manager: Oh okay . I've never heard of that kind before . user interface: Well we just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah because if you {disfmarker} on your average um remote , if you press one twice you just go to {disfmarker} um or uh say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Oh , there's no e project manager: Oh . industrial designer: So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two . user interface: So the plus and then {disfmarker} marketing: okay . user interface: yeah . project manager: I marketing: Okay . project manager: But {disfmarker} Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ? user interface: No no , th all {disfmarker} that's why we have all these numbers . These numbers um these numbers all work independently up to nine . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah but I mean if you press , it'll go to that channel right away . 'Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards . user interface: Yeah . Oh no . Uh , the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine . project manager: Yeah I know , but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if I press the six it'll go to channel six , and then I'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ? marketing: Sixty . user interface: You p Oh . No you press the plus first . industrial designer: Oh . user interface: I I {disfmarker} well it doesn't {disfmarker} we haven't really s I would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five , marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: but she says plus {disfmarker} {vocalsound} press {disfmarker} which {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well I don't mind , we can further define that . user interface: what do you think is simpler ? project manager: I th Um {disfmarker} user interface: It's a {disfmarker} industrial designer: I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah it wouldn't be a problem . But I was just wondering industrial designer: But I suppose it's not as snappy . user interface: Yeah . project manager: like as long as we realise that's what it'll do . marketing: Well the there is a {disfmarker} there's a delay on remotes I think . user interface: Oops . Yeah . marketing: Where you can have it {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: it's like a five second input time . industrial designer: Yeah . If you don't put it {disfmarker} marketing: So as long as you hit them dada industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: that {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} it should be fine . project manager: Yeah . marketing: As long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Um {disfmarker} marketing: Was there {disfmarker} so on the top there is volume and {disfmarker} industrial designer: And channel , user interface: A channel . industrial designer: which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like {disfmarker} marketing: Channel up volume up . Okay cool . project manager: C_ and V_ . user interface: Just so we can flick {disfmarker} project manager: Right , where um where's the power button ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . {vocalsound} industrial designer: It's the bigger R_ . marketing: It's the R_ . project manager: Oh okay . industrial designer: So it's just like {vocalsound} . user interface: Yeah , project manager: Yeah . user interface: so it's all accessible . Without m taking your hand off the remote . industrial designer: We deci project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb . project manager: Oh okay . industrial designer: Uh e ergonomics are all considered . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Ergonomic , definitely ergonomic . user interface: And {vocalsound} it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though . user interface: Okay . {vocalsound} industrial designer: But yeah , no I mean it's a different movement marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: so {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Um and the feel of it , I mean , we've made this out of Play Doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: The spon yeah . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} this anti-R_S_I_ um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: and it just feels feels different . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Bit of a stress ball feel . industrial designer: Would you like to feel it yourselves ? user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Yes . I would . industrial designer: How it fits in the palm of your hand ? marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: My goodness . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Thanks . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} There you go . industrial designer: And you ? {vocalsound} project manager: Genevieve ? marketing: Yes project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: . Oh it's nice . Oh I think I killed the five . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: I did . project manager: And something hmm . {vocalsound} marketing: I killed the four . Oh god . {vocalsound} industrial designer: O Okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype . user interface: Of Play Doh yeah . marketing: Oh it smells good . {vocalsound} industrial designer: But we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . Or the combination . Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , project manager: Oh right . industrial designer: or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in user interface: 'Cause it'd be quite subtle and {disfmarker} industrial designer: more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish . project manager: Yeah . It looks more {disfmarker} Think like vanilla and banana would . industrial designer: Banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company {disfmarker} the yellow and black . project manager: Okay yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So that {disfmarker} for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I mean watermelon , you know , m probably appealing to the {disfmarker} project manager: Kinda Christmas , you know . industrial designer: yeah , seasonal . user interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Apple green , brown , more kinda trendy , you know , khaki {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . user interface: The pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of , project manager: Cool . user interface: and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated {vocalsound} customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . Okay . Um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device , I mean you don't need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Um , as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-R_S_I_ and that's about it . project manager: Alright , thank you very much . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Good work everyone . marketing: {vocalsound} Bravo {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Alright . And so now that we've we have a prototype , uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: So , I have something I'm going to {disfmarker} Oh wait a minute . marketing: You want the {disfmarker} project manager: Do you need to do a presentation first ? marketing: {vocalsound} I don't know what order it goes in . project manager: Yeah . I'm gonna check that out for a second . marketing: I have one . industrial designer: Mm go {disfmarker} project manager: What time is it anyw industrial designer: {gap} project manager: Oh yeah sorry you're right . Evaluation criteria is next in line . marketing: Evaluation cri Okay . That's me . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Hello . Oh there we go . Okay . Come on my computer . Come on . {vocalsound} Sorry my computer's giving me technical difficulties . project manager: Just press um function eight again . marketing: Should I press it again ? Last time I did that it sh Okay . You're right . project manager: And then again I think . One more time . marketing: Oh . Still not there . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: Okay now I think for this one I could {disfmarker} Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe I'll just do it on {disfmarker} right on the screen where you can see it . Um , we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen . Um and looking looking back at my notes from our {disfmarker} both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were , um , back to our kick-off meeting this morning . Um , and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do . Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false . So basically the lower p the lower the points the better . {vocalsound} Okay so question number one . Does the remote {disfmarker} whoops . Sorry . Oh I'm not gonna be able {disfmarker} um , I'll do it on the whiteboard . I can't change it so I'm g I'm gonna ask you to push it down once . project manager: Okay . marketing: I'll write down our scores up on the {disfmarker} project manager: Ooh . marketing: Okay so number one . Do we have a fancy look-and-feel ? industrial designer: Feel I think . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: We've been quite successful with the rubber coating project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: and {disfmarker} project manager: The look is a little bit more playful . user interface: Well {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy , but it's definitely different . project manager: Oh definitely different yeah . marketing: It's not your traditional {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: I think the colour has a lot to do with it . I mean {vocalsound} th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: It's not the kind of {disfmarker} ooh uh at all sleek project manager: Oh you were only given red and black ? industrial designer: {disfmarker} red , black and yellow , and orange . project manager: Oh okay . user interface: Yeah {vocalsound} so {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey . marketing: Yeah . user interface: So we want it to be stand out that way , anyway . project manager: Yeah . Okay . industrial designer: But if you can imagine that in like a s just a {disfmarker} maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . A metallic-y finish we were thinking . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well I know know it's for rubber . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy . {vocalsound} user interface: Polished . Okay {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . I kinda {disfmarker} I like the potato look . project manager: It's mango . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Oh well , potato , mango , fruit and veg . user interface: {vocalsound} We we were {vocalsound} we were thinking about {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: It's very different . It's what ? project manager: It's mango . {vocalsound} marketing: Oh sorry the mango the mango look . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Potato's fine . Potato's fine . user interface: yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . Totally . It's really adaptable . marketing: So I myself would say a one or a two . project manager: Yeah . I would say two . Personally . user interface: I w I'd say two I think . marketing: It's a two ? industrial designer: For the marketing: Okay , user interface: Fanciness . marketing: and p project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: fancy {disfmarker} marketing: One being true . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: I {disfmarker} uh two , three . {vocalsound} marketing: Two . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Okay , actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing , like that . Okay so question number two was {vocalsound} is it techn technologically innovative ? So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah and the use of the rubber . marketing: {vocalsound} Use of the rubber , the use of the L_E_D_ . industrial designer: For the anti-R_S_I_ . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: The L_E_D_ use isn't particularly innovative marketing: Isn't {disfmarker} industrial designer: and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons , user interface: Mm . industrial designer: there's no L_C_D_ control , so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's sort of probably halfway . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: In some aspects it is , like we said . project manager: Yeah . I'd say maybe three . user interface: I'll go for three as well . marketing: Yeah . And I think {disfmarker} I mean it it's tough to say because we were {disfmarker} we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose . project manager: Yeah we want it simple . industrial designer: Yeah . Though it was our specification . user interface: No . Wouldn't be simple , yeah . marketing: So I mean I {disfmarker} we'll put three , but I think we actually reached our goal . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} We didn't want it any more than that . Okay question number three . Uh , will it be easy to use ? project manager: I think so . Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: Yeah very . marketing: Yeah . user interface: I think one for that . marketing: Yeah . S Yeah project manager: Yeah . One . marketing: I think it's {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: you can't really get confused with that . user interface: No . project manager: Th marketing: I mean , there'll be s we have to work out the uh number {disfmarker} the plus system . project manager: The plus number thing . user interface: Yeah that's the only thing yeah . marketing: But once that's figured out , it should be fine . industrial designer: Yeah and perhaps the turning on but {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Number four . Is this a good-looking remote ? industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . user interface: {vocalsound} It's definitely {disfmarker} industrial designer: Again I think the colour comes into this . project manager: Yeah colour will definitely be a factor . marketing: Mm-hmm {vocalsound} . project manager: I think that the logo could be smaller . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: And maybe not such a prominent way . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Maybe like at the bottom , kind of . user interface: But the {disfmarker} industrial designer: Not in {disfmarker} user interface: Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent . project manager: Oh it just had to be on there I guess . marketing: Whoops . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Should just not touch it . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Don't worry . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} This time it's the three I killed . {vocalsound} I was just wondering if it should be like flatter . Or {disfmarker} industrial designer: I suppose I've got quite big hands . project manager: I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand . marketing: Well {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: But you know what I've just thought of there now . What {disfmarker} where's it gonna sit in your living room ? Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ? project manager: Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , and then the rest is like marketing: Yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit . user interface: Yeah . project manager: round . user interface: But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand {vocalsound} . marketing: Oh . That's true . project manager: It would still be comfortable I think . We c we could handle it I think . industrial designer: Thing is like that , it's not going anywhere particularly . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: Maybe , it could {disfmarker} it could be on the bottom , so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here , so it sits up . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Like that . user interface: Oh that would be nice . {vocalsound} project manager: Ah it'd fall over all the time though . It'd be annoying . industrial designer: Uh yeah , it's less um , what's th ha . user interface: Yeah . marketing: I g If it's weighted maybe . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} 'Kay we're done designing . industrial designer: H it's got higher centre of gravity like that . marketing: {vocalsound} Details , details . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Come on . marketing: Okay . So , is this a good-looking remote ? {vocalsound} Would we wanna show it off to our friends ? {vocalsound} user interface: Three . You would though , 'cause it's bit {disfmarker} it's more interesting than other remotes . marketing: Yeah . project manager: I think , it was another colour and it was like {disfmarker} I think it'd look okay . I think maybe a two . marketing: Yeah ? industrial designer: I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , marketing: I mean I gue yeah , it's personal taste , but {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: but definitely in another colour , I'm not happy with those colours . marketing: Okay , so should we say two for that ? project manager: Sure . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Okay . Uh , question number five . What's um {disfmarker} will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ? Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy . user interface: I think we have to market it in the right way , that um {disfmarker} to say that it is simplistic . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: So people don't just see it and think , uh , this is so simplistic , I don't want to spend twenty five Euros . project manager: Yeah . user interface: We have to market it . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah it {disfmarker} the marketing will have a lot to do with it . industrial designer: And {vocalsound} the kinetic energy , shaker-style-y , whoo , user interface: And the kinetic energy part . Yeah . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} Durable . {vocalsound} industrial designer: ooh no . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Shake it and the buttons fall off . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} But you know , those'll be firmly on . user interface: {vocalsound} Don't shake {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh no the plus . {vocalsound} You're marketing: No , I guess , I don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , user interface: {disfmarker} use the zero . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Make a new one . project manager: But you're our Marketing Expert . {vocalsound} marketing: but {disfmarker} I know I am , aren't I ? user interface: I think they're about ten po ten pound , aren't they ? About ten pounds . Fifteen ? marketing: But you don't have to buy batteries . So in the long term this can actually save you money . industrial designer: Mm , yeah , that's true . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Oh . Exactly . Exactly . marketing: So we'll market it that way too . industrial designer: Yeah . Good point . marketing: So yeah I think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options , it'll {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . I would give it a two still though . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: Mm . marketing: Yeah . Okay number six . Can someone read it out ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user . marketing: Or {disfmarker} project manager: Mm . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Um yeah . So that was mainly that the statistics {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: I think it does very well . project manager: Oh yeah . industrial designer: Because {disfmarker} marketing: we said {disfmarker} industrial designer: yeah , because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing . user interface: The zap {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: And it's just {disfmarker} you won't have to think about it . user interface: yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: You don't have to look down to find them . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: They're clearly there , easy to use . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Simple . user interface: Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah I guess the {disfmarker} I think the key word there is average , 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: But they're not you and I really . industrial designer: Mm . project manager: Yeah . marketing: So . Okay so one ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Okay . Number seven . C Heather could you push it down ? Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly . project manager: We have the alarm system . marketing: Now is there the {disfmarker} is the alarm system still {disfmarker} was it implemented ? user interface: Yeah the bu when you press the alarm system , the {vocalsound} lights {vocalsound} behind the {disfmarker} and it'll vibra {vocalsound} industrial designer: It {disfmarker} Yeah marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: l lights on and , or flash as well . But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm . user interface: It'll be again in the marketing . project manager: I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up . user interface: Yeah . The light {disfmarker} it will . project manager: Or or was it gonna make a noise ? industrial designer: Yeah . But when the alarm's not {disfmarker} user interface: But {disfmarker} industrial designer: yeah . If you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: But both {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: You press the button it makes a noise right ? marketing: {vocalsound} It turns into a duck and starts quacking . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: You could s {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . Awesome . Awesome . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Oh , that would be brilliant . marketing: Here I am . user interface: I'd be tempted to {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well the thing is , if it was {disfmarker} had an alarm system , marketing: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: I mean , when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went . But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there wouldn't be any point . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So you can't see the alarm , but it would light up . user interface: It would have to be in the market project manager: I though w it was gonna make a noise . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah . Alarm , user interface: Yeah but you still couldn't see it . industrial designer: but you can't see an alarm inside uh {disfmarker} the alarm system itself . user interface: It would just be a little speaker on the back or something . project manager: Okay . marketing: We {disfmarker} oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . It w yeah . marketing: But yeah , it'll be there . project manager: Oh okay . marketing: So we can {disfmarker} we could say that {disfmarker} project manager: Whoo . Okay . industrial designer: Sorry . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: We can give it a one , because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find . project manager: Yeah , totally . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Okay . Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Sorry Heather . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: No problem , mm . industrial designer: That wasn't very clear . marketing: Question number eight . Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult . project manager: Totally . marketing: So it has to be {disfmarker} yeah , it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do . user interface: So the plu the plus {disfmarker} w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple , marketing: The plus thing needs to be worked on . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah user interface: won't it ? industrial designer: I think {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: just because it's {disfmarker} we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use . marketing: Well {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Do {disfmarker} Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an {disfmarker} just an enter button ? So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least . project manager: Yeah , so it's just like channel six , six , enter . user interface: That kind of annoys me though , when it's zero six when you have to press {disfmarker} marketing: {gap} industrial designer: Mm . project manager: Yeah but you don't have to press zeros . user interface: I don't know why . {vocalsound} marketing: You could just press six enter , user interface: Oh okay . Right . project manager: And then like twelve , enter . industrial designer: And {disfmarker} or sixty six enter , y marketing: or one two enter . user interface: Alright , aye . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah I think that's probably more straightforward . Yeah . Good {gap} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Um , okay so we can {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: I'd say w yeah one . marketing: we'll say yes it's uh one ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: Ooh . Mm . marketing: Question number nine . industrial designer: Oh . marketing: Uh , will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ , which was repeated strain injury ? industrial designer: Injury . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Um , which affected over a quarter of users . user interface: {vocalsound} Hmm . marketing: S project manager: I think so . It's like right in the {disfmarker} user interface: But if you're zapping {disfmarker} project manager: Your thumb might get a little bit uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , that's what I was thinking . user interface: yeah . I don't think it will f industrial designer: We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about . user interface: Yeah , project manager: Yeah . user interface: the biology . project manager: But it is soft . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: It's soft , project manager: And that's kind of what the um marketing: and {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Mm . project manager: the PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for R_S_I_ , marketing: And people could {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: so {disfmarker} maybe it is but {disfmarker} marketing: I don't know what other options there are . industrial designer: I think we're getting {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: that's true . marketing: Could {disfmarker} I mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: But there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: So , I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control . project manager: Yeah . marketing: So , one or two do you think ? industrial designer: I think {disfmarker} user interface: I I'd say t industrial designer: yeah , I think too . user interface: two . Yeah project manager: Yeah . marketing: Two okay . Okay number ten . Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ? project manager: Yes we did . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla ? user interface: {vocalsound} N We we can't really do that marketing: Is the yellow {disfmarker} user interface: because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: It won't stand out . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: So n it's not always gonna be the same colour . marketing: It sounds like the colour's something that we {disfmarker} project manager: Well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Gray , yeah . project manager: So it could be grey on the banana one . user interface: Yeah , could be grey . project manager: Yeah . marketing: But I mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though , user interface: Yeah that's right , marketing: depending on the {disfmarker} user interface: we didn't even rea marketing: So I think we'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the R_R_ . industrial designer: Mm . Yeah . I think this is the user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: the factor that we've been least successful in confronting . marketing: Okay . user interface: Perhaps a metallic project manager: Mm , yeah . user interface: or or {disfmarker} like that's grey , and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal . No ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: That isn't rubber . marketing: And the buttons in the middle . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Okay So , do you think that's more of a three then ? Three , four ? industrial designer: Four I think . Well I don't {disfmarker} marketing: Four ? industrial designer: what do {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} project manager: Hum . marketing: Well we have good reasons for it , so we {disfmarker} but we can still put a a four ? industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Okay . marketing: Okay , and final question . {vocalsound} Um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Current trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess . {vocalsound} project manager: I would say so . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Following that briefing we did . project manager: But maybe more like two 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit , it's just sort of naming it by a fruit . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: With the with the colours . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Like um the colour scheme names and stuff . user interface: Yeah . marketing: No , uh , are the plates interchangeable ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . marketing: I think I missed a few {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: they are ? So you can have banana and kiwi and {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: okay . Okay , so that's something that's kind of in the making too , like maybe it'll become more {disfmarker} project manager: That's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: It is . user interface: I think w yeah , I think one . Well that was our brief and we followed the brief . industrial designer: The thing is , I think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from , I don't know if you'd instantly say mango . user interface: Well we haven't got a big banana but {disfmarker} Oh yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Be like {disfmarker} user interface: No . {vocalsound} No . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Maybe if it was scented . user interface: {vocalsound} Oh that would be class . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Oh yeah . There we go . That would be great . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah we have money for that . Um {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ? industrial designer: Um {disfmarker} marketing: Yes we do . So I {disfmarker} wh what was I gonna put for that ? project manager: Oh . marketing: A two for fashion ? project manager: I would say two . user interface: Yeah . Two . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Okay , so our average there , five , six , eight , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fifteen , nineteen , twenty one , divided by eleven project manager: One point nine or something ? user interface: It's {disfmarker} industrial designer: It's {disfmarker} marketing: is {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} I don't know these things . Um , between one and two . industrial designer: Between one and two . marketing: Between {disfmarker} okay . industrial designer: So that's pretty fantastic . user interface: Close to two . marketing: {vocalsound} Um . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one . project manager: Alright . user interface: I got {disfmarker} marketing: Does that seem right then ? user interface: Yeah , 'cause we've a four to bring down . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Okay . user interface: Uh , aye . industrial designer: It seems like it should be more around two . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . Uh , should've added five . industrial designer: Do we have an online calculator ? project manager: I'm attempting to do that {vocalsound} right now . user interface: {vocalsound} This is {gap} . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Yeah it is one point nine . Ooh . industrial designer: Oh wow . Well done . user interface: Yay . project manager: Go Heather Pauls . industrial designer: Well that's excellent . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} Alright , now with that over and done with , our next step is to see if we are under budget . And um my computer's frozen . And now it's not . Okay . So um in our shared folder , if everyone could go there right now , um I'm going to um steal a cable . marketing: Sorry . Are you gonna do that ? Okay . project manager: Um it's it's um user interface: Is that the project document ? project manager: it's an Excel file . Oh . industrial designer: Production costs . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: 'Kay there we go . Um , production costs . And um I have to access that as well . One moment . {vocalsound} industrial designer: It says it {disfmarker} project manager: 'Kay so far I've added what I think {disfmarker} or what is going on ? Great . It's blinking at me . It's locked for editing . Read only . I'm gonna open up a second one then 'cause it's locked for editing . I have the original in my um my email account . marketing: Oh is it locked 'cause I'm in it ? project manager: I dunno . industrial designer: I think it just means that we can't add any more to it now . marketing: Or {disfmarker} okay . industrial designer: Have you have you completed it ? project manager: No . No , I was hoping that you guys could . industrial designer: Oh right . Okay . Okay . project manager: Um , there we go . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay here we go . So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing . So um if you can look up at the screen , um the large screen , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: oh I guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think . Okay we're using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three Euros . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Um we're using a regular chip . user interface: Oh right . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Um , it's cur it's double curved , so its curved all around . industrial designer: Double double-curved yeah . project manager: That's another three . We're already at five . Um , we're using plastic and rubber , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: so {disfmarker} Good thing plastic is free , we're at eight . Um {disfmarker} S user interface: What about a special colour ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: Are we using that ? project manager: I guess we should do it just for one kind . So it's like special colour {disfmarker} well we'll have two colours industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: right ? Well one colour for the case , one colour for the buttons . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So we can {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Um , we have push button interface , so that's inexpensive .

'S good . {vocalsound} project manager: So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros . user interface: That's good . project manager: Awesome . And back to our PowerPoint . So we've {disfmarker} 'Kay . Yes we are . So we need to do a product evaluation , again , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: which is probably um {disfmarker} I dunno . A different extension of a {disfmarker} industrial designer: Of the actual project rather than the product ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: Hmm . industrial designer: A project ? Is is {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah 'cause we're talking about leadership , teamwork . industrial designer: yeah . So wh how we actually went round uh about doing it . project manager: Yeah .

But you were allowed m creativity ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: I think so as like {disfmarker} but you were supposed to have creativ industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah and the conceptual and functional . Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess , but m industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Well we were just limited by resources really and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn't have been able to afford that . marketing: When we can down to it . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Right . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: So that did limit creativity . user interface: Creativity . project manager: Right industrial designer: {vocalsound} Just resources . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Okay industrial designer: But yeah .
