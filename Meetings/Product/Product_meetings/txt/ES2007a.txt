Oh . industrial designer: Supposed to have a great memory , we say an elephant never forgets . project manager: Mm . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: And uh dunno know why but {vocalsound} looks like nice to me . project manager: Okay . Wonderful , well done . industrial designer: Nice animal . project manager: Do you want to use the wipe {disfmarker} the m the wiper and wipe it off ? industrial designer: Okay . project manager: And Mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next ? user interface: {vocalsound} Aesthetic yep , sure . marketing: I have no idea what my favourite animal is . user interface: 'Kay , my favourite animal , marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: uh let's see . marketing: Oh . user interface: Dunno if any of you have seen Napoleon Dynamite before . marketing: It's {disfmarker} user interface: It's a liger {vocalsound} , project manager: No . marketing: A what ? user interface: a combination of a lion and tiger {vocalsound} . marketing: Alright . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Have you not seen Napoleon Dynamite ? marketing: How {gap} . project manager: No . industrial designer: No . user interface: Oh it's a hilarious movie . marketing: No . user interface: You have to see it . And and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much the awesomest animal . But you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , well done . marketing: Great .

A big fat body and big {disfmarker} and a long tail . project manager: Okay , do y do you wanna do some {disfmarker} write {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Why ? project manager: you wanna just write some words about it ? marketing: Because um cuddly . And usually cats are very friendly . Usually . And they're healing as well . They heal . And they can feel when a human's got problems so {disfmarker} project manager: Wow , so they're kinda spiritual . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: So , that's why I like cats . project manager: Well done . marketing: There we are , that's me . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Um , I don't actually have a favourite animal , marketing: Mm . project manager: but for the for th for this meeting I'll s draw a little {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . project manager: Uh . I honestly can't draw for toffee . Uh . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Really ? marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Oh that's a {disfmarker} project manager: {gap} no user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: A prairie dog ? project manager: {gap} no {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Oh a squirrel ? project manager: That's exactly what it is . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh not a very good one {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Not bad I would say . user interface: Yeah , that's pretty good . project manager: Okay , well , you got it's a s It's a squirrel , and I like them , because they're cute and stupid . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Very good . marketing: Ah . user interface: Alright . project manager: Right . Okay , so , I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Mm . Let's move on to the next page . Okay , project finance , selling price twenty five Euros , profit aim fifty million Euros . marketing: Market range internationally sold . project manager: Yeah . Production cost , ah right it's gotta be {disfmarker} can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make . marketing: Ah right okay . project manager: {gap} experience with with remote control , so talk about who who's used what . Any ideas ? Stuff like that . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . {vocalsound} At quarter to twelve . {vocalsound} user interface: So I think before we close uh , we are expected {disfmarker} I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where . I mean if you wanna go back to the last slide . Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . user interface: S marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , I think we're {disfmarker} I mean before we close the meeting , we're supposed to come up with some ideas for {disfmarker} project manager: Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: oh okay . industrial designer: Mm . user interface: Yeah . project manager: I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next , but {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , I think this is just the preliminary , get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would {disfmarker} roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe . project manager: Okay . Right , who's got experiences with remote controls then ? Pretty much everybody . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: Yeah , I think we've all got {disfmarker} marketing: Uh . {vocalsound} project manager: Um . industrial designer: Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make ? marketing: Yeah . Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: 'Kay um . marketing: Well . {vocalsound} industrial designer: T marketing: A new remote control for T_V_ . What would I like ? {vocalsound} Um . project manager: W what {disfmarker} You want it big do you want it small . Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and {disfmarker} marketing: Medium . user interface: Mm . Yeah it seems like there's like {disfmarker} there's sort of a tension between two ideas , I mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_ and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player , or something like that , project manager: {vocalsound} Video and ts hi-fi and stuff . user interface: but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something . project manager: Maybe you {disfmarker} yeah user interface: Mm . project manager: now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap . user interface: Yeah . project manager: 'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: But how do we know how much uh , I mean , how much do we have per {disfmarker} how much ? marketing: Twelve fifty . industrial designer: Twelve fifty . {vocalsound} user interface: It g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit . marketing: Each . project manager: Per unit , yeah . user interface: Cost . industrial designer: So do we have to be realistic within the budget or {disfmarker} project manager: Well at the moment we could , wa I mean we {disfmarker} industrial designer: Close pr I don't know how much it would cost . Yeah . marketing: Guess {disfmarker} project manager: 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like , and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these {disfmarker} any of these ideas are feasible or not . industrial designer: Right . project manager: So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Um . marketing: Couldn't we have like one that comes out ? {vocalsound} Like so you have one in like {disfmarker} mm industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: it doesn't have to be really thick . I mean remote controls can be thin bits . And then you have one for your D_V_D_ and you sort of slide it out , and then you have another one , you slide it out . project manager: {vocalsound} 'Kay . marketing: {gap} have slides . And then it all comes compact project manager: Okay , that's {gap} . marketing: into one . So it's not {disfmarker} you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Th that's an idea . user interface: Yeah . marketing: So you just flip them out . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Um {gap} have uh one very complicated one on one side with {vocalsound} all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , and then on the other side o {vocalsound} one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and {vocalsound} minus , and the just the mute button , for example . I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated . project manager: One side for kids , one side for adults . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} I'm not sure if that's like {disfmarker} industrial designer: Or grandma as well , you know it's like {vocalsound} what is the mute button . user interface: I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it . industrial designer: No , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold {disfmarker} like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons , but {disfmarker} user interface: Oh . project manager: Like it {gap} user interface: Oh okay . project manager: or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . Okay . marketing: That would be cool . project manager: F flip it open and you've got all the buttons , or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe . marketing: I was thinking that like a flip . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Um , oh we've got five minutes left . industrial designer: Start breaking up . project manager: But {disfmarker} okay . marketing: Okay . Um . project manager: Well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there . user interface: Yeah , we should uh {disfmarker} marketing: {gap} . user interface: I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception {disfmarker} you know {gap} stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have . Okay . Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate project manager: Yeah . user interface: D_V_D_ players , things like that . project manager: I have got {disfmarker} I think we should also have a back-up plan of {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that {disfmarker} I mean we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just {disfmarker} that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Okay . Right . project manager: What do you reckon ? See 'cause , {gap} I'm just thinking {disfmarker} bearing in mind th we've gotta {disfmarker} we have to have something that's cheap to make . user interface: Yeah , I mean {gap} . Yeah , that's true , maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote , and have it be um project manager: {vocalsound} I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker . user interface: have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use , project manager: Yeah . user interface: uh simple to use , and looks decent and {disfmarker} project manager: May w you know , maybe even {disfmarker} marketing: But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ? project manager: Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people marketing: I mean if it's if it's just like {disfmarker} project manager: or so people that uh b don't see very well or {disfmarker} big buttons for {disfmarker} touchy buttons for {disfmarker} user interface: Sorta find a niche for our remote , like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Or just one that looks really fucking cool . user interface: certain certain demographic {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Could be really light or , I dunno , something special . user interface: Yeah , no I think you're right . Yeah , rathe rather than focus on {disfmarker} project manager: Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about {gap} do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should {disfmarker} user interface: Y {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , 'cause at the end of the day if it says just T_V_ remote , doesn't say com combination with all all the r {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . I mean obviously everyone {disfmarker} we're uh you know uh sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once , but you know , that's {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Mm . project manager: Yeah , that's right . Yeah . I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well , but {vocalsound} that's not gonna happen . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} I think a flip up thing , 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this {disfmarker} well I did anyway , like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach , and you'd come and sit down and {disfmarker} ooh , the telephone's {disfmarker} the television switched on or something . So maybe something that like does have a lid or closes , so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something . project manager: Okay , like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , yeah . marketing: Yeah . But make it like really snazzy and cool {gap} people will want it . So make it {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: Yeah , it's gotta be sellable . Yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , that's true what you were saying , I mean it doesn't have to have a flip function , it can just have a lock function , so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Mm . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay . marketing: And even for kids as well . It's um it's safer for them , I guess . Like they don't flick onto channels and all that sl flick onto . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} No porn channel for children . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . Um alright , industrial designer: Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: so we've got some ideas , we've got um {disfmarker} user interface: I guess that's good good for now . project manager: Let's move on . marketing: Mm . project manager: Oops , let's close that . Next meeting , uh okay . marketing: W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for ? project manager: Industrial Designer um which is {disfmarker} marketing: Ah ri okay . {gap} these are requirement specification . project manager: Um . industrial designer: That's {disfmarker} Mm . marketing: And I'm marketing . project manager: Yeah , there you go . {vocalsound} So {gap} {disfmarker} User Interface Designer , that's that's user interface: That's me . Okay . project manager: that's you , so you gotta {gap} you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . Um . user interface: Right . Right . project manager: Industrial Designer , you are the one {gap} , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , I guess so , um whether it's {gap} what goes into the box , somehow . industrial designer: Mm . Har how it works an project manager: And in marketing {disfmarker} industrial designer: Bu marketing: {vocalsound} These are requirement specification . project manager: User requirements specifications . marketing: So what the user requires project manager: Yeah , what {disfmarker} industrial designer: Do you think our two kind of overlap , because {disfmarker} marketing: in a remote . project manager: Right , okay , yeah . user interface: Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap . marketing: I guess that's what it says . project manager: You two {vocalsound} you two are gonna be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you {disfmarker} working together . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: You're the one that's gotta go and find out {disfmarker} do th do the research , see what people want in a remote , what buttons are used more often , and s stuff like that . marketing: Mm . project manager: {vocalsound} Oh , we've been warned to finish the meeting now . Okay . Okay everyone , well done . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Good meeting . user interface: Alright , see you in thirty minutes . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: So {vocalsound} , do we take these off ? industrial designer: I don't {disfmarker}
