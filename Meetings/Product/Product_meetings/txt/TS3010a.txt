Very good . So um you can always go back . {gap} So {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} That's it . So that was two . Now next . The budget . The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros . And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it . So {vocalsound} now we have to think about what we will make . First I wanna hear from you . Uh what are your experiences with remote controls . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh I will start . project manager: F first {gap} . industrial designer: Uh {disfmarker} {gap} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Big one , they are uh not easy to use . Um I have one set and uh a remote control , when I dropped it , uh it broke . So that won't be uh our goal , I think . user interface: No . industrial designer: And uh g big buttons , {vocalsound} m uh that's easier to use than uh {disfmarker} I think . Not all the small buttons , you don't know {disfmarker} project manager: Is this positive or negative , that uh big buttons ? industrial designer: Big buttons , positive . project manager: Positive . industrial designer: All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for . project manager: Okay . What are your experiences ? user interface: Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set . project manager: Mm . user interface: And that it controls the channels and the the volume . And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote . So that you know it s it still has batteries on it {disfmarker} in it . And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it's working . And uh yeah . Uh {disfmarker} project manager: So and do they always have that ? user interface: Yeah , but {disfmarker} No no no . But I {disfmarker} my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that . project manager: It's easy to you . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: Okay . 'Kay . marketing: Uh at home we have a T_V_ , a video uh recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Thank you . marketing: That's not really ea easy . industrial designer: Help also . {vocalsound} Thank you . marketing: So it would be nice if we have one for all . And we also had a remote control for our radio set . But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . And it was uh uh v {vocalsound} not easy to use . So we n barely used it . project manager: Okay so they have too much . So next . user interface: Hmm . project manager: For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: The weight . Not not too heavy . project manager: Not too heavy . Yes . industrial designer: Not much buttons . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Bust-free . That when you drop it , it won't break . Like uh some kind of rubber on it . Or hard uh hard plastic . Uh buttons not too small . Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . Uh it between the couch and you can't find it . project manager: Yes . industrial designer: When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some {gap} {disfmarker} uh some sort of bleep . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Like a phone . industrial designer: And then you uh , hey there there's remote control . project manager: Okay . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: So , industrial designer: Next . project manager: that's {gap} . user interface: Yeah well that's {disfmarker} that are good ideas . Uh {disfmarker} Yeah well the LED on the corner , that that indicates that it's working . If you push a button . Um {disfmarker} Yeah . And looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material . So probably plastic or something . Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah I think it uh {disfmarker} from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . Or you won't sell it . project manager: Yes . marketing: And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have . And it should work with as many uh as possible of them . project manager: Okay . This is {disfmarker} It has to be compatible with other things . marketing: Yes . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: I have one more idea . Just popped up . project manager: Yes ? industrial designer: Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries . So you don't {disfmarker} won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks . project manager: No battery use . So more ideas ? user interface: Mm no . project manager: No okay . It's only the first ideas . So {vocalsound} uh what are we going to do now is {disfmarker} Next meeting is in half an h hour . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . Next meeting , half an hour . Um , what you have to do . Well look on your {gap} . And {disfmarker} Next instructions you'll get in your email .
