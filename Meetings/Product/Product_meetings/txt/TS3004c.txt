user interface: It's {disfmarker} marketing: Bonjour . user interface: It won't wake up . Yeah . I was a bit early . Like {disfmarker} What ? marketing: Why ? user interface: No , I just came in . Uh normally I was one of them . marketing: Okay . user interface: Come on . project manager: Hello . marketing: Check check check check . project manager: Oop . user interface: Why won't it wake up ? Is it on ? marketing: The power light doesn't work . You turned it off . user interface: But how ? Ah , there it is . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Okay . user interface: Uh . industrial designer: I received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials . So I'll discuss them with you . project manager: Okay , we're just going to the {gap} later . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , I received an email as well . project manager: So we're going to talk about the conceptual model . marketing: {vocalsound} Oh . project manager: {gap} marketing: Hmm . user interface: Which one was mine ? project manager: So that's me . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh okay . So {disfmarker} Uh okay . Okay , so I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes , minute . {gap} What's it called , I dunno . Whatever . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: The minutes . project manager: Okay , so we just talked about uh {disfmarker} Oh you want me to show that there or {disfmarker} user interface: No , industrial designer: Mm no . marketing: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , user interface: just tell us . project manager: we just talked about it looks . Has to look nice . Usability is very important . People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones . Um {disfmarker} It has to be very basic , not too many buttons . Light switches on if you use a button . Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility . And it has to be easy to learn . That were the things I uh make minutes of . And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text T_V_ button . That are the functions . That right ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay . user interface: Yes . project manager: So I just want to give you uh Mike again , the first uh presentation of your {disfmarker} marketing: Shall I start ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: {gap} {vocalsound} No . Okay well {disfmarker} I received an email {disfmarker} Okay . I searched the web , uh and uh I searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market . It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe , I forget it . Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . So it's very important for us to create something new . So what Michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls . Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface . Uh this uh aspect is the most important one . Uh it came out of the research . It uh is twice important as the following . {vocalsound} The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative . Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features . And then uh that uh {disfmarker} This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition . user interface: Hmm . marketing: But um {vocalsound} this is the second uh important uh aspect , and I think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative . project manager: But we already have the flashing flashing light on the {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Uh maybe maybe something new . user interface: Yeah , more . industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: We have to discuss about it s uh {disfmarker} Okay , uh {gap} project manager: Okay . user interface: Well , I'll I'll get back on it . marketing: features not uh do not exist in current remote controls . And that's very hard I think . Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . But uh that was an overall uh point . We already discussed that . Um I've got one picture . Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy . project manager: Yeah . marketing: So I took uh that part of the webpage . And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari {vocalsound} uh France and uh Italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends . This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe . But it's about uh clothes and shoes . project manager: Hmm . marketing: But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy . user interface: Spongy . marketing: But spongy , what what does spongy says ? industrial designer: Spongy . user interface: Spongy , like sponge . marketing: Spongy . Okay . {vocalsound} industrial designer: So rubber , kind of . user interface: Uh soft materials . project manager: But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . So it has to be {vocalsound} flexible . user interface: Yeah , but {disfmarker} Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . Yeah , it's something that uh it stand there . But I didn't knew uh knew what it means . So spongy means y Yeah . industrial designer: It's like a sponge . user interface: Soft , sponge . marketing: So it's also a stress-ball . project manager: That's a good {disfmarker} That's a good idea . If it's de like that . That's good , a good idea . industrial designer: Yeah , somewhat like {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , but {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: Is it a bit like like the the the the {gap} remote control ? user interface: How are you gonna make it ? project manager: R_ soft . industrial designer: Yeah , marketing: Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: I've some uh material uh information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation . project manager: Okay . marketing: Okay ? project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: What do I think ? Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , I think about changeable fronts . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front . Because it's uh it's hot . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: And uh some basic uh colour fronts . {vocalsound} Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something . Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge . {vocalsound} Uh or uh , yeah , just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh {disfmarker} Yeah , I dun dunno . We have to discuss about that . Uh y yeah . Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative . Yeah , how do we do that ? Maybe speech ? We ma must have some kind of gadget . user interface: Yeah , I'll get back on that . industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: So {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} It's very uh difficult to to to do it . marketing: Intro project manager: Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Well , marketing: Yeah , that's the problem . That's the main problem . user interface: I got f also an email from the the technology department . marketing: So {disfmarker} Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations . user interface: They have done uh research about it , and uh even more possibilities now with speech . So they recommended using it . project manager: Okay . user interface: Well {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: Okay . user interface: I'll check what they exact mean . marketing: Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then . user interface: So uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . But maybe it's cheap user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: and it's easy to implement . user interface: th that's the only problem . I d They don't say how much it will cost , so {disfmarker} Um but uh marketing: {gap} user interface: if we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well . marketing: Oh . It's mass production . So you can say , you can {gap} {disfmarker} user interface: Since you have to uh configure speech thing . project manager: But that's definitely more expensive than {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , that's that's something I dunno . marketing: Yeah . But how uh we we're gonna make many of those . So we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be {gap} . project manager: Yeah , but a telephone {gap} {disfmarker} Okay , yeah . But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros . user interface: Yeah , so uh we gotta de project manager: So uh {disfmarker} user interface: We have to decide on that . marketing: Yeah . Okay . That was this ? user interface: Mm uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Oh I got an email uh {disfmarker} And it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced . And {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} They say uh a display requires an advanced chip . And this is more expensive than all the other chips . So user interface: L_D_C_ doesn't require {disfmarker} industrial designer: it's m the most expensive . Yeah , it says in the email . The display requires an advanced chip . user interface: Okay . And speech recognition ? industrial designer: Yeah , probably too . user interface: Advanced {gap} . Yeah . industrial designer: I I haven't got anything about speech recognition , but {disfmarker} user interface: I'll I'll give you my design . industrial designer: Well it d That's that's the most expensive chip , we need . If we're doing uh if we're doing a display . user interface: Yeah okay . So we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well we can {disfmarker} I had uh to make a sort of a design . So I did some searching on the internet . I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . I think we should um {disfmarker} This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players . Mobile phones . project manager: Yeah , just modern modern but still uh basic . user interface: More modern . Y yes . Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out {disfmarker} both sides . And here you just have one , few buttons . So that's that's the main difference . But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this . And then changeable fonts , so {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: It's the most important part , I think . But {disfmarker} And the home base is something like that , something simple . Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit . Uh basic buttons . On-off , mute . And th maybe two others , I dunno . Text buttons . project manager: Yeah , maybe the teletext tel user interface: Yeah , text button , maybe there and there . And then the colour buttons , if we want it on . I don't find it very usable , project manager: No . user interface: but it's {disfmarker} marketing: No , I don't uh {disfmarker} I don't like it . user interface: Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod . They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . And uh f above ten . {vocalsound} And I think {disfmarker} industrial designer: But it {disfmarker} That's on on the display . user interface: No no . That th there is no display there . But it's on the place of the display . And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part . project manager: Yeah . user interface: So the focus is on these two parts . project manager: Yeah . user interface: So you don't see all the buttons you else need . project manager: {vocalsound} But it sounds very difficult to use . Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it . user interface: Uh well um {disfmarker} project manager: So you can't use your thumb for it . user interface: This is how it is now . Um {disfmarker} Here uh {disfmarker} Well we have volume . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: I think it is on uh on the bottom too . project manager: down there . But it's not not the best best . user interface: Yeah . Well here we have also side scrolls . I dunno if we can use that . Do we want to use {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , okay . project manager: Yeah , for volume . For volume , or a channel . industrial designer: Yeah , I've I've got something of that uh too . project manager: Yeah , why not . user interface: For volume ? Well then we can even simplify it more . industrial designer: Scroll . user interface: By just putting the volume on the side . project manager: And the channels as well . user interface: And and just channel buttons here . project manager: Oh yeah . user interface: But I think uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , or uh maybe uh {disfmarker} The channel buttons are often used . And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control . user interface: Well . Yeah , well it's {disfmarker} Basically it's it's here . industrial designer: Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom . project manager: Yeah , that's better . user interface: They're on top ? project manager: Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . Put that on the button bottom . industrial designer: Because uh you can't hold it . You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons . user interface: You mean uh these to the low ? project manager: Mm-hmm . Yeah . Except from the on-off button . user interface: Oh okay . Well , yeah . industrial designer: But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three . So maybe we can put that on the bottom . user interface: Mm {disfmarker} Maybe . I dunno , but yeah we'll {disfmarker} industrial designer: Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time . user interface: Yeah , maybe it's not easy if it's below . It's harder to zap . So I think uh it should be should be easy to {gap} . I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top . industrial designer: Yeah okay . user interface: And uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh {vocalsound} you don't see 'em very good . industrial designer: That's that's good , but {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . So the focus gets on these parts and not on there . industrial designer: Yeah okay . user interface: But uh the position of course can be different . It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: So we can uh switch these to {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half . industrial designer: No , I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top . user interface: Okay . Yeah , maybe {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: But uh we we can switch those two , user interface: Those two , yeah . industrial designer: yeah . user interface: And uh , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to uh {disfmarker} Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , right . {gap} marketing: Okay . user interface: Well that's that's my findings . So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player . And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we {disfmarker} I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open . project manager: Yeah . Yeah , that's cool . user interface: To use {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: So if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . Which won't look good on the front side I think . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: No . user interface: So that's something we have to decide on . industrial designer: Yeah , we have to keep it simple . project manager: We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look . user interface: Yeah . What we're gonna do . Okay . industrial designer: Okay , the component design . I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge . So uh this was on the web site . If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . So flashy kinda colours . Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . Not {disfmarker} Nothing square-like . project manager: Okay , so {disfmarker} Hmm , okay . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah well uh iPod is trendy . And it is well curved {gap} square . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: Square . Like . industrial designer: Yeah , but mm is uh has round corners I think . user interface: Okay . So not {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: So we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing . user interface: Yeah okay . Not uh the old uh box look . industrial designer: Yeah . And um sports and gaming device style characteristics . I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of project manager: Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the {vocalsound} remote control . industrial designer: looking , I think . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: So the colours also . user interface: Mm {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , it's {disfmarker} project manager: So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow . user interface: Black yellow control . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black . industrial designer: Yeah , mm n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public . user interface: Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . But {disfmarker} project manager: We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front . industrial designer: No , okay . That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes , but {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , okay . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: We have to use uh kind of flashy colours , I think . user interface: Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , it's cool . Yep . industrial designer: Yeah . Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue project manager: And still trans user interface: Yes . project manager: Still still transparent . user interface: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: and {disfmarker} marketing: Oh yeah . user interface: Yeah . But with all with logo on it . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Well this is a remote control , a very old one . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Then the components . The case has just a {disfmarker} Here's black . project manager: Yeah , we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material . Uh I'm not sure . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno . user interface: {gap} Yeah . industrial designer: Maybe . But anyways uh it should be transparent . We decided that , huh ? user interface: Well one of the options . industrial designer: S user interface: You can {disfmarker} Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: So you can just replace them I think . That was the idea , industrial designer: Yeah , we could do that . user interface: or just uh release one . project manager: Yeah . Just give five with them , just in a box . {vocalsound} Five different {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , uh {disfmarker} Or just uh sell different ones . industrial designer: Yeah , but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent . project manager: Yeah . Cool . industrial designer: So you can still th look through it . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: Um the buttons . Normal rubber I think . Like normal ordinary buttons . Soft . user interface: Yeah , project manager: Yeah . user interface: I uh I dunno . project manager: It it could be like a Nokia , like {gap} plastic . user interface: A more {disfmarker} Yeah , just uh {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Uh uh {disfmarker} project manager: That's better prob industrial designer: With the hard hard buttons . project manager: Yeah . user interface: I think uh rubber really has an odd look . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Yeah . The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the {vocalsound} uh the style , I think is part of the remote control itself . user interface: Yeah . marketing: It it's one uh a one uh out of one shape . Uh it's n doesn't {disfmarker} Is {vocalsound} uh a button uh um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} How do you say it ? industrial designer: Yeah , it's it's all on one level . marketing: It it didn't it i it don't come out of the {vocalsound} on the background . industrial designer: Yeah , on one level . marketing: It is in uh the c a remote control uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , I know what you mean . So we have to keep it on the one level . Like th the top it's {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , marketing: Yeah . user interface: like mobile phones . Like uh the iPod . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Uh just {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , okay . project manager: Yeah , that's cool . industrial designer: Okay , it's chos So that should be hard plastic . Then the buttons ? user interface: {vocalsound} I dunno what uh kind of material it is . industrial designer: I think . Or maybe {disfmarker} user interface: But {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material . Just only the basic uh user interface: Oops . project manager: basic remote control from normal plastic , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: and industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: the rounds of it from softer s industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: And um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Then the L_E_D_ . {vocalsound} project manager: I dunno . industrial designer: The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient . And back light L_E_D_s . project manager: Y user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} project manager: Cool . industrial designer: But I think we have to make the case transparent , otherwise the back light won't work . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: So if you put {disfmarker} project manager: Y i if you {disfmarker} The numbers could be can be {disfmarker} user interface: Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , that's right . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Or it runs the whole {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , but we can still make it transparent . So {disfmarker} project manager: They can choose . user interface: Yeah , you can halfs transparent , industrial designer: Or no user interface: or just that it's comes out a bit . industrial designer: Yeah okay . Good . And in green colour , the back lights user interface: Different , I think , also . industrial designer: or {disfmarker} project manager: Blue . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah ? user interface: Blue or red . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Whatever you want it , I think . marketing: {gap} Yeah . user interface: Uh depends on the colour of the {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it . marketing: Uh i {gap} {vocalsound} project manager: You have to choose {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , that's true . But {disfmarker} industrial designer: No , but I think there are multiple colour LEDs . So {disfmarker} project manager: Is it {disfmarker} Okay . marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: I I know {disfmarker} I dunno . Is {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ? user interface: Yeah , it can . project manager: Yeah , okay . user interface: 'Cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well . marketing: You {disfmarker} industrial designer: Maybe it's it's more impor more expensive . project manager: Maybe put some different ones in it . Doesn't matter . It's just {disfmarker} No , just some LED . user interface: I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone . industrial designer: I think it's {disfmarker} user interface: And I can change the colour of it . project manager: Okay , cool . Just make it some different colours . Blue , red and green , or something . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno . Maybe it's too expensive , but it {disfmarker} I th I don't think so . user interface: Well , we don't put put in any fancier technology yet . So {disfmarker} marketing: Hmm . industrial designer: Then uh some more technical things . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I don't know what it is , but it should be there {vocalsound} I think . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Um this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of uh things . project manager: Yeah , we have to hurry up a bit , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: W {vocalsound} So we d we just need this and {vocalsound} this transistors and resonators . There's all these kind of things . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls . user interface: I'm sure we can fit in . industrial designer: So I guess we j we just need that . marketing: {gap} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: I don't know what they do or {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah okay . marketing: Okay yeah , user interface: We just {disfmarker} marketing: you can you can change {disfmarker} Yeah . No . industrial designer: Nah , but they just said we need it . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in . project manager: Yeah , a recharger maybe . user interface: Yeah , we have to make sure to uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah okay . project manager: We still want to have a recharger , don't we ? industrial designer: Yeah but {disfmarker} project manager: Is that still the {disfmarker} user interface: Yes . Yes . industrial designer: Yeah , but it i We don't wanna have a ar an {disfmarker} How do you call it ? Accu . project manager: A recha Oh no . Uh {disfmarker} Battery . It's just a battery . Yeah . user interface: Re recharger . Base station . industrial designer: Y uh just just batteries , rechargeable batteries . user interface: Yeah , batteries . Yes , rechargeable batteries , I think's best . industrial designer: Okay . Not a separate {disfmarker} project manager: No , just rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: Okay . And uh a chip , that's this one . project manager: {gap} industrial designer: Then uh I received some possibilities . Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh {disfmarker} Like with the pulse watch . So it operates on your wrist kinda . marketing: Ah cool . Okay . project manager: But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch . user interface: So if you hold it , it gets powered . industrial designer: If you hold it . Yeah , I don't think it will work , and {disfmarker} Or we can also use solar cells . But you mostly use it indoors , project manager: It's dark in the room . No . user interface: {gap} project manager: It's just batteries , industrial designer: so {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: that's cheaper {gap} . industrial designer: Yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Um cases , flat , so uncurved . Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back . And three D_ curved is also in depth . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: So that's possible . Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons . user interface: Mm . So industrial designer: So we can't use the flat buttons . user interface: we need uh two D_ . project manager: Yeah . Definitely . industrial designer: Yeah , I think . Um these kinda materials can be used . project manager: But it doesn't really matter , we just make it plastic . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , I think so too . project manager: The scroll wheels , that's cool . That's for the volume . industrial designer: Yeah , scroll wheels um {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , that's good . We can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: But I think just the volume is enough . user interface: {gap} Uh {disfmarker} For channels it's not handy , project manager: Okay . user interface: because you scroll too fast . industrial designer: And uh the L_C_D_ . So we need uh the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an L_C_D_ . marketing: Mm {disfmarker} project manager: I don't think that's an opportunity . Just skip it . Because we don't have time for that to to put it in . industrial designer: Okay , then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip . So th so the regular chip . Because we use scroll wheels . project manager: Yeah , okay . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: And um {disfmarker} Yeah , that was it I guess . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Uh are are we using a a rubber case , or {disfmarker} project manager: Oh just sk industrial designer: We haven't decided yet . project manager: Maybe you have to skip that one as well . It's {disfmarker} user interface: Uh I don't think a rubber case looks {disfmarker} industrial designer: L marketing: Uh but we have to do something about the trend . industrial designer: Yeah , i it it should be soft . You said so ? marketing: The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh . user interface: Yeah , okay . That {disfmarker} Uh fruit and veg , or {disfmarker} marketing: And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two . user interface: Yeah , fruit and veg can be just the covers . marketing: Uh yeah i Just {disfmarker} Just on front . user interface: So you can {gap} the the spongy {disfmarker} yeah , I dunno . I can't imagine a soft remote control . project manager: No . marketing: Neith uh I don't like it uh neither . project manager: No . {gap} {vocalsound} user interface: I just can't imagine it . industrial designer: {vocalsound} So just hard plastic ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , I think . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Titanium . It's mentioned here uh . industrial designer: Titanium , uh I think it's too expensive . project manager: But maybe the form has to be a bit different . Not the sh the square form . Just a bit industrial designer: Yeah , project manager: more rounded . industrial designer: you can make it curved or mm round . But just in two D_ , not in depth . project manager: Yeah . Yeah , that's right . user interface: Okay . project manager: So {disfmarker} We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these . What exactly . Because we have to know it . So the energy uh is the recharger . user interface: {gap} project manager: We already know that . Just a normal battery . user interface: Yeah . We have batteries . project manager: Okay . The chip-on-print is a normal one . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Regular . project manager: Okay , the case is just a plastic one . industrial designer: Yeah th yeah , the chip is the the regular one . project manager: Yeah , re Yeah , regular . Yeah , okay . Yeah , regular . industrial designer: You have the simple one , regular and advanced . So it's b should be regular uh the second . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: I think I'll just check it . project manager: And we need a plastic case , with a scroll wheel . {gap} user interface: Yes . project manager: That's pretty much it . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: And a flashy light . user interface: User interface concept . project manager: So uh I'm not sure . But we do I don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment . But {gap} user interface: I dunno either . industrial designer: Mm . Or should we do it in the next meeting ? user interface: Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board . project manager: Yeah . That's for the next one . industrial designer: So we should did it here ? project manager: That's for th user interface: So we're staying here ? project manager: Uh that {disfmarker} I think that's the next next meeting . industrial designer: Or should we do it in the next meeting ? Okay . project manager: But you definitely get a specific instruction . {vocalsound} user interface: Okay , so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: But th think about something that's more rounded . Just {disfmarker} And more {disfmarker} It has to be {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , uh I dunno . But the iPod and etcetera , M_P_ three players , mobile phones . project manager: Uh a bit . Just just on the top or on the bottom . user interface: Just a bit cur Okay , I'll see if I can see any of those . project manager: Maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this . O um if you draw it like this , you get a {disfmarker} What the fuck is it ? {vocalsound} Okay . Mm {disfmarker} Doesn't work . {vocalsound} You see what I mean ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} What ? project manager: If I draw here {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It draws about four centimetres lower than {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Oh . Okay . project manager: Nah okay . Just {gap} . Maybe you can make it like this . And this is all the wheel for volume . So that you just um {disfmarker} It's all rounded , so you can do uh turn this one . industrial designer: Like a very big scroll-wheel . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Maybe , I dunno . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: Okay , so we {vocalsound} have this at the moment . industrial designer: I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted . user interface: Yeah , you {gap} {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , so user interface: Yeah . project manager: we'd have this . Is that okay ? user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: that's a little problem , of course , as well . industrial designer: I think it's probably better . project manager: And {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . Only if you use your finger . user interface: Yeah , maybe you just have to make it uh {disfmarker} That's not scrollable too easy . project manager: Like this . And uh what's the channel choose ? Where do we uh put that ? Still on the bottom industrial designer: I think in middle . project manager: or {disfmarker} user interface: Uh wh what is the middle part ? project manager: That's the numbers . user interface: Numbers , okay . industrial designer: Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle . user interface: Yeah , I agree as well . project manager: It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other . user interface: Use the dz project manager: Because you already have the volume here , so {disfmarker} You can also put it here one butt and the other one there . Next to each other . {gap} back and forth . user interface: Yeah , that's right . project manager: So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . Because you have to hold it as well . industrial designer: Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below . project manager: But that's not {gap} want to zap very quick , so {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , I think uh zapping is the highest priority . industrial designer: Yeah , okay . project manager: Yeah ? Is this a opportunity , user interface: And then you use those uh {disfmarker} project manager: or you don't want a different {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , of course uh . industrial designer: Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other , so {disfmarker} project manager: Why ? industrial designer: Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up {disfmarker} project manager: But still the next {disfmarker} It's still the next one . Doesn't make {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , and down button is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If you put them {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , but fo from left to right is exactly the same . It ma it doesn't make a big difference . user interface: Yeah . I I think it's {disfmarker} It's it's obvious , I think . industrial designer: But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing . marketing: Yeah , that's not not {disfmarker} It's not al uh always the same . project manager: But it's exactly th industrial designer: In uh {disfmarker} On most on most remote controls . marketing: Every remote control's uh different . user interface: Yeah , I think {disfmarker} industrial designer: So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time . project manager: I dunno . I {disfmarker} You already have the volume on the side , user interface: No , uh I think {disfmarker} project manager: so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake . user interface: Yeah . project manager: So it's uh {disfmarker} user interface: I think it's s so simple industrial designer: I dunno . user interface: you just {disfmarker} project manager: So but that's for that's for you , industrial designer: Okay . project manager: 'cause it's {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , so hmm . What did {disfmarker} What else we have to discuss about ? I dunno . user interface: Think we need to work uh thirty minutes again ? marketing: Yeah , we have to care that it r uh looks really new . Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control . project manager: Yeah . marketing: 'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside . project manager: And the LED . user interface: No , you have uh {disfmarker} It is {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , but i i it should be round in in shape . user interface: Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} user interface: You have to look at that image of the iPod . marketing: Yes . Okay . user interface: More that uh kind of style . marketing: And a bit uh {disfmarker} user interface: Not not the old grey black {disfmarker} project manager: Uh {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: Some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Where you can put a ve Uh we have {disfmarker} If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo . project manager: Yeah . Uh the logo was has to be on there . Yeah , that's right . marketing: Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ? Uh five or something ? project manager: Yeah , five . Let's give five . user interface: {gap} marketing: Or more or {disfmarker} user interface: Maybe you can buy separate ones and uh {disfmarker} marketing: And um uh {vocalsound} uh buy the product . You buy , you get one . And uh basic . user interface: Yeah . Um marketing: Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project . user interface: I think {disfmarker} Yeah . That's your choice , I think huh . industrial designer: No , tha that will be {disfmarker} project manager: So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? Is that is that a good good opportunity ? user interface: Yes . project manager: So you could put it like that , industrial designer: Yeah , so top down . project manager: okay . industrial designer: Hmm ? marketing: Yeah , you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station . industrial designer: Do we have to design that w as well ? marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Uh I'm not sure . industrial designer: The docking station ? user interface: Yeah , I think so . industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: But th Yeah , that can be very simple . Least . marketing: Yeah , we can b It c it could be just just a square , just a packet . industrial designer: Yeah , just a recharger . user interface: Yeah , just where you're around something . Li Yeah , we had one example . industrial designer: But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well . user interface: Mm . Mm . marketing: Yeah , user interface: Which w marketing: but that's a round one . Maybe we can choose then . user interface: Here you see one that's very round . industrial designer: Oh yeah , okay . user interface: So I think that can be all kind of shapes . project manager: But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit . That's all . industrial designer: Of the remote control ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah {disfmarker} project manager: Just round it up {gap} . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , so y you don't want uh this uh like the iPod {gap} . But {disfmarker} project manager: No . Yeah . Yeah . user interface: More rounded . Yeah , I think it will just look like more like this one . Since it's {disfmarker} This is also rounded . project manager: No , just just the corners . user interface: I think i marketing: {gap} user interface: Yeah okay , tho those are al already a bit cornered . Mm {gap} {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah , but we can we can do all kinds of uh {disfmarker} As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes . project manager: Shapes . user interface: Yeah okay , but then we have to think of something totally new . industrial designer: Not in depth . Yeah , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah , if if we want to make it kind of , yeah , new . user interface: I've uh {disfmarker} I had a lot of picture of old ones . And all curves have already been done . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: It's a bit annoying , isn't it ? marketing: Yeah . What do we do wrong ? Hmm . Just just more like this and not uh a square . user interface: Yeah okay , yeah well {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah , but we could do a lot of , lot more curving . I would do it {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . I know we can do a lot more , but {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , it {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Like in this kind of shape or {disfmarker} marketing: Uh it's very annoying . Okay . industrial designer: I dunno . I dunno if it's handy . user interface: {gap} I think it will only look more like the old remote controls . marketing: Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: This ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: The olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing . user interface: Yeah okay . But uh I had a lot of pictures {disfmarker} Oh I can show you here {vocalsound} what the old ones look like . industrial designer: Mm . user interface: Curves , curves . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: You've more {gap} there as well . industrial designer: Yeah , okay . user interface: It wasn't very small one . {gap} very simple . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: That is for elderly . project manager: So we have to make a decision , what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have . industrial designer: Yeah , I don't know . marketing: Yeah . user interface: I think if w My opinion . If we just uh take the iPod , and the same look . marketing: Yeah . user interface: So uh light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours . And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: No rubber buttons or something . Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: And you have the scroll button inside . {gap} Okay . user interface: Yes . Just a simple scrollb marketing: Yeah . project manager: But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ? Of {disfmarker} Skip that one as well . user interface: Doesn't have to be . project manager: Okay . Yeah , it's cool . industrial designer: Yeah , though that's a trend . If we want to make it . But yeah , I'm not a Trendwatcher , you are . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Uh the t the trend is project manager: Rubber spongy . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: spongy and fruity . user interface: Yeah . No . Spongy marketing: But yeah . industrial designer: Spongeball kinda . user interface: and {disfmarker} marketing: It's not not a lot of trends I uh I found uh {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , so we have s still one minute left . So just {disfmarker} marketing: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Okay . Yeah , marketing: It {disfmarker} The th th industrial designer: I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff . project manager: No . marketing: Yeah . project manager: But I I think it's still for older people . You j still have older people . It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that , like f Whatever . Just you have a normal {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , but we're we're aiming at a young public . marketing: There is one {disfmarker} There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original , and I hope we can uh make it look not like the iPod itself . It must have uh uh uh a very different {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , {gap} idea . But {vocalsound} you're {disfmarker} If you look at the way remote controls are now {disfmarker} project manager: But i it is it is it is already fancy . Because of the lights on the bottom of it . That's already fancy . user interface: And if you make it look like the iPod {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , they're all the same . user interface: Yeah okay . So that's already a very big change project manager: Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the {vocalsound} wha what's it called uh scroll wheel . Make it in in yellow or something . Just like the colours of Real Reaction . user interface: compared to {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: Ye yeah . Well uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , we could do that . user interface: Could . marketing: Uh yeah , but uh if you the f uh front , the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow . project manager: Yeah . user interface: No , I think {disfmarker} Oh . project manager: It's right . user interface: Think the scroll wheel {vocalsound} won't be very big . Since if you put it uh somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big . project manager: Yeah . user interface: So it will just be a small small scroll wheel . So it won't uh stick out much . project manager: Yeah . Maybe the ones we are going to draw there . Maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has {vocalsound} if it can work better than this . Because it doesn't work properly . So maybe you have to ask her . user interface: Yeah okay . Well , marketing: No . user interface: maybe we can just open images there , and I'll paint and paint . project manager: Okay . Yeah . That's probably {disfmarker} user interface: I'll be able to do a better job . marketing: If you set the pen yeah , he will draw here . Doesn't work . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay , so just finish it . So we make it a bit like m that one probably . Yeah . Is that okay ? marketing: Yeah , I'll see it . user interface: Bu Yeah , I agree more like iPod {gap} . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay , only the colour and the flashy light and the {disfmarker} user interface: Yes . project manager: We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition . user interface: Just a {disfmarker} Speech . Yeah , do we s keep that ? Yeah , I think {disfmarker} project manager: Or keep that ? It's okay . But you'd definitely need a industrial designer: S {vocalsound} user interface: Well uh project manager: advanced chip . user interface: then it w {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh yeah , I don't know . Yeah , I think so . marketing: Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: And we we have to build in a microphone and {disfmarker} user interface: Well that's very easy . We already have uh the beeping of the {gap} home station , industrial designer: Yeah , and I do I don't know anything about that . user interface: so {disfmarker} industrial designer: I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition , marketing: No . user interface: Uh strange that I received {vocalsound} the information about that . industrial designer: so {disfmarker} marketing: Oh that's hard . But {disfmarker} project manager: So {disfmarker} marketing: Uh the ma the main points I I I uh just said . We have to be original and uh technological innovative . Becau project manager: Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well , marketing: Yeah . But {disfmarker} project manager: okay ? user interface: So marketing: {vocalsound} Ma user interface: shall we {gap} it open then ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: So we can put all the {disfmarker} project manager: The function of that in there . Yeah . user interface: Okay . project manager: And we need a {disfmarker} Probably we need a uh advanced chip then . industrial designer: Fine . Yeah , we probably do . project manager: But it doesn't say anything about it , user interface: Yeah . project manager: does it ? industrial designer: No . user interface: Oh yeah , I {disfmarker} marketing: But we don't have any f information about the cost . user interface: No . marketing: We started with information about the cost was now th user interface: I just I just received the {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , uh I have I have some some information about the cost . But just a about the chip . user interface: Yeah . marketing: And how much is the chip ? The the the {disfmarker} industrial designer: I don't know how much , but {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit . industrial designer: Just in inexpensive or {disfmarker} user interface: This is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question . marketing: And how how does it work ? Is it {disfmarker} user interface: Doesn't say . Just {disfmarker} You say record , followed by your question sample , and after a few seconds the answer uh sample . Because uh {disfmarker} So it works like uh good morning remote control , and then the remote control says good morning . project manager: It doesn't has to say anything . Just {disfmarker} You have to just talk to {disfmarker} marketing: No . user interface: Yeah uh th that's just {disfmarker} It's a {disfmarker} marketing: Does it say does it say something back ? project manager: Okay , we have to stop it now . So just {disfmarker} user interface: No . Yeah , it {disfmarker} Well that's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it . project manager: Okay , that's a r That's that's a advanced {disfmarker} industrial designer: But i it's a separate chip . user interface: I dunno , but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: Yeah , I don't know anything about this , marketing: Um {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , we just decide not to put it in , industrial designer: but {disfmarker} Nah . project manager: because it's too difficult . industrial designer: I dunno . {vocalsound} user interface: Well it it would be would be a good feature feature . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay , we just put it in , because it's a good feature . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: We have to stop now . user interface: No no worries about the cost , etcetera . project manager: Okay , just {disfmarker} user interface: And there's a chip in it that will {disfmarker} project manager: We have to stop it now . user interface: Okay . marketing: Fine .
