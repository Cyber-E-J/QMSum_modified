project manager: Good . industrial designer: Beep . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh . project manager: So well uh user interface: What ? project manager: welcome everyone . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Um as you may have noticed I uh user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: created separate folders because it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder . user interface: Yeah . project manager: I don't know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in the right folder , which is for now the detailed design meeting . marketing: That's new one ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: We didn't make any uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh , we should save that one . {vocalsound} user interface: Oh in {disfmarker} project manager: Then I'll move this one . user interface: Didn't we just do that ? industrial designer: Yeah , save in the folder . Save as project . user interface: Oh . project manager: Oh no , this is just one big document , so you can leave that wherever it is . industrial designer: Oh , okay . project manager: {vocalsound} And we have a evaluation left here . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Hmm hmm . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Agenda . project manager: Well not main documents this time . Oh uh yes . user interface: Hmm ? project manager: I have it open myself I guess . Um well the detailed design meeting {disfmarker} Huh ? We're finally getting somewhere hopefully . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Um what are we going to do ? I've opened it already . Um I'm still going to take some minutes , and if I'm right , you two are going to give a prototype presentation ? industrial designer: Oh , sorry . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {gap} project manager: Aren't you ? user interface: We could . {vocalsound} project manager: Yes , you are . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: And uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria ? marketing: Yep . Yep . project manager: Good . And we have a correct agenda . And uh then we have to look at something which is less nice , the finance uh aspect , whether we can afford what we have designed , user interface: Oops . {vocalsound} project manager: and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation , how did we work together and what are the results , and how happy are we with those . Okay , well finance uh will be later . Now I'd like to give the word to you two . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} Well uh industrial designer: Get up stand up . {gap} just {disfmarker} user interface: we made a prototype . industrial designer: 'Kay . user interface: We first start with the overall uh {disfmarker} This is about the total remote control . industrial designer: View . user interface: We made it green . industrial designer: Just example colour , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: so uh there's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype . user interface: It's a fresh colour . And uh the screen light blue . Oh uh this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under . And the R_ and R_ logo , it just says R_ and R_ now , but uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay ? user interface: Any questions so far ? {vocalsound} marketing: Big microphone . industrial designer: {gap} yeah , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible . marketing: Oh okay . That's the place where it's going to be , not the size . {gap} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Uh well , it's an idea in a {disfmarker} so . user interface: Oh y you {disfmarker} perhaps you should make it a bit big , so people know it's there and uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Do not forget it . user interface: Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: To function it it doesn't really have to be sm uh big of course . user interface: Hmm . marketing: Yeah , okay . Of course . industrial designer: The microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button . marketing: Mm . Mm , th yeah . industrial designer: Okay um marketing: Small . industrial designer: {vocalsound} we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work . Uh using the scroll button on sides uh y uh I uh um {gap} {disfmarker} user interface: You push the scroll button industrial designer: Yeah , you push the scroll button user interface: and it's claps out if there's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available . For example uh T_V_ settings , uh remote settings , et cetera . user interface: Remote settings , et cetera . Yeah . industrial designer: So uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button , uh as you can see {disfmarker} oh , it's here , just push it in , uh the menu comes out like this and uh i it all becomes visible . Um {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . And you could also touch it so that it comes out , industrial designer: Yeah , that's c user interface: and and use the the the scroll thing as a {disfmarker} with your fingers . industrial designer: Yeah . Indeed . user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Okay , um it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu , uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button , and the opportunity to use the teletext , whi which is used uh {disfmarker} which should still be used and we think that it's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu , but in uh {disfmarker} Yes . In an apart uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: So a separate button for for text , industrial designer: In a separate button , yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . project manager: okay . user interface: Perhaps we should use the teletext sign in p yeah . industrial designer: A sign , yeah , just like {disfmarker} Okay , indeed . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay , user interface: Forgot . {vocalsound} industrial designer: we can uh modify that later . Okay . Would you like to make any comments about next uh {disfmarker} user interface: Uh well , this is the total interface uh that f of the L_C_D_ screen . Uh the numbers , which is pretty straight forward . We put ano an an extra button in . We can erase it , but {disfmarker} It's the button where you can switch channels . {gap} just when you are one and you go to two , you can {disfmarker} or if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button . Yeah , that one , yeah . industrial designer: Previous page , yeah , indeed . user interface: It has a name . And uh uh we put that in , industrial designer: Oh my God . user interface: I thought it would be handy there . Uh this the one number or two numbers button . Below that , the page and the sound . And uh in the middle the the mute . Uh battery indicator . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's quite large . user interface: It's {vocalsound} it's a bit big . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} And this is the uh the on off uh knop , the stand by uh knop . Or at least it should look like it . And the options uh of teletext . industrial designer: Okay . You can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't uh taking uh much uh {disfmarker} uh it's taking much part of the screen , so it's very uh {disfmarker} when you uh {vocalsound} when you use it , doesn't uh become irritating to see . user interface: Huh . industrial designer: 'Cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu . 'Cause people regularly uh read from left top to right down , project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: so {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . Well this about it , I think . industrial designer: Okay . Huh . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Thank you . Looks good . user interface: I will put it back on the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} on the nice green . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: And I just missed when I was typing {disfmarker} The R_R_ stands for ? industrial designer: {gap} user interface: That's the logo of the {disfmarker} project manager: Logo , okay . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . It's th th right now it's only R_ R_ , but uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Full screen . project manager: I would have recognised it if it were the right colours of course . {vocalsound} marketing: Shit . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Alright . {vocalsound} user interface: Sorry . {vocalsound} marketing: 'Kay . {gap} project manager: Okay , the evaluation criteria , user interface: Oh full screen , yeah {vocalsound} {gap} . industrial designer: Huh . project manager: huh ? marketing: Evaluation . 'Kay , my task was this time to put up a questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we {gap} {disfmarker} requirements from the {disfmarker} of the users . My name , my job , okay . industrial designer: My name , my job . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: The methods . Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false , user interface: Right . marketing: like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps . One means absolutely not true , seven {gap} {disfmarker} means true . user interface: Yeah . marketing: The three important things of refa {vocalsound} {gap} are uh from th of this year is {disfmarker} are , industrial designer: {vocalsound} Sorry , user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: you used the PowerPoint {gap} {disfmarker} marketing: is the remote control fancy enough , user interface: Yeah . marketing: is it in innovative enough , and is it easy enough to use . And then evaluation itself . Uh . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: What ? {vocalsound} marketing: So . industrial designer: Bling . marketing: Okay . user interface: Yeah . marketing: First question . Is the design fancy enough ? user interface: Well {disfmarker} marketing: Project Manager , what do you think ? project manager: Well it's {disfmarker} looks fancy , especially with the green colour . And the the curves which we decided , user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: But does it {disfmarker} project manager: huh ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting ? user interface: It uh {disfmarker} oh it's in the background . Oh . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Now uh the single curved idea was uh {disfmarker} Yeah , okay , you ge um {disfmarker} user interface: Y you should make uh a sideways uh view . industrial designer: Yeah . The sideways view , uh that that that ma user interface: It will be , I guess . Oh , we can {disfmarker} industrial designer: Ho not that pen . {vocalsound} Not that pen . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: Oh marketing: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Well user interface: g {vocalsound} I would {vocalsound} {disfmarker} smart board . project manager: it might work one time , huh . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Suppose so . user interface: {vocalsound} Uh can I draw here or uh {disfmarker} marketing: Think . user interface: Ooh . industrial designer: Ah . Oh my God , marketing: Yeah , yeah , you can . user interface: So it would be uh something like this from the side , but with a bit of uh curve here , industrial designer: it works . user interface: right ? industrial designer: Yeah , that's the single curve indeed . user interface: Yeah . So if you v flip it like this . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Yep . user interface: Here's {gap} yeah . industrial designer: That's not very {disfmarker} i it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom . Uh make it uh rather thick on the top , because uh on the top it has uh the screen , which takes uh in some uh space , and the batteries can be located over there , user interface: Yeah . So you just make the back of this part a bit bigger , industrial designer: so uh {disfmarker} user interface: so that it lays a bit o industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top ? industrial designer: {gap} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's a bit of problem maybe . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: No . marketing: With two batteries , the whole print plate and t and top , and if you're holding it quite a lot I think {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . I think yeah , the battery should be in here , because it's just nothing , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: so if you could {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay , indeed . Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay , but we have to rate uh these things now ? user interface: 'Cause otherwise I think i marketing: Yeah , we have to rate . project manager: Okay . marketing: Is it fancy enough ? True is one , false is seven . So fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people . user interface: I think it does . industrial designer: I think so . user interface: I if you don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't like it . industrial designer: It's pretty fancy . marketing: I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , I have to agree , all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {gap} you get th project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: it's only design . user interface: I think it does . project manager: Yeah . marketing: And the design . project manager: Well I think uh especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . I don't know whether older people will use it , but {disfmarker} project manager: Very new thing . Well {disfmarker} Fancy {gap} the old people will . marketing: So {disfmarker} user interface: I would make it a two or something . industrial designer: {gap} marketing: A two ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {gap} It's true , it's a one . {vocalsound} Very fancy . user interface: Huh ? Alright , it's a one . {vocalsound} Oh it's a one . {vocalsound} project manager: No , it's a two . {vocalsound} Little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves , huh ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , I n used {disfmarker} I wouldn I should use that one , but it doesn't {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: But it's a one uh {disfmarker} Maybe uh {disfmarker} marketing: Okay , no it's two ? True is a one . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Very true , is it very true or isn't that true ? project manager: Well I'd say two on a scale {disfmarker} user interface: Well they think it's very true , but uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: It's very true , because we designed it to be very fancy , marketing: Yeah , I think two . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , industrial designer: so {disfmarker} user interface: but {disfmarker} industrial designer: It's very fancy , I think . user interface: We should perhaps {disfmarker} industrial designer: Have you ever seen a remote control like this ? project manager: No , okay well , that's true . {vocalsound} industrial designer: No , okay , user interface: That not . industrial designer: so so it's fancy . marketing: That's fancy enough . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay , one two . marketing: Then ? project manager: That doesn't matter that much , so make it a one . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . Let's give it a two . Is it innovative ? user interface: I think it is , marketing: Enough . project manager: Yeah user interface: because it has an L_C_D_ screen , a mi microphone . project manager: m industrial designer: And uh uh the scroll is rubber , user interface: It's from rubber . marketing: We have for the search function . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: so s Eno enough to {gap} I think . marketing: The scroller a bit {disfmarker} I think it's it's a one yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} It's a one I think . industrial designer: {gap} marketing: True . Also huh uh-huh {disfmarker} the buttons , are they easy to find ? That was a big requirement of the old people . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , because they're right on your screen . So you can use the b the the arrows . They're right on your screen , industrial designer: Huh . user interface: so I don't know where you'd search . industrial designer: With the ones {gap} marketing: Are all the buttons easy to find ? Not only this buttons , all the buttons . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Well , I think they are . The options are it {disfmarker} uh little bit harder , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: but if you touch the options then it's uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Take a harder look , yeah , sure . marketing: I think th it's industrial designer: It's easier than the regular uh remote control . marketing: easy t project manager: Yeah , and you use these buttons the most , marketing: Yeah , I think this is easy now . I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to project manager: huh ? So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: No they're not , but they're they're they are easy to find . marketing: to handle . True . industrial designer: Yeah , they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls marketing: I would rate it a {disfmarker} user interface: Oh . industrial designer: where you have to uh find out what {disfmarker} which sign or icon means on uh every button . marketing: Yeah , okay , that's true , that's true . user interface: Yeah . project manager: So industrial designer: So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most {disfmarker} project manager: which {disfmarker} marketing: But that's that's vantage of L_C_D_ screen , you can have text . project manager: So which number are we going to fill in ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: I would say yeah . industrial designer: I think it's uh it's a two , at least . user interface: Yeah . Yeah , project manager: A two , yeah ? user interface: you can make it a two . project manager: Two , three and {disfmarker} industrial designer: It's not perfect , but {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: what do you think ? marketing: {vocalsound} I think it's a three . industrial designer: A three ? project manager: Okay , so we have two , two , three . industrial designer: And why is that ? marketing: I personally think , because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use , it has to be easy to find right away . I I think if you have the button at the right , I don't think you can find the option button that easy . user interface: Yeah , but you don't have t have to use the button on the right . You can touch it . marketing: You can touch it . user interface: Yeah . You you can touch options . industrial designer: It said bo both the options . marketing: Yeah , okay , but you have y then you have here s written option on here , the teletext button , user interface: Yeah . marketing: right ? industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Okay , then okay , good . Then I think also two , yeah . user interface: You can touch options project manager: A two , okay , user interface: and it's comes out . project manager: because we have to {disfmarker} industrial designer: A two , a two . marketing: Yep . user interface: {vocalsound} The uh the um {disfmarker} Below . project manager: It's the box below it , industrial designer: Uh the next question the next question . project manager: huh ? industrial designer: Oh my God . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: Otherwise we have two results in one question . user interface: {vocalsound} It's different . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , next question . marketing: It's easy to use , as well for younger as elderl elderly people . user interface: For young people I think it's easy to use . project manager: {gap} marketing: Young means sixteen to forty years . industrial designer: Yeah , I was {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: And elderly from forty eight to their death . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: I think it's {disfmarker} industrial designer: I think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} In the entire mankind . project manager: Okay , you're very enthusiastic about your own design , marketing: Also if you're sixty years old {disfmarker} project manager: huh ? industrial designer: Yeah , but because it has the regular uh controls , li uh as you can see in the screen now , and uh you don't have all the other options uh always uh on your screen . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So it's t I think it's really easy to use . You want these options to {disfmarker} marketing: Also project manager: As well for the for the older people ? industrial designer: Uh sure . marketing: Yeah , as well as your {disfmarker} if you're fif sixty years old , you're holding one of those things in your hand {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah , but they they don't want the uh extra options , right ? marketing: No , but we're going to th make this f for a all kind of people , user interface: So {disfmarker} project manager: And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ? user interface: Yeah , okay , marketing: so it it it has to be {disfmarker} user interface: but so they could {disfmarker} Uh I think it is . If they read a manual . project manager: Because that might {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} If you read the manual , user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , alright . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Perhaps that is one of the most uh {disfmarker} marketing: {gap} always . project manager: M maybe that's the most user friendly and easy to use . user interface: Because it it's not it's not it's it's not uh difficult . industrial designer: Uh because a lot of {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: You say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition , industrial designer: Channel one , channel four , yeah . user interface: then you say the question and the answer . And that's everything it does , the speech recognition . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them . user interface: Yeah . I think it would make it uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , I think it does . marketing: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Because all the people who can't uh {disfmarker} user interface: I would make it two . marketing: Also two ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Uh a two . Sure , two . marketing: Not a seven for this {gap} ? user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Three ? industrial designer: Oh . project manager: I'd say three . marketing: I would also say three . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , so we have three three two two user interface: Oh . You ? project manager: or {disfmarker} industrial designer: Two . user interface: Oh . project manager: So what are we going to do ? {vocalsound} user interface: Well {disfmarker} Two and a half . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , a three , I see . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Three ? No . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Give me more . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Another question . marketing: Remotes overwhelmed with buttons . user interface: No . industrial designer: No . project manager: No . marketing: No , that that's that's {disfmarker} user interface: But um I mean , marketing: yeah . user interface: that's definitely one . marketing: Tha that's a one , I think , that's definitely a one . industrial designer: That's definitely our uh {disfmarker} user interface: Oh nee , oh seven is it ? It is . marketing: No ? user interface: Yeah , uh marketing: Oh yeah . project manager: Yeah . Yeah , user interface: the remote score . industrial designer: A false , yeah . project manager: but I think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad , marketing: Yeah , I think isn't , this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed . project manager: because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything from the results , user interface: It's not overwhelmed . Yeah . project manager: so {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , indeed . marketing: True . project manager: Okay , a one , user interface: Yep . project manager: because we designed for that , huh ? marketing: Remote control has uh colours that different {disfmarker} that meet different target groups . user interface: Yes . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} user interface: 'Cause we make them in different colours , project manager: Yeah . user interface: so that they uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: is optional . project manager: Yeah , and I though w we had about single colours , marketing: That's true . project manager: but you can also make uh a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing , user interface: Yeah . That it that it looks like wood , like something , yeah . industrial designer: Huh . project manager: can't you ? marketing: Also with rubber ? user interface: Uh I think you can . project manager: Whether it looks like wood , it isn't w it isn't wood marketing: Yeah , okay . project manager: but {disfmarker} user interface: It it feels like rubber , project manager: You can make a print on rubber , user interface: but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: can't you ? Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So that's a one then , user interface: Well but then when you scratch it it does come off . marketing: Yeah ? project manager: huh ? {vocalsound} marketing: That's a one ? user interface: So that's a bit {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , it is it is harder to marketing: Okay . project manager: Do you have many questions ? marketing: Uh I have {disfmarker} industrial designer: to like {disfmarker} project manager: Oh , okay well {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Oh we have time . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Geez . project manager: Yeah , but we have {disfmarker} We also {disfmarker} We have to get to the money . {vocalsound} industrial designer: We're getting paid . We're getting paid . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} The material used is spongy , user interface: {vocalsound} What ? marketing: that that's uh that's a one , that's m rubber . project manager: What {gap} spongy . user interface: Yeah , yeah , it's very spongy . industrial designer: Uh . marketing: Yeah , user interface: Oh marketing: I th think it's not the most spongy thing . user interface: but not {disfmarker} it's not very spongy , because it's hard rubber . I think it's a three . industrial designer: Yeah , it's a three , project manager: Uh-huh , yeah . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible , user interface: Hard but {disfmarker} Yeah . You can {vocalsound} break it . industrial designer: because it has a L_C_D_ screen . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Hard to lose , marketing: Remote control is hard to lose . industrial designer: yeah it sh and it's easy to find . user interface: Y yeah , you could you could call it . marketing: Y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old . If first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh {disfmarker} set the microphone , and then you lose it , then you have lost it . user interface: Yeah , y you can lose it , but it isn't hard to lose . marketing: It isn't hard , no . I think I think this is a two , personally . user interface: Two . That it's hard to lose ? marketing: No . user interface: Yeah , it it is {disfmarker} there's the {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Isn't hard to lose . project manager: so isn't hard to lose you . {vocalsound} user interface: it's a six , you think ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: Isn't hard to lose , yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Isn't hard to lose . user interface: So it's a two . Yeah , you can lose it , so I don't {gap} {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . You can't lose it . user interface: you can make it a three I {gap} {disfmarker} It does have an {disfmarker} a built in function . marketing: Or if you're you're sixty years old , your demands {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , but a har A hard to lose is good . So it should {disfmarker} this question should be hard to lose . It's difficult to lose it . user interface: Nee . Hard to lose . Oh right . industrial designer: Yeah , this this is hard to lose . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: It is hard to lose . Yeah , so then this is {disfmarker} it is almost true , industrial designer: This {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: A two . marketing: I think {disfmarker} yeah , I think also . user interface: so a two . project manager: A two . industrial designer: Two , yeah . project manager: Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} industrial designer: And most all because of the option to {disfmarker} Whoa . marketing: Huh ? user interface: Ooh . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , it's okay . That happens above also . But maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal , user interface: Oh . industrial designer: Uh . marketing: Yeah ? Oh , okay . project manager: but {disfmarker} Yep . Oh , marketing: No . project manager: it isn't , user interface: Oh well , project manager: well okay . {vocalsound} user interface: it doesn't . industrial designer: {gap} put the cor cursor {gap} on the {gap} . project manager: Remember . marketing: {vocalsound} Okay okay okay . industrial designer: Click . marketing: Remote control mainly be sold to younger people . user interface: I think it will , industrial designer: True . user interface: yeah . industrial designer: True . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah ? True ? Very true ? user interface: Uh well industrial designer: Uh yeah . Uh {disfmarker} project manager: There . user interface: I {disfmarker} a marketing: No , I don't think very true because the colours . user interface: a two . {vocalsound} marketing: We have the colours . Um we have the buttons is {disfmarker} aren't that that much . industrial designer: Materials , yeah . marketing: Nah , the material isn't that {disfmarker} user interface: It's it's much more younger . industrial designer: Uh okay . So ma uh make it make it a two . marketing: So I don I think I think it's a three . project manager: Well I think it's it's uh a lower number , so better because w we designed it for young people especially , user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , project manager: didn't we ? user interface: I think it's a two marketing: but I uh {disfmarker} user interface: but {disfmarker} marketing: Okay , okay . project manager: What do you think ? marketing: I think because {disfmarker} project manager: Questions ? industrial designer: A two ? I think it's two . I think it's two too , two too too . project manager: Two . Uh-huh . {vocalsound} marketing: yeah ? user interface: Two two two . {vocalsound} Let's make everything a two . marketing: In the features ? project manager: Dissatisfy younger people . Um {disfmarker} user interface: Younger people . It has {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well perhaps not . user interface: What did {disfmarker} marketing: Because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing . user interface: Yeah . Well that {disfmarker} it doesn't . industrial designer: Well , n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that , user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah bu but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: but it's for a remote control I think it i {vocalsound} it would satisfy those needs . user interface: I think they like the speech . You could call to your uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , the speech possibility , user interface: yeah , and the screen , industrial designer: the colours . marketing: L_C_D_ screen and scroll . user interface: yeah . industrial designer: Scroll options , yeah . marketing: I I think they'll be quite met with their expectations . project manager: Yeah , but those are more fancy functions , not not really many features or something . user interface: Right , that that that {disfmarker} marketing: No . project manager: It has relatively few features , user interface: those are features . marketing: It's three features , basically , project manager: with {disfmarker} marketing: the L_C_D_ {gap} touch screen is feature . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: No , marketing: The microphone is a feature . user interface: aren't the features {disfmarker} the microphone's feature and that you can change the channel's feature , and that you can change the volume is feature , project manager: Yeah . user interface: and that you can change the options of the remote , uh uh something like that . Yeah . project manager: Ours had other features with {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , okay . I think {disfmarker} yeah , and then you have the audio settings , channel setting , video settings . industrial designer: The easy volume up button . user interface: Those are features . industrial designer: Remote {disfmarker} younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume . {vocalsound} Turn uh turn up the volume . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} Enough features ? marketing: So I've chos I shou I think it's it's it's a one . Personally , yeah . I think once you've {disfmarker} 'cause you have the channel features b uh you have the uh screen features , audio features , the {disfmarker} you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll thing extra . project manager: Okay , you think one , user interface: Yeah . project manager: what do you think ? user interface: I think two or three . project manager: You . {gap} three , yeah . industrial designer: Two . project manager: I'd say three , so two it is then user interface: Yeah . Yeah uh a two a two . {vocalsound} Just another two . {vocalsound} marketing: Make it make it a two . project manager: or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: One two three . {vocalsound} marketing: Or make it uh a fucking two . user interface: We like two . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Right . marketing: You can see the remote control is {gap} R_ and R_ . user interface: Yeah , there's R_ and R_ in front . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Uh . project manager: Yep . marketing: {gap} Has {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Uh it's not the colour , so maybe you should make two , but it has R_ and R_ . marketing: oh yeah , do did have {disfmarker} nah y you have the black one . user interface: Yeah . marketing: And we'll probably make also a yellow one . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , project manager: Yeah , user interface: but not R_ and R_ yellow I think . project manager: maybe maybe two . Well m th but the logo is on on the front , industrial designer: Okay , true , yeah . marketing: Maybe two . project manager: so {disfmarker} a two , yeah , user interface: One d on i it's the colours and the {disfmarker} marketing: X_ marks spot . {vocalsound} project manager: that's {disfmarker} marketing: And the menu is avail that is available is easy to use . {vocalsound} user interface: I think it is , but I don't know what you think . industrial designer: {vocalsound} I think it's easier to use than a regular remote control , because when you push on the options menu , you get the the the various options uh entirely explained . Entirely explained . marketing: Yeah , tha that's so true . Mm-hmm . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button . marketing: Mm-hmm . Yeah , uh {disfmarker} user interface: And you can navigate easier , because wi with the {disfmarker} you have to push the the the arrows and {disfmarker} with a normal T_V_ uh remote . industrial designer: Yeah , you can navigate . Uh . marketing: I think that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use it . industrial designer: You're not satisfied , okay . Let's start over again then . {vocalsound} marketing: No , I'm not not convinc . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Let's make a different remote . Well {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Let's go th for {vocalsound} inhalation of air] user interface: Menu . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: I think it would be a t yeah , two . user interface: A two ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} A two . marketing: Now lower . {vocalsound} project manager: Oh , well that's that's pretty good , user interface: We only have twos . {vocalsound} project manager: huh ? industrial designer: Oh yeah , I think so . Yeah . user interface: Uh just twos . One three and a few ones . industrial designer: And three . marketing: So okay , we have one three , a one , that that have to got up . {gap} user interface: Two threes . marketing: Two two two two two . user interface: We m mostly have twos , so it's pretty good . marketing: So two , yeah . The average is a two . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: The average . {vocalsound} marketing: That is quite good user interface: Yeah . I think so too . industrial designer: Yeah , I think so . marketing: in my opinion . That {gap} user interface: We can be happy . marketing: Ooh . industrial designer: Save . {vocalsound} {gap} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: Ooh . user interface: What is it ? It's like a bug or something . industrial designer: It's a fly . user interface: A fly , yeah . industrial designer: Oh m user interface: A f butterfly . marketing: Top . user interface: Yeah . That's it . marketing: Okay . project manager: That was your evaluation uh show , marketing: Yes . project manager: okay , so we don't have to calculate anything because of um these results . user interface: {vocalsound} Sure . marketing: No , it's two . The average is two . project manager: Okay , good . user interface: It's good . Yeah . project manager: Um let's see {disfmarker} oh , it isn't asked to save but it did already {gap} industrial designer: Yeah . Exactly . marketing: Yeah , I uh uh I uh saved it . project manager: And this {gap} Everything okay . Well , the next part uh might be a little bit difficult to do in a group , but I am willing to try it . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: Because we are going to look at the finance and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Redesign . No . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} And um I'm not sure if I put it in the project folder . {gap} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} project manager: look on that . Um and we're going to calculate the production costs , and if they are uh under or at twelve Euro fifty , user interface: Yeah . project manager: we're good , and if they're not we're going to uh re-design , user interface: Yeah . project manager: but we have to do that uh very very quick I think , user interface: So we're going to erase features or something . project manager: yes . Um I don't know if I user interface: Do you have the cost project manager: put the Excel sheet in the user interface: or uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Let's hope . project manager: n not in the industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} f fifty five Euros . project manager: folder . I think it's user interface: {vocalsound} We're going to be here at eight o'clock . {vocalsound} project manager: I think it's still in my own documents folder . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: We're goin still going to be here at eight o'clock . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: No . project manager: Oh shit . user interface: I doubt it . Perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the Excel sheet . marketing: Yeah mm yeah , maybe . project manager: So {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No , marketing: The microphone . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: it was in my uh my information , so uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: It i It wasn't too much . marketing: Yeah ? {gap} user interface: Yeah . marketing: maybe you're going scrap scrap it . industrial designer: As well as the L_C_D_ screen . Whoa . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , well this is it . user interface: Well , if it doesn't work {disfmarker} project manager: Um maybe I could ask one of you to uh fill it in , so that I can also uh take minutes , user interface: I want to fill it in , but uh {disfmarker} project manager: and uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions . marketing: No prob . Ah . user interface: But you should uh direct {disfmarker} marketing: Count it ? Li like write it be project manager: Well we have to count some things and we have to think about some things . But you have to fill in this column , huh ? industrial designer: Count it . You got Excel to count . {vocalsound} user interface: The number of {disfmarker} marketing: {gap} project manager: No , uh count uh number of functions , because for every button you have to pay {disfmarker} industrial designer: Oh okay . project manager: and there are different screen shots , so {disfmarker} or different different screens , industrial designer: Well I dra marketing: Ah , okay , cool . industrial designer: uh Danny , Danny , I'll do that , marketing: Huh ? Yeah ? Oh , yea yeah , you design it . Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: because I draw the uh project manager: so {disfmarker} user interface: We've got a battery , one or t two batteries , or not ? nee one battery , with two small batteries . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but it's it's more about the energy source , huh ? Do you use a hand dynamo , a battery , kinetic or solar cells ? user interface: Yeah . I would do a battery {disfmarker} we do . Right ? marketing: Solar cell . No project manager: We'll wait . user interface: A battery . One battery , industrial designer: No , no solar cell , no no no no . marketing: it took a battery ? user interface: right ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: No hand dynamo . marketing: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} Electronics , simple chip {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Hand {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: We have {disfmarker} user interface: advanced chip , right ? marketing: No , we have sample speaker . industrial designer: On advanced chip . marketing: But b al but we also have sample speaker , do user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . user interface: so this one and this one . Uh we ha we have um single {disfmarker} marketing: Oh , we already on nine . user interface: what ? Are we ? Oh yay . marketing: We have double curved . user interface: {vocalsound} The single . industrial designer: Single nee single curved . Double curved was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional . marketing: Single . industrial designer: But it isn't three dimensional , user interface: Oh the the {disfmarker} industrial designer: it isn't curved in a l marketing: This one is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: it's not going to work uh people . We have rubber . marketing: This one is curved like this , project manager: I'll just fill it in . marketing: right . It's curved like this . industrial designer: No no no , project manager: Um rubber indeed ? industrial designer: single curved is like this . Uh that's the only curve you made , marketing: Yeah , bu what {disfmarker} industrial designer: not th uh curved like that . That's uh {disfmarker} marketing: Oh , but we have curves like it and it . user interface: Thirteen ? marketing: There are two curves , right ? Oh , okay I understand , I understand . user interface: With a scroll wheel , industrial designer: Huh ? user interface: right ? Is he integrated ? industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Rubber . user interface: No , eh ? I don't know . industrial designer: Yeah , marketing: Push button . No , we don't have push button . industrial designer: we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button , because when you push it and you w it won't just pu uh makes possible to s user interface: Oh yeah , right , we want it to {disfmarker} it's not it's not {disfmarker} no . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Not going to work ? marketing: L_C_D_ display . user interface: Yep . industrial designer: Okay . Okay um {disfmarker} user interface: Fifteen , oh , too bad . {vocalsound} Oh but with special colour we have . A special form , right ? industrial designer: But now button supplements . We don't got the button supplements . user interface: Oh , we don't have any buttons , so {disfmarker} marketing: Eighteen and a half , user interface: Yeah , we need to uh marketing: damn . industrial designer: Damn . marketing: We have to lower it with six points . user interface: No , uh we have fifteen and {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Twelve and half . user interface: oh , right . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: We could lose the curve . industrial designer: Nah . marketing: We could use {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , I would lose the curve . industrial designer: We could lose the scroll wheel . You could make it just a regular scroll wheel . user interface: But you can't push it , so you have to tap . industrial designer: Yeah , if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh {vocalsound} with uh the button . user interface: Yeah , alright . project manager: Yeah , I think that will be our best bet . user interface: So normal scroll wheel ? industrial designer: Normal scroll wheel . user interface: And I think we should lose the curve . marketing: I think we should scrap the sample speaker . industrial designer: Lose {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: It's four pri it four units . user interface: Yeah , but if you {disfmarker} would i it is a new feature , it it's something special . industrial designer: Okay , so we don't exactly need the single {disfmarker} We don't need a curve . marketing: But w d wha user interface: No , the curve doesn't really {disfmarker} industrial designer: 'S possible to lose curve . marketing: Curved then it will be square . user interface: No , then it will {disfmarker} won't uh stand up from the table . Then it would just {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . {vocalsound} marketing: Was that {disfmarker} does that mean to it , single curve ? industrial designer: Yeah , that's meant with scr uh with s curve . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: The curve is uh in a dimension . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: If you make it a flat one , s n it's no curve , you got no curves . user interface: So {disfmarker} We would lose this one ? industrial designer: Yeah , okay . marketing: Yeah , but tha that that only is one . user interface: Yeah , we could s yeah , a bit . industrial designer: No , two . marketing: No , one . user interface: Sixteen point three . industrial designer: Oh , okay , indeed . marketing: So we don't {disfmarker} user interface: So we still {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , we also have to {disfmarker} industrial designer: Is it possible to make {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ? marketing: No , otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen . user interface: No ? Ma y you just can't do that , or uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: No . project manager: And what did you change ? You changed the uh scroll wheel user interface: We changed th project manager: and {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , and the single curved to uncurved . marketing: Single curved . project manager: Oh , but it's just one marketing: Flat . Yeah , so that does doesn't doesn't that mu I think {disfmarker} project manager: point , so maybe you should should uh {disfmarker} user interface: No . marketing: Scrap sample speaker ? project manager: Yeah , you should you should drop the speech recognition . industrial designer: The sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points . marketing: That that's uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , but it's t marketing: Yes , four points . project manager: And then you can keep the curve . user interface: Yeah , but it is uh it it is a new feature , project manager: Or can't you ? user interface: it is something special . industrial designer: Yeah , uh becau uh when you lose the {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap ? user interface: I don't know . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: F You have to {disfmarker} we have to scrap four points . user interface: Yeah , that's difficult . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Or make it on a hand dynamo , but {vocalsound} I don't think that will work . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ? industrial designer: No , that's {disfmarker} no . user interface: Uh . industrial designer: Make it w uh when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood ? user interface: {vocalsound} We could make it titanium instead of rubber . industrial designer: {vocalsound} You don't make a remote control of {disfmarker} Ah . marketing: Yeah , project manager: Yeah , marketing: it it i project manager: mm-hmm . marketing: Yeah , it also {disfmarker} uh it also takes one point less . project manager: Yeah , but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed , user interface: Oh . Oh can I ask something ? project manager: yes ? user interface: What is special colour ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: Is that the wood uh wood uh {disfmarker} marketing: I think it is . user interface: this , we have to have that one too ? industrial designer: It isn't . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: What ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: but it's only a half . But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker . marketing: Yeah . Sample speaker . industrial designer: To knock the sample speaker , yeah . And sample sensor . user interface: Th then we still have too much marketing: Yeah , okay , user interface: if we use the uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: But m yeah , course , marketing: three . Point three . industrial designer: but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , we we scrap that one ? industrial designer: What we'll have . {vocalsound} marketing: Huh ? industrial designer: Let's make it thirteen or fourteen . {vocalsound} user interface: See , a po marketing: Point twelve {gap} . user interface: three . {vocalsound} We need point three . {vocalsound} marketing: That's a scroll wheel . {vocalsound} user interface: Uh it's a colour . Don't make it wood . industrial designer: A colour . marketing: Yeah , but a wood {disfmarker} user interface: Make it uh {disfmarker} marketing: we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood . user interface: Yeah , but it's it's special colour , is it a all kind of colours ? industrial designer: Yeah , special colours , fruity colours . user interface: It's also green or uh {disfmarker} marketing: Is it also {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: no that that's just normal colour {disfmarker} fruit colours . user interface: Yeah , but it's a special colour than just rubber colour . marketing: Normal colours , yellow {disfmarker} user interface: You have to add something to the rubber to make it green . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: You don't say here's green rubber . industrial designer: They don't sell green rubber plants . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , but then I d I don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half . industrial designer: Alright . user interface: Yeah , you can , you should {disfmarker} you have to lose {disfmarker} marketing: But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display , we have to scrap uh user interface: No , it is the scroll wheel , I guess . industrial designer: No no no . marketing: s advanced chip . No then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make ? industrial designer: If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen marketing: Five ? Then we have two . user interface: A push , marketing: S user interface: yeah . marketing: touch . industrial designer: {vocalsound} then it's possible to make . And then you can {vocalsound} and then you can add to the colours . marketing: Then we can make {disfmarker} add two colours on it . Yeah , two colours {gap} it . industrial designer: Special c user interface: Switch colours . industrial designer: Okay , if you lose uh {vocalsound} if you lose the {disfmarker} user interface: It was such a great idea . {vocalsound} industrial designer: You lose this one , you got eleven point five marketing: They can add two colours . industrial designer: and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve , for example . marketing: But the colours . Um how ma uh the colours like l she told , is that all the colours we add or {disfmarker} industrial designer: How d uh uh how many colours ? user interface: What do you mean ? industrial designer: Special colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make p marketing: Yeah , but we we we are {disfmarker} we have yellow , red , uh black , titanium . industrial designer: Yeah , but uh when you use more than one colour , it's a special colour . user interface: Oh . marketing: Ah okay . user interface: But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , industrial designer: I suppose . user interface: 'cause you have to add it . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , but the rubbers alls original black . user interface: Yeah , so you always lose the special colour . You co you could make it always black , like normal remote . marketing: Yeah b Yeah , but we're gonna make it yellow {disfmarker} uh red , and then you add {disfmarker} you have two special colours on top of the one we have now . industrial designer: Nee we we also want to make ano another colour . user interface: Oh right , yeah . Yeah , we should u marketing: Yeah , but m user interface: Yeah . We have to make this like four or five or something . marketing: Yeah , user interface: That's what it means . marketing: because we have more colours than only black . project manager: Yeah , but isn't it per remote that you pay ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: I {disfmarker} then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special {disfmarker} project manager: Half ? user interface: Oh right , yeah . Is it per remote ? project manager: I think you pay half per remote . user interface: Yeah . Yeah , that's right , project manager: So each remote with a special colour . user interface: and you {disfmarker} one colour per remote . industrial designer: Yeah , indeed , yeah . user interface: So then it is one . industrial designer: You don't need four of those {vocalsound} uh four of those special colours in one in one remote . marketing: Yeah , okay okay , true . True , true . user interface: No . project manager: I hope . {vocalsound} marketing: We have two points spare . project manager: So the battery , marketing: Nee one point . project manager: we have um advanced chip on print . user interface: One . So it would be curved , single curve . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Because of {disfmarker} thing {disfmarker} user interface: Or not ? project manager: Yeah , well you can at least make it curved again . industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: So y you just can't make a nice remote . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , single curve . project manager: Because that was very important , user interface: It's too bad for the speaker . project manager: huh ? So it's curved , it's still that {disfmarker} so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker . user interface: Should we change that tha that that's a one if not , marketing: Mm yep . project manager: We dropped the scroll wheel . user interface: or not ? Could you copy it ? project manager: And the rest is the same , user interface: And make it uh {disfmarker} project manager: huh ? Am I right ? marketing: Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped . project manager: Yes . user interface: The entire uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh . Huh . marketing: Yep . user interface: Perhaps you can then copy page or so . Ooh . No . Oh you you made the entire {disfmarker} could you {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . Undo , undo . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Oh industrial designer: Undo . user interface: not {disfmarker} Well {gap} . industrial designer: So , 'kay . user interface: Would you ? industrial designer: Twenty minutes ? user interface: By the {disfmarker} Perhaps you can save this one , and then copy or something . Add it copy page . Select all . project manager: No , but you c yeah . user interface: Alright , something went wrong . marketing: Tap . project manager: Okay , but this this new remote we can afford . {vocalsound} user interface: It doesn't work . Let's forget . marketing: It should've work . industrial designer: Okay , so you had this list at start ? {vocalsound} project manager: Hmm ? No , I hadn't . industrial designer: Alright . When did you receive this list ? project manager: I just received it . industrial designer: Ah okay . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Oh project manager: They don't work so hard at the finance department . {vocalsound} user interface: ignore that . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well , so {disfmarker} industrial designer: Ah okay . I suppose this is a {disfmarker} user interface: Too bad . industrial designer: Okay , so we lose the scroll wheel , user interface: Yeah . The microphone . industrial designer: the s project manager: Yeah , and that's it . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: And the microphone . user interface: A and we changed something , I guess , or not ? We {disfmarker} Oh no . marketing: Yep . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Twelve Euro fifty . Um and did you try to make a new design , or what were you trying to do ? user interface: Yeah , I tried to copy that one , but it didn't work . project manager: It didn't work . user interface: So we could fix it like tha that it's like this . {vocalsound} project manager: Hmm . Strange . user interface: You could select it all , but then you can't erase . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Strange . project manager: Oh , you can arrange {disfmarker} industrial designer: You can only re erase ? user interface: Erase . industrial designer: Oh . user interface: When you saw th li uh {disfmarker} Earlier when we selected it , w I couldn't erase anything . industrial designer: Uh , no . project manager: Hmm , can't you then just say copy ? industrial designer: Bling . project manager: New page . Paste . Yes . industrial designer: Ah . project manager: {vocalsound} Select none . {vocalsound} user interface: Just tap somewhere . industrial designer: {gap} just up somewhere b uh besides it , marketing: {gap} just tap somewhere . industrial designer: right . project manager: Okay , user interface: Yeah . project manager: and now you can erase . user interface: I don't think I can , but uh we can try . industrial designer: Uh , we already try . project manager: Well it should be possible . user interface: Oh , yeah , project manager: Oh no . user interface: no , ha-ha . project manager: Well you can draw over it with white uh pen . {vocalsound} marketing: No ? user interface: Yeah , we tried it earlier . project manager: Oh . user interface: It's very much work . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Sorry . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Well but that's also useful for the evaluation , because I think uh we have a prototype now marketing: Evaluation drops . project manager: which we can afford and uh we only need to draw a little bit to get a good uh design . Doodle . And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time . marketing: And erase the mic . user interface: Yeah , goodbye mic . industrial designer: All I need is no mic . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Let's see , we can save this now . user interface: Oh , I already erased half of the line . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Bon chance {vocalsound} project manager: And move back to here . user interface: Too bad , oh . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Like this ? project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Still looks nice . project manager: And then all green . Okay , well thank you . user interface: Oh , that's erase . marketing: Looks like a iPod . project manager: Oh , no {gap} . industrial designer: No , project manager: Hey , but you can erase that . industrial designer: add {gap} {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , that's a bit weird . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Uh-oh . user interface: Oh , now I'm {gap} line . industrial designer: S Difference between lines and text and the pen . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Right . {vocalsound} marketing: Oh . All I need is {gap} mic . {vocalsound} project manager: And you can't erase this ? marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Hmm , strange . user interface: No , project manager: Okay , well uh user interface: it's weird . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: just leave it at this and quickly save . marketing: Station page . project manager: Um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation . industrial designer: Huh , looks fucking boring now . {vocalsound} project manager: We just did {gap} our project evaluation . Um well , I think I can sit for that since it's almost my final slide . Um what did you think about uh the process ? How satisfied are we ? industrial designer: Deadlines were sometimes very short . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Bu but stressful . You think , no , my presentation isn't ready . industrial designer: But {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: And stressful . marketing: I think we {disfmarker} it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Now we worked through each other , project manager: And you could ask things . user interface: Yeah , you had information I didn't have marketing: something he said {disfmarker} user interface: and then uh {disfmarker} marketing: yeah , and you had information I also had , user interface: Oh right . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: so some some things I had in my presentation , they already told , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: And for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present what , huh ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: so {disfmarker} project manager: And uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: So yeah , that {disfmarker} I don't think that is the best way to work at {disfmarker} for such project . project manager: Yeah . user interface: No . project manager: So you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , no , or maybe session of five minutes together or something , and then work separate . industrial designer: Yeah , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: but but why not work here together , for example ? user interface: Yeah , you could {disfmarker} industrial designer: Why should we be separated from each other in those difference {disfmarker} uh different rooms ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . Well , probably to simulate the whole working uh process , user interface: I think so too . Yeah , but then you can work together too industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: huh , th {gap} you can't have a meeting uh for several weeks . user interface: when {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah m yeah , like she told . Then you can work together too by mail or by , I dunno , chat , something , project manager: No . user interface: A chat would also be uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Huh , oh right . marketing: but now we're completely separated from each other . I don't think that was the best way , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: But the technology was uh fantastic . {gap} user interface: Well , marketing: Yeah , the technology's okay . user interface: I I don't really like the board , it doesn't really work great . Sometimes I think {vocalsound} . industrial designer: Work now ? marketing: Yeah okay , but I don I do I think becau that's because {disfmarker} industrial designer: Perhaps it is e user interface: It does work , but sometimes it doesn't erase or it doesn't uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so and to uh {disfmarker} and lay it next to that keyboard over there . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So you can draw uh {disfmarker} see it over th on the screen . marketing: Yeah , like the f like a plotters or something , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: yeah . Yep yep yep yep yep . project manager: So you don't think the SMARTboard is is really useful user interface: But {disfmarker} project manager: or {disfmarker} user interface: Well industrial designer: {vocalsound} It's useful , but not m user interface: it is useful , marketing: Yeah , it is useful , but {disfmarker} user interface: but it doesn't really work all the time . marketing: No . user interface: Th the pen doesn't {disfmarker} industrial designer: Because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below . user interface: The line is a bit off . project manager: Yeah , so it's maybe a bit unnatural also . user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: Alright . marketing: Yep . user interface: you can point to where you want the line to be . But {disfmarker} industrial designer: The project uh {disfmarker} because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh {disfmarker} have , you didn't have time to uh {disfmarker} to make a very uh qualitati qualitative uh presentation . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So you used uh this uh the different PowerPoint presentations uh in which you put your uh material in the {disfmarker} Oh . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: That wasn't me . Uh {vocalsound} so um user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Wasn't me . project manager: the means , we discussed the smart board , and what about uh this digital pen ? user interface: I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I I used it , marketing: I didn't use it at all . {vocalsound} user interface: it it was {disfmarker} you can use it , it's quite handy I think . project manager: Yeah , well industrial designer: But I didn't {disfmarker} I uh {disfmarker} project manager: I use it as a a normal pen and and and only you use it to uh get it on the computer , user interface: Yeah , I used it to y to {disfmarker} project manager: huh ? user interface: Yeah , it did work pretty well . industrial designer: I used it too , but {disfmarker} oh well . user interface: I don't think why you would want to use it actually , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: I didn't use . industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: but it it does work . {vocalsound} industrial designer: because it shou marketing: No {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: To make some designs , marketing: It is it is {disfmarker} industrial designer: it is very easy . marketing: yeah , it is easy for {disfmarker} to design something and then load it in your computer . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , and then you can show it to everybody . industrial designer: But to write it th yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: It doesn't really write normally . marketing: Yeah .
