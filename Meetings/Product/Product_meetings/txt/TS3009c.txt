project manager: Okay . Uh door is closed . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Well , let's begin . Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting , we'll have to hurry up . marketing: I'm listening . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Right . project manager: Um well I'll start with the presentation again , the agenda . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Great . project manager: Yo . So . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} This one I think . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Uh yeah . Well alright . Um well , I'll show you the notes . It's not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: but I'll show them . We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design . Um {disfmarker} Then we'll have to dec decide about the control , the remote control concepts . I've put a f uh a file in the project management folder , which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: So {vocalsound} this time we exactly know what to decide about . marketing: {vocalsound} Alright , great . project manager: And then we'll close again . industrial designer: Alright . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} Well these are some examples , but we'll talk about them later . We'll {vocalsound} first look at your uh presentations . Alright ? industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Walter will uh start again this time ? marketing: Yeah , great . project manager: Yo . marketing: Alright , Trendwatch . project manager: 'Kay . marketing: {gap} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Right . I will speak about uh latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , and uh things we must not do . project manager: 'Kay . marketing: Uh the trends . {vocalsound} It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling . Uh this because of our last model was very functional , but {vocalsound} it uh people didn't like that , so our new mo model must be very good-looking . That's uh something you uh have to take a look at . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . Alright . marketing: And uh the feeling has to be very great . Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great . industrial designer: Alright . marketing: Um there's a minus uh two times here , because this is the most important point . This is uh two times as less important , project manager: Less . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: and uh same for this one . {vocalsound} Um , technological technological innovations , that's uh regarded very highly too . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen , uh speech uh acknowledgement , as we uh talked about earlier . project manager: Well , yeah . marketing: So we have to have uh something like that , like we uh {disfmarker} project manager: L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts . marketing: Right . {vocalsound} Uh the last point is easy to use . Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself . I don't know who's uh who's going to look at that . industrial designer: Easy to use ? project manager: Well , easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah ? industrial designer: I think that's your ta user interface: {gap} project manager: Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use . marketing: Yeah , I know . project manager: Well we have to choose one of them . {vocalsound} marketing: I think we have to go for the first one . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm . marketing: It's the most important one . So {gap} we have to uh take that one . project manager: Okay . marketing: So it it {vocalsound} it isn't very important that {vocalsound} that it works easy . user interface: Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} But {vocalsound} it has to look great . project manager: Yeah . We'll we'll look at uh {gap} . industrial designer: You {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , yeah , marketing: We'll see . {vocalsound} industrial designer: you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway , so ease of use {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's not a very comp complicated device . marketing: Yeah , right . But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say {gap} wow , that's real great uh great concept . project manager: 'Kay . industrial designer: Alright . marketing: Alright . Uh these are the new colours of this year . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: So it must be very bright , very colourful . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: People like this . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: So we we have to think uh in this direction . project manager: So {disfmarker} marketing: So i set your mind to it . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Well {disfmarker} marketing: Findings ? Fashion update ? Fruit and vegetables are cool . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Uh you think ? marketing: I am told . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: So {vocalsound} we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , well {disfmarker} user interface: Bananas . marketing: Uh furthermore uh material , that's your part , should be very strong . I was thinking of something like uh {vocalsound} well uh iron plate over it , industrial designer: Mm . marketing: maybe in a colour or something , project manager: Yeah . marketing: that looks so f really flashy but it it is also strong . industrial designer: {gap} project manager: B marketing: And that's uh also for the younger public . project manager: Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . Th this year it's fruits but next year it's it's something totally different . marketing: Yeah , that's great . user interface: Yeah . marketing: But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin . project manager: Yes . marketing: So it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily . project manager: Yep , alright . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Well , the don'ts . Older people like dark colours and simple shapes . Well we don't want uh older people , user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: we want young people . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} marketing: So uh we're gonna turn that around . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Alright . marketing: We're gonna have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours . Right ? project manager: Wood is popular . Aha . marketing: Okay . We don't want wood . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , among the old people , yeah . marketing: Old people . So , that's it for me . project manager: Alright . Nice , uh well {gap} show us . industrial designer: Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design . Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties . This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device . And the materials ? Um I have heard several things , so I uh I'll have to change that on the way . But uh the case ? Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic . But uh as you indicated uh it should be strong . marketing: Yeah , we should change that . industrial designer: It should feel strong . So maybe plastic is not uh sufficient . project manager: Well maybe it it it is , industrial designer: We should move to uh something {disfmarker} project manager: but it doesn't look strong . So maybe {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well yeah . Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough , but it doesn't have a really really tough look . So {disfmarker} marketing: No no no . project manager: But we still have to look at our price of course . Because uh if we want an L_C_D_ uh window etcetera uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . Also {disfmarker} Yeah . Mm-hmm . But we'll return to that . project manager: Yeah ? industrial designer: Uh the buttons of course rubber , I think everyone agrees . And electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic stuff . The chips made of silicon , I guess . I think that's the best uh way to do it . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Then I've uh {vocalsound} had a few findings , made a few findings . Uh the target audience product style . Um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like , as you said , uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that . They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style . But of course that's not our uh things this . So this is things we must not do . project manager: Yes . industrial designer: And then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people , which is of course our uh group , the people we aim at . Um under forty five years old . Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours . Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said , that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking . marketing: Mm . Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: But they like soft materials , uh so we might uh we have to consider that . And also they like curved round shapes . So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want . And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device . But uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device , so we don't really have to consider that . project manager: Sports uh , they're uh that uh are accessible on on your L_C_D_ uh window uh user interface: Soccer fronts . {vocalsound} Mm . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {disfmarker} Huh ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm . project manager: That's nice . {vocalsound} user interface: Hmm . project manager: All the {gap} results ? industrial designer: Well I also have um several examples of uh styles , marketing: We keep coming back to the fronts . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Uh {vocalsound} these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: It was not very uh interesting uh , very classical looking , project manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Nai . Uh no . industrial designer: but that's n that's not what we want . user interface: Hmm . industrial designer: We have these kind of things . I don't know what exactly they are . marketing: {vocalsound} Fruity . {vocalsound} Fruity . industrial designer: It looks like {disfmarker} Well you know uh you recognise the shapes , project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: it's very primary colours , uh bright colours and uh round shapes . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: You also uh {vocalsound} see uh this device , it's not very round and {disfmarker} Fruity of course . Yeah , it uh {disfmarker} project manager: It's t terrible . industrial designer: That's true . project manager: Alright . industrial designer: And uh well round shapes , primary colours . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: You can see it all here . And of course uh this famous device . project manager: Hmm ? industrial designer: I think as you know something uh some devices like this . project manager: Yeah , alright . industrial designer: So to give you an idea of uh {disfmarker} marketing: Well it's got a strong look , this . Yeah . industrial designer: This has a strong look . Although it's plastic , it's it's grey to to to give it iron look . marketing: Yeah , it still has a strong look . project manager: Yeah . And it's round . industrial designer: That's uh {disfmarker} marketing: But then you are losing your fruity colours . industrial designer: Yeah . Well we have to make a {disfmarker} project manager: Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour . So uh those kind of things you can you can combine . marketing: That's true . industrial designer: Well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control . I don't think that's very practical , project manager: No , it isn't . industrial designer: but {disfmarker} But uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking , it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger . project manager: Yes . industrial designer: 'Cause if you look at this , it it doesn't look very very strong , marketing: Yeah but the {disfmarker} industrial designer: becau But this is plastic , and and this too , but {disfmarker} marketing: But it doesn't have to look strong . The the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy . industrial designer: The feel ? Uh alright . marketing: The feel . project manager: So , if you ti industrial designer: Well {disfmarker} user interface: And it it doesn't have to be strong , also . project manager: Well {disfmarker} marketing: Nah yeah the feel {disfmarker} project manager: You you {disfmarker} Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something . user interface: {vocalsound} Only the feel . {vocalsound} project manager: So it it looks pretty but it feels strong . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: Right . user interface: Oh . industrial designer: And I {disfmarker} Then I have some more findings . Um {vocalsound} uh about the energy energy source of the of the device , marketing: I agree . industrial designer: uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery . I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course . But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for uh for a simple remote , marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: that's a bit , oh , that's a bit uh {disfmarker} That's a bit uh much . project manager: {vocalsound} {gap} No titanium . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium . That that's the information I received . If you use the curved case , uh a curved case , double curved then you can't use titanium . project manager: What do you exactly mean with double curved ? industrial designer: Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look . user interface: {gap} industrial designer: And uh {vocalsound} now the the shape , yeah , {gap} a curved case . Um yeah I think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something . Uh {gap} a more modern look not plain , long box style , but {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} I dunno . project manager: Double curved ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} I'll draw it , project manager: It it mean {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , well okay . {vocalsound} industrial designer: but maybe later . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape , than if you have uh {gap} . Um anyway {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons . No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive . And , uh as we agreed , we don't use a speaker or a sensor or um {vocalsound} uh speak uh speech uh controlled {vocalsound} device . marketing: Yeah right . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Because it makes it also more complex and expensive . But we do use an L_C_D_ screen , so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive . But {disfmarker} It's worth the trouble I think , project manager: Well {disfmarker} user interface: The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material . industrial designer: because {disfmarker} user interface: Because people like that . project manager: This soft material thing from uh {disfmarker} Yeah . industrial designer: Uh rubber is a soft material , I guess . user interface: Yeah . Right . Yeah . industrial designer: Uh soft enough . marketing: Yeah . Right . industrial designer: So that's uh basically what I want to talk about . project manager: Alright . Okay . We will take that . And then uh Mike ? Okay . user interface: Yeah . Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier . Um an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented . Um we must decide where , this meeting . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems , {vocalsound} um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines . And um well they're cheap , so we could use them now . project manager: {vocalsound} Oh {disfmarker} That's interesting . user interface: Um it's not really speech recognition , it's more um like you can um talk to the chip , uh record the message and record an answer , and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left . So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded uh hi Mike back , then you will get that . industrial designer: Oh , yeah , I understand . Yeah . marketing: Oh okay . {gap} project manager: Okay . But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function . marketing: Right . user interface: No it doesn't does not do anything . marketing: No . project manager: Oh . That's a bit uh {disfmarker} user interface: But i it's just a {disfmarker} marketing: But that that makes it cheap . project manager: Yes . I understand . user interface: Yeah it's it's cheap . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: It's {vocalsound} it's just a an extra function , project manager: But {vocalsound} it has no functionality for our remote at all . marketing: and it's cheap . user interface: No marketing: No but {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: but that's the gadget they want , or the gimmicks . marketing: Yeah , right . {vocalsound} industrial designer: But it it's n nice for young people . marketing: Young people love them . user interface: Yes , we we should really uh include that one , I think . Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: They like gadgets . Yeah . marketing: Yeah , ple Right . project manager: Hmm . industrial designer: If it's cheap . Yeah . user interface: Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and {gap} uh and that kind of stuff {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons . project manager: So you put a menu in the L_C_D_ ? user interface: I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that . Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , I think . For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable . A voice recognition can be uh implemented . And uh I drew an example , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: but it did not work quite the well uh the way I wanted it to do . marketing: {vocalsound} Alright . industrial designer: Can you draw it now of uh {disfmarker} marketing: How {disfmarker} How {disfmarker} project manager: Ah . user interface: Hmm ? Well I have the {disfmarker} I can draw it again , industrial designer: Can you draw it now ? user interface: and I know what I did wrong . I didn't tick the note bo box in the {gap} . Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm . Alright . marketing: How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen ? user interface: {vocalsound} Um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the {disfmarker} marketing: Alright . So you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down . project manager: But then we should also have an uh an Okay button . user interface: Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen . Yes . marketing: Yeah right . user interface: {vocalsound} Um I shall draw this . If it uh works . industrial designer: {gap} button , yeah . project manager: Just uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} There is already a blank . Yes ? So {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Mm so have I . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Nah . marketing: {gap} . {gap} You have to push hard . project manager: {vocalsound} {gap} marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: I suggest a banana shape . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Because of the fruity uh fashion . marketing: Yeah . project manager: No m Next year that's out . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yellow and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah alright , yeah . Just a hunch . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh correct . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ? user interface: Yeah just uh the numbers . {vocalsound} industrial designer: And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ? user interface: These these will be bigger in the the real design . industrial designer: {gap} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Alright , yeah . user interface: This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the L_C_D_ screen . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: And with this you can uh , yes , go to through the menus project manager: Yeah . user interface: and that can Um the video button should be uh an apart button , marketing: You've {disfmarker} project manager: Yes . user interface: because you want it to uh t , yeah , to use it fast within one uh click . marketing: Right . project manager: And what's the menu button ? user interface: Um it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: And you you need a you need a speaker . user interface: Hmm ? marketing: For the {disfmarker} {gap} user interface: This button can also be the Menu button , we use in the menus {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: But how did {disfmarker} How do you get out of the menu then ? Yeah . user interface: Well we we can add another button here , but {disfmarker} project manager: Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay . Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh by pe pressing the menu button again . By pressing the menu button again , you go uh out . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: It's usual the the the d kind of the way it works . project manager: Yes , well but bec because when you {vocalsound} push Menu you get in , industrial designer: Yeah ? Yeah ? project manager: and then you have to push Okay when you get to a choice . user interface: Ah right . Well you you {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . But you can men you can press menu again to get out . project manager: Well that's also the Okay button . That's you you should have uh {disfmarker} user interface: No no , we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button industrial designer: No . project manager: Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out . user interface: and this the Okay button . marketing: Exit . project manager: Exit {gap} . user interface: Ah once you have an extra Menu button , you don't need that that extra option . project manager: Well , it's just a choice . user interface: You have uh redundancy . marketing: But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part . user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: {gap} marketing: Or don't {disfmarker} user interface: if we decide to uh to implement that , maybe we should . industrial designer: Why would you put it uh then , and where is the recording uh the microphone ? user interface: Well they that could be anywhere . industrial designer: Where would you put it ? user interface: That's very small . It could be uh down here . {vocalsound} Um . Well , not here . industrial designer: Uh-huh . user interface: I {vocalsound} yeah I suggest here . But that's just a little {vocalsound} gap . Yeah . industrial designer: Microphone , yeah . marketing: Right , and spea speaker at the back , or something . user interface: Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same uh little hole thingy . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah I understand . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Alright . industrial designer: Uh but uh we could uh d do , but it's perhaps more expensive , uh the speaker on the back or something . user interface: Well i Um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines , so they won't be uh very expensive . But {disfmarker} project manager: Huh ? industrial designer: Alright . marketing: Alright . project manager: Yeah ? Okay . user interface: This is my suggested design . project manager: Well , okay , alright . Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make . user interface: Um {disfmarker} Yes . And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom . project manager: I'd {disfmarker} I agree . user interface: {vocalsound} But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , fine . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Fine . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well yeah yeah yeah . marketing: Move on . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . user interface: Oh , um I had some uh examples . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I can live with it . project manager: Yes ? user interface: You can uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But {disfmarker} I did not like it very much , but {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Well these are quite obvious , very ugly remote . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} project manager: Too big . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: They do they don't look fruity enough . user interface: No , well th marketing: {vocalsound} Nei They're n they're not trendy . project manager: They're all black . user interface: Yeah . Well not all . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Hey , that one I like . {vocalsound} user interface: Uh this is for children but {vocalsound} th industrial designer: Tho Yeah those {disfmarker} marketing: It doesn't look strong . {vocalsound} project manager: No . user interface: {vocalsound} No . industrial designer: But it doesn't uh the {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} The remote . {vocalsound} user interface: W but with the colours i it's a bit the way we're going to . industrial designer: Yeah , ok Yeah . marketing: Yeah right . user interface: Well this is a terrible {disfmarker} project manager: Terrible . marketing: This is just crazy . industrial designer: {vocalsound} But it it must not look too childish of course huh ? project manager: It's it's all too much buttons . user interface: Um this looks {disfmarker} project manager: Too many buttons . That's {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . This uh these are the L_C_D_ screens . I think we should , if it's um possible , uh one with colours , but {disfmarker} marketing: Nah th It's too expensive . user interface: I don't know uh {disfmarker} project manager: Well , that's too expensive I think . user interface: Too expensive ? Alright . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Alright . Yeah . user interface: Well {disfmarker} Nah . industrial designer: But it {disfmarker} Yeah . {gap} project manager: Okay . Huh . user interface: Ha , even more . N project manager: Mm no . {vocalsound} 'Kay . marketing: But are we going for a strange uh form ? project manager: No , not very strange . marketing: 'Cause people like that . industrial designer: Not not too strange . No . marketing: Not too strange . project manager: It still has t marketing: You can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the L_C_D_ is . project manager: Yes . Th a a kind of bridge . So it f falls over the hand . user interface: Well {disfmarker} marketing: I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone , with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms , s something like that . project manager: Yeah ? Yeah ? Yeah . marketing: You know ? {gap} project manager: Well I have at home {vocalsound} a remote with a bridge . It's just a half round half half circle at {disfmarker} And then it falls exactly over the hand , and that's very nice . That's {disfmarker} It feels comfortable . marketing: Yeah , but people like something uh new you know . industrial designer: Exotic yeah . marketing: Yeah , different . industrial designer: We have t Yeah , yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: I will design it , we design it later . marketing: Y yis industrial designer: So we'll get to that later I guess . marketing: Alright . Great . project manager: Yeah , alright . Um where did I put it ? Um conceptual phase , I think this is it . industrial designer: The specific shape . The {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: I got this from our friends . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh yeah the conceptual design . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Our sources . project manager: These are a few examples which we have to decide about . All the the materials from the case , uh the electric cable that's all your uh your side of the story . Um {disfmarker} marketing: Your bag . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Um now from the user interface , your uh package ? {vocalsound} Um where {disfmarker} No well , that's more like the buttons where they have to come . And um {disfmarker} B a bit of , yeah well , a bit of uh design . user interface: Yeah , this is what we've just done . Right ? project manager: Yes , but we have to decide about these now . industrial designer: But uh we should decide now . user interface: Ah right . marketing: Yeah . project manager: And uh the trend-watching . marketing: Materials are the most , most impor project manager: So as you said , fruity is in , well {gap} sells good . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Wow . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Uh these things . industrial designer: So we have to uh put it in one uh document . {vocalsound} project manager: Uh yes . Um so if we uh go through them {disfmarker} industrial designer: Copy paste uh this story into a into a Word document , and then uh put the answers after the subjects . {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Not everything . industrial designer: Well we have to decide all these things ? user interface: Yeah but {vocalsound} all these examples are uh of a coffee machine . project manager: Yeah well uh {disfmarker} Why should I uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: W we can uh override them ? marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well a case ? Uh that's me . Uh I suggest {disfmarker} Well what do I suggest actually ? {vocalsound} project manager: What what kind of properties should it have ? Well we just listened . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Uh s solid , user interface: I think we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: yeah . Yeah . user interface: Why don't we um use uh titanium or or a hard , yeah , some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front . marketing: Do you know the new uh {disfmarker} user interface: That {disfmarker} Just like um most cell phones are . industrial designer: Yeah , I understand . marketing: No {vocalsound} no {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . So we have titanium . {vocalsound} marketing: The front is the most important . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: to give that uh strong look . project manager: You know what ? industrial designer: And then the front is made of plastic . And you can put that on and off , and switch it . user interface: Yeah . marketing: But the feel of plastic isn't strong . {vocalsound} industrial designer: No but you have titanium of course . user interface: No but you you have this {disfmarker} Yeah . industrial designer: Uh you have the best of both worlds . marketing: Yeah alright , alright . 'Kay . user interface: Yeah , you have the re remote in your hand like this . So you feel titanium . {gap} industrial designer: And of course , yeah , you have the the the plastic front end . But you also have the titanium . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} Fronts are are cheaper than when they're from plas user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah of course , but yeah {vocalsound} you have to make a decision . user interface: And I don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to . marketing: Yeah , but it it's expensive . industrial designer: I guess so . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Uh titanium I sh I think uh {disfmarker} marketing: Bendable . industrial designer: Huh ? Well , well the {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Bendable . user interface: Well any colour {gap} {disfmarker} industrial designer: According to my sources , uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh {disfmarker} Titanium is available , and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it , if we want . user interface: Yeah , then you you paint it in the colour you want it . The plastic is is the colour you want it . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Yeah . Paint spray . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Yeah alright . user interface: So {gap} {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: Alright . marketing: So , we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front ? project manager: I've uh {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Yeah , project manager: Titanium back , plastic front . industrial designer: I think that's a nice trade-off . project manager: Okay . Um well I am going to put it in here , uh because we can uh look . marketing: Yeah , great . project manager: I {disfmarker} Um solid feel and trendy look . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Alright . project manager: So material , um hard plastic for the front ? industrial designer: Yeah , for the front and then titanium for the back . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: For the non-removable uh part . marketing: But then you have the problem , when you have a titanium back , you can't switch it . When you want an other colour on the front , it doesn't match . user interface: Well titanium is neutral . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: You know ? industrial designer: The titan titanium isn't isn't v very {disfmarker} Yeah , i it doesn't uh {vocalsound} curves . marketing: {vocalsound} I understand . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} No uh I nei . {vocalsound} Titanium is very {disfmarker} No no no , but you know b Titanium is very basic colour , marketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . user interface: Hmm . industrial designer: and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: I dunno if if you disagree , marketing: Alright . user interface: Well {disfmarker} industrial designer: but I think it's doesn't matter very much . user interface: Our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours , marketing: Yeah . Alright . user interface: and they don't use uh wood . marketing: {vocalsound} Funky customers . industrial designer: And even if it does uh doesn't match , it will uh {disfmarker} People like mm colours that don't match . user interface: Mm . Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . And well marketing: Alright . {vocalsound} project manager: the the electrical cable is just normal uh {gap} . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Cop copper uh material . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Excuse me ? marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: The electrical cable uh does {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: It's uh from uh our coffee uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah copper i just a ba basic uh {disfmarker} user interface: No we don't use an electrical cable . project manager: {gap} {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah inside , but this is for the coffee uh machine . industrial designer: Yeah in {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of uh {disfmarker} project manager: Of course . user interface: Yeah , but that's not what's meant here , I think . {vocalsound} marketing: Nei . industrial designer: {gap} marketing: So external . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Oh external ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Well {gap} {vocalsound} A coffee grind doesn't have {disfmarker} Na ja . Never mind the coffee grind . project manager: Well uh marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard work . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Right ? marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: The chip is normal silicon . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh the buttons are normal , etcetera . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay ? So that's just easy . industrial designer: Alright . Mm-hmm . project manager: Uh we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our {vocalsound} earlier uh remotes . The conceptual specification of the user interface ? Um well we have our beautiful drawing . user interface: Well I got a better one here marketing: {vocalsound} Alright . user interface: and I will um {disfmarker} project manager: Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder , user interface: The shared folder . project manager: and then I'll put it in our end report . user interface: I will work this out uh for the uh next meeting . project manager: Yes , you can {disfmarker} Mm yeah . You can uh put some uh which button is what . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . Um user interface: Yeah yeah yeah . project manager: the trend-watching {disfmarker} {gap} included these days .

Uh this fruit and bright colours , yeah well I think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour , we'll have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want to launch , when we uh {vocalsound} well introduce our remote . industrial designer: Uh we still have to make {disfmarker} We have still have to make the es the the real basic design . {vocalsound} Because yeah we have the sketch but {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . But we we must remember that {vocalsound} fancy look-and-feel is the most important thing . project manager: Yes . marketing: Else it w won't sell . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: So {disfmarker} project manager: Yes . industrial designer: Alright , yeah . project manager: Well I'll have to , before I get another warning for five minutes , I'm going to get {disfmarker} Where is my mouse ?

So you'll get it on your em on your laptop . Um well you will go and do something else uh on the project {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Some {disfmarker} Some non functional tasks . marketing: {vocalsound} Have fun {vocalsound} . project manager: yeah project evaluation . So um {disfmarker} marketing: 'Kay . project manager: {gap} , what are you going to do ? Uh I don't know what product evaluation exactly means , but uh you'll get uh the specifications . marketing: We don't have produ product yet , project manager: Yeah . marketing: so kind of difficult . {vocalsound} project manager: That's why I uh {disfmarker} But uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} You're fired . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: No but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: How long do we still have ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well , can we talk about something else ?

Nah . user interface: Yeah . Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah ? user interface: Will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ? industrial designer: Round I think . marketing: Um round . user interface: Yeah I I I also uh thought {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: Yeah . Round . industrial designer: To make it as uh as round as possible . user interface: And these uh these s these buttons {vocalsound} uh are more uh triangle-ish shaped project manager: Why does {disfmarker} marketing: Curvy . Yeah . user interface: with a square one in the middle . marketing: So you can see you have to up or down . project manager: Ah f fuck you . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: But now I see the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: And this must be uh volume I think , project manager: Heh ? marketing: and this programme . user interface: Mm . project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} We can't get {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Well most of the time uh up and down is programme and left and right are volume , I think . industrial designer: Well th th th th th that depends uh . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , it depends , but {disfmarker} If you turn up the volume , you always see this thingy go up . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well we uh {disfmarker} We we j we'll just give them an uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , that's right . industrial designer: We'll design it , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and then they can give comments on it . project manager: Ts user interface: Yeah alright . marketing: Yeah . Okay . project manager: It doesn't work any more . We can't save them . So we'll just have them uh standing there . marketing: Yeah , I noticed . You can't uh click the corners . project manager: No . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: It's a bit uh bit a pity . marketing: It's a real real great thing . project manager: {vocalsound} Well we still have uh more than five minutes . Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: So {vocalsound} what are we going to do ? {vocalsound} I as Project Manager ha don't have a clue . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Let's start the design . project manager: Oh we can uh decide how we implement {vocalsound} the feeling from our company into the remote . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Well yeah . Um I think um {vocalsound} a logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be {disfmarker} project manager: Also the slogan ? On the {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , why not ? {vocalsound} If there's enough space , {vocalsound} you can put uh {disfmarker} user interface: Uh I I'd say only the logo . industrial designer: We'll we'll {disfmarker} marketing: O Yeah . Me too . user interface: Too much text and it gets too too busy . industrial designer: Well , our slogan is not very long . It's just a simple {disfmarker} project manager: We put the fashion in electronics . user interface: Well {vocalsound} it's quite a long phrase . industrial designer: What is it ? {vocalsound} project manager: We put the fashion in electronics . marketing: But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} You c {vocalsound} But you can put it on the back , on the titanium part . The logo and the and the {disfmarker} user interface: Ah the logo should be on the top I think . marketing: Yeah , right . The logo {disfmarker} project manager: On the top . Yeah . Well in in in the right top corner ? industrial designer: Yeah they do . Well yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Right corner , yes . project manager: And well you c On the back , you can put uh h {vocalsound} At the bottom , you can put the logo with the {disfmarker} industrial designer: Right corner , or maybe here in the middle ? user interface: {gap} uh the text ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Just just small . user interface: Uh yeah , at the back ? marketing: But the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable , when you get off the front . user interface: Well you c Well uh {disfmarker} Yes . industrial designer: Yeah it it should be hard on the on the on the board , project manager: Yeah well {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: You can {disfmarker} industrial designer: and you can remove the front . user interface: The logo can be on on every uh front . marketing: Yeah , user interface: Yeah , but then you must uh really uh yeah {vocalsound} push it in or something . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Carved into the material . {vocalsound} No , you you can carve it into the titanium at the back . industrial designer: I l I like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: But {vocalsound} am I the only one , or uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , on the backside . project manager: Well , management would like it . {vocalsound} user interface: Well n n not not on the front side , I think . project manager: The front side , no no l no slogan . industrial designer: No not on the front , user interface: {vocalsound} On the back {disfmarker} Yes , you you can , yeah , push that in , industrial designer: but on the backside . Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Sorry . user interface: {vocalsound} so that it is always be there . industrial designer: I think it's a nice idea , {vocalsound} to make it more recognisable , that the next to the logo you have the slogan . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: I agree . industrial designer: To make more uh of an impression . marketing: But not too big . industrial designer: Not too big . No , marketing: Just uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: very small . Not {vocalsound} on the entire back , but uh just very small . marketing: {vocalsound} You have to make this titanium too . industrial designer: {vocalsound} But readable enough of course . marketing: Okay . project manager: Yes , slogan from company on the back with logo industrial designer: But we'll uh we'll take that uh with us into the design . user interface: Yeah I think over here the logo . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Lo Uh yeah . Or maybe here in the middle , but we'll decide later . project manager: and logo also on the front but not exchange uh {disfmarker} Uh ? Hmm ? {vocalsound} {gap} Uh when changing fronts . marketing: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} project manager: Alright , that's decided . industrial designer: Do you do you see a bit of the of the um of the uh titanium ? O on the front ? project manager: Five minutes left . industrial designer: Uh maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium , user interface: Yes we could {disfmarker} industrial designer: {gap} the front is the the upper part , and the the bit with the with the L_C_D_ screen . So {disfmarker} project manager: So a bit of titanium between ? industrial designer: Yeah . No no betwe marketing: Yeah . project manager: That's a bit {disfmarker} Oh that that's that's pretty cool . industrial designer: of between we can do but {disfmarker} But then you have two parts of front , two fronts that {disfmarker} user interface: No , they have two fronts , marketing: No no no no . user interface: that . You you can {disfmarker} project manager: No ? user interface: Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: This enti entire bottom ? marketing: Else you you get problems with the L_C_D_ . Like dust in it and so things like that . project manager: Yes . user interface: Yeah . marketing: When you exchange all the fronts and it's open . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: I already have uh all kinds of uh filth between the mobile . user interface: No , you can you can just {disfmarker} And then not a straight line but uh some sort of wave or something . marketing: you can make it go round this corner too where the logo is . Because it has to be uh there all the time you know . industrial designer: And then the lower part is titanium ? user interface: This is titanium . And this is uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: I think that's nice , yeah . marketing: Yeah . Some some kind of wei weight in it . Yeah . project manager: Yeah . Round forms . user interface: F front . industrial designer: Yeah . I like that bit of uh titanium also on the uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . With the with the curved edge . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yep . industrial designer: A bit like uh a bit like your mobile phone . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Maybe you can show it . It also has the those {vocalsound} two distinct uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Tada . industrial designer: Mm bit like this . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Uh it's uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , project manager: What ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Ah . industrial designer: That uh {disfmarker} project manager: So round where ? industrial designer: Yeah . Maybe a nice touch , yeah . marketing: So uh a little corner of titanium . We can't uh take a blank one . user interface: Yeah , that's nice finishing touch you need . project manager: Oh , yeah . marketing: Or can we ? project manager: Yes , {gap} that also sounds uh pretty uh neat . industrial designer: {gap} marketing: So this this is the exchangeable part . industrial designer: I think I'm going to buy it . project manager: {vocalsound} We want it . user interface: Yeah , this is the front . project manager: And it's only f twenty five Euros . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Come on . industrial designer: That's a bit too much , but {disfmarker} project manager: No that's nothing . industrial designer: No , no no no , but {vocalsound} I think uh this looks uh pretty nice actually . project manager: The Phillips remote uh costs more . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Of course , because it's my design but {disfmarker} marketing: Right . user interface: My design . {vocalsound} industrial designer: No our d our design , alright . marketing: {vocalsound} Taking all the credit . {vocalsound} project manager: Well uh you two are going to work together . You'll get your uh specifications on your uh laptop , and then uh {vocalsound} you uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . We'll stay here I guess ? marketing: But there's a problem . project manager: Well I think we can , I just {gap} {disfmarker} It's {disfmarker} marketing: It's not relaxing . user interface: Well we can uh erase an animal I guess . Uh the fourth one . marketing: Yeah . Nah that's alright , that's alright . industrial designer: But don't erase my cat . project manager: Yeah , o user interface: Uh the fourth one is empty , isn't it ? marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: Oh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: I want to preserve it . project manager: {gap} {vocalsound} user interface: {gap} marketing: {gap} This one is empty . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: You have to empty one huh ? project manager: Oh , we have a {gap} one . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: What are you doing chief ? project manager: So , you can uh draw a {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: Alright . user interface: Yeah I think we have to wait ? industrial designer: Yeah project manager: Well I'll get a {disfmarker} I'll get the message . industrial designer: until the until the beep goes . marketing: No {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: But I don't uh {disfmarker} Do we have to stay here , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: No , I think uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: or I think we have to return first . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Well you'll {disfmarker} Maybe you can uh keep your uh laptop here . {gap} user interface: Maybe . project manager: Or get your mouse . Because it's little bit uh hard to work with these uh plates . industrial designer: The high powers from above {vocalsound} will have to tell us , yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: I always have a mouse next to my laptop . marketing: {vocalsound} Dream on . {vocalsound} project manager: I hate these {disfmarker} marketing: I I don't have a laptop . industrial designer: Yeah , touch-pads , yeah . project manager: Ugh . industrial designer: We can uh do a touch-pad on our remote . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah right . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} No just kidding . Well we have uh b you have to have a bit of humour in the in the discussions too , marketing: You just have to push harder . industrial designer: because it becomes too too too too stressy . project manager: And in your remote control . So we put a touch pad on it , and say ha ha . user interface: {vocalsound} Aha . This has no function . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Half project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: We know you'll you'll you'll hate it but {vocalsound} {disfmarker} industrial designer: But uh th youth doesn't care about functio functionality , so {disfmarker} marketing: No . project manager: But they do want some gadgets . So that's wha what we're doing . marketing: It's all about cool things . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: And it will sell . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: We will be rich . industrial designer: Bless you . {vocalsound} project manager: Well we won't . Our bosses will be rich . industrial designer: Mm . user interface: We've done too much in the previous meetings . industrial designer: Too much ? user interface: Yes , we've got nothing to do now . {vocalsound} project manager: Well , that's not bad , is it ? industrial designer: Well they uh {disfmarker} marketing: No . industrial designer: I think that's good . We all had uh our talk and we agree I guess on uh several thing , on most uh on things . project manager: Mm . user interface: Its the best remote ever . project manager: So {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Pinball . project manager: Oh {gap} . Oh he's totally off again . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Well {disfmarker} marketing: No man . industrial designer: Yeah you have to push harder . {vocalsound} project manager: But when I start here , it's here . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: So is it {disfmarker} user interface: Yes , but you you get really close to the screen with your hand , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: and I don't think that's {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Mm . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Hmm . project manager: Nope . marketing: Recalibrate it . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Where's the good old chalk board with the the green board with the , how do you call it , chalk , yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: We can better uh draw a design on this . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , maybe . user interface: Yeah , but we can't . industrial designer: Maybe if i if that thing is recalibrated , we can draw a thing quick , and then before it uh {vocalsound} goes off again . project manager: Yeah . Let's go . user interface: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Finish meeting now . project manager: Finish the meeting now . Alright now we know what to do , so user interface: We'll stay here ? project manager: Um {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah .
