project manager: G good morning . user interface: Good morning , Flores . Marketing Expert . project manager: Oh yeah . user interface: Right . project manager: Are you ready ? You should put the laptop uh right into the square . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: For i for the cameras , yes . user interface: For the cameras Alright . project manager: Good morning , Sebastian . industrial designer: Good morning , {vocalsound} Mister P_M_ . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} {disfmarker} I'm fine . industrial designer: {vocalsound} How are you today ? How was your business trip to Boston ? {vocalsound} project manager: Um well , actually I didn't go , didn't feel like it . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Geez . project manager: So {disfmarker} Do you want to open it as read-only . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Um I guess I should close it here . user interface: You have the same message of uh Windows cannot um marketing: {gap} user interface: sen oh stand-by . Close the the window . marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: Okay , the waiting is for our Marketing Expert , Ruud . user interface: So {disfmarker} That's right . Ruud . project manager: Um project kick-off . industrial designer: Is there a schedule for this meeting ? project manager: Yes , there is actually . Um I will li list the agenda for today . For this meeting . Good morning , Ruud . marketing: Good morning . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Uh it's important um {disfmarker} industrial designer: I shall close the door . project manager: yeah , great . It's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square , um for the cameras . Okay . Okay . Um we're here to develop uh a new product . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Um I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Um {vocalsound} and um this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it . Um you are here in a specific role . Uh Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here uh in the role of Industrial Designer . Is that correct ? industrial designer: That's correct . project manager: Okay . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Um {vocalsound} we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here . Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan , uh and we will have a discussion . Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , so we should keep that in mind . user interface: Alright . industrial designer: Okay . Um is there any room for a little presentation ? Uh maybe during the discussion uh section ? project manager: There is ? Yeah , there is . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} No problem . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Um okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop , um it's a remote control , a television remote control . Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly . Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals , um and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop . {vocalsound} Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things . user interface: Okay . project manager: The market , we should have a look at the market . Um {vocalsound} we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages . Uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the {gap} {disfmarker} the the progressions , yes . user interface: Progressions . {vocalsound} project manager: Um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will um make a specific {disfmarker} uh specification of that . Um {vocalsound} the second is the technical functional design , um what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think . user interface: It's for the vision . Yeah . project manager: Um and the last one is the working design . How exactly does it work in the technical sense . Um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later . So we'll kop it {disfmarker} keep it with the functional design . {vocalsound} Okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here . Um as you see now I can give a presentation . {vocalsound} Um it's also possible to use this one as well . You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to . Um {vocalsound} to um presentate , to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . Um then we have this electronic white-board system . {vocalsound} Um yeah , I will show that now . Um you can draw on the board using this pen . There are little um uh user interface: Sensors . project manager: sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the uh to the end . Um well , it {disfmarker} it's on the um eraser now , so we click the pen button . Okay , so not too fast writing . Um {vocalsound} you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . It's quite the same . Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file . So do not m make a new file . Just use this one uh during the day . {vocalsound} Um you can use the eraser to make something go away . user interface: But we all use the same white-board file project manager: Yes . user interface: So we can work together on it while we're {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . user interface: or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? project manager: Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings . user interface: Yeah , okay . project manager: It's really like like a regu regular whiteboard . user interface: Yeah , alright . Yep . project manager: Um you can choose the format , um {disfmarker} sorry . Uh {disfmarker} Let me see . Um {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I guess it's maybe because I'm not s uh pen selected . Yep . Current colour , you can choose another colour . And um for example black , and you c I can choose the line width . Um so now I d have a different line width and uh colour . Okay . Quite easy , if you uh do have any questions , just c ask me . Um {vocalsound} to um {disfmarker} oh well , I'm {disfmarker} I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder if you want to uh discuss it with us . Um as a little training {vocalsound} um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected . {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . Um green . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: An animal . Okay . Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh a wee rabbit . user interface: It's a bunny . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: A rabbit . Okay , well great . industrial designer: Alright . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Um Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . user interface: But of course , Flores . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Blank . project manager: Sebastian is thinking about the animal . industrial designer: I'm just uh guessing what should be my favourite animal . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah , I'm think about it too . {vocalsound} Format {gap} . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but {vocalsound} it works , industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well , I'll give it a try . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: It it should be a cat . user interface: right ? project manager: Okay ? user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Mm . project manager: {vocalsound} I'm guessing a horse . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Very good . {vocalsound} user interface: With a very small {vocalsound} legs . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} I was very good in drawing . {vocalsound} user interface: You should feed that uh that animal . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well , I guess you uh get the idea . {vocalsound} project manager: Yes , okay . {vocalsound} Beautiful . industrial designer: Beautiful . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to . Um any questions {disfmarker} well , just just let me know . Um okay , back to our project . Um {vocalsound} the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros . Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros , which is quite a number . {vocalsound} Um user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: we uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country . And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development , {vocalsound} um because uh , well , those are important numbers . Um then the discussion , maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation . industrial designer: Yes , um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion , because uh there might be some uh project manager: Limitations . industrial designer: influations influences . project manager: Okay . user interface: Okay . project manager: Okay , great . industrial designer: Okay ? {vocalsound} Okay . Um first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer . I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities . So that's one . {vocalsound} Uh I also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that , but {disfmarker} well , these are quite the same . Sorry about that . Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion . One thing about uh interopera operability . Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device {disfmarker} diverse subset of equipment . Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment . So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment . user interface: And for a cell phone ? industrial designer: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . user interface: Yeah , okay . Yeah . industrial designer: I think it could come in handy . We should discuss that . Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other . We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore . But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth . user interface: But {disfmarker} Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so industrial designer: But it's cost-effective . Yes . Mm-hmm . Well , not all , not all . user interface: y you you can {disfmarker} Most of them . industrial designer: So that's the point . user interface: Or you shou sh use a {disfmarker} industrial designer: So {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . industrial designer: Maybe , but that's uh something we should discuss user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and uh about every everybody should think about it . So that's just my role , I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: but take these things into account when you start the discussion . project manager: Okay , so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability , industrial designer: Yes , project manager: and {disfmarker} industrial designer: so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment , project manager: Okay , and and uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: and the way of communicating with these equipments . project manager: Okay . Okay , good . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Um {vocalsound} that was your presentation ? Okay , okay . industrial designer: That's it . project manager: Um {vocalsound} okay . Great . Um {vocalsound} I'll go back to my own presentation . Um {disfmarker} Mm . Okay . Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . Um there are other things like um {vocalsound} how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role . Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . Um so let's start with you . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ? user interface: Well , I had a few uh things in mind . Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um {disfmarker} Yeah uh , what is it , devices ? project manager: Yep . user interface: {vocalsound} Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store . industrial designer: Yes , I think it should be something like that . user interface: It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , project manager: Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , user interface: right ? project manager: not {disfmarker} we're we're {disfmarker} it's not a {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , I do I don't know that . It's no I have uh {disfmarker} don't have the information for it . industrial designer: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? project manager: No . No . industrial designer: No , user interface: No , okay . industrial designer: we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , so it should fit to every device . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Uh Ruud , y do you agree ? marketing: Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah . project manager: Okay . Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Well , the techni fu technical function uh {gap} {disfmarker} what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . That's just the basic f technical function . project manager: Yeah . user interface: So that was my {disfmarker} really my part for uh this session . Um {disfmarker} project manager: So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: Well , that's just the fu the technical function is {vocalsound} pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: It just should change the T_V_'s state . project manager: Okay . user interface: So that's it . Um but furthermore {disfmarker} industrial designer: And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? user interface: Yeah . Yeah , with buttons . industrial designer: Or are there any o other controls ? user interface: Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or {disfmarker} industrial designer: Are there only {disfmarker} any other cont Well , {vocalsound} user interface: But {disfmarker} industrial designer: I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Uh-huh . industrial designer: You know these things . And um it's very easy for a user to to switch {disfmarker} user interface: They're very vu vulnerable . industrial designer: w yes , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player . So maybe that's an idea , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: I don't know . user interface: And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing . Uh point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: so you must {vocalsound} point everywhere , so maybe infrared is {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Maybe not even pointed . Yeah . user interface: Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that . project manager: Okay industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh is that uh {disfmarker} are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited . user interface: Yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or {disfmarker} yeah . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that , industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: but if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in {disfmarker} outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . project manager: Okay , gentlemen , um uh just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting industrial designer: Okay . user interface: But {disfmarker} Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: um {disfmarker} user interface: Two more things . project manager: okay . user interface: Um You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand . project manager: Okay , s yeah . user interface: You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think . project manager: Yeah . user interface: And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al um {vocalsound} in dark too . project manager: Okay . user interface: So when it's dark {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Those are two really uh user interface {disfmarker} project manager: Uh I'll write down glow in the dark . Is tha {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . {gap} {disfmarker} That's perfect . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Okay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting . industrial designer: Do do you {disfmarker} project manager: Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the {disfmarker} such a product ? Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ? marketing: Uh I think most most things have already been said , like uh control multiple devices . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: And uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue . project manager: Because ? marketing: Uh well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: But uh lots of devices already use infrared . So {disfmarker} we'll probably have to implement that . project manager: Okay . Okay . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? industrial designer: Um well yes , I had , uh about three minutes ago , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: but I've seem to forget them {disfmarker} {vocalsound} forgot them . Um {disfmarker} oh yes , I remember . Um you said something about visibility in the dark . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Um uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it . user interface: Yeah . Well , maybe I um {disfmarker} but it it can be quite simple , industrial designer: I I don't know . user interface: you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . Okay . user interface: The uh the the digits in black . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: Uh then it's already visible in dark . So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy industrial designer: Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {disfmarker} well , it can be for design , of course . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes , but there's a cost limitation too . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Well , that's more {disfmarker} project manager: twelve Euro fifty , yeah . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: So that's a big problem , I think . I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: The cost price is very low . user interface: Just remind something . industrial designer: Um {disfmarker} user interface: The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade . project manager: Okay , okay . user interface: You have a m uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . Very good point . Yeah . user interface: Always have s the soft buttons , always uh clear the the the paint on it . The marks . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Okay , um I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now . Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily industrial designer: Mm-hmm . Okay . project manager: um or it should not consume too much um power . Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} So um maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or {disfmarker} user interface: But um {disfmarker} Necessary , yeah . project manager: yeah . I dunno , it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that's more Sebastian's uh um {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . But then Bluetooth uh might be problem . industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: 'Cause I think Bluetooth uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} It's use uh a lot of uh {disfmarker} project manager: Well does it ? user interface: Yeah , I know it from the cell phone . industrial designer: well {disfmarker} project manager: I'm not sure . Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's {disfmarker} it seems to work uh quite okay . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: So uh technically it will be possible . user interface: But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day . project manager: Okay . Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time . user interface: Does it {disfmarker} industrial designer: No , you cannot . user interface: {vocalsound} It's over ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Um industrial designer: Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} so we will go back to our own uh work . Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it . Um so this was it . user interface: Okay . project manager: See you in thirty minutes . user interface: Great .
