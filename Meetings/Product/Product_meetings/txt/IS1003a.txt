project manager: So we can start ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: Suppose I have to do my presentation . {vocalsound} Eh um {vocalsound} industrial designer: Ah okay . It's Ada Longmund ? project manager: {vocalsound} So , I'll present myself , I'm Ada Longmund , and as you may know it , I'm the pr project manager . So um we will have to um speak about m the project . Our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly . Record . So the project method is the following . So if we're um the functional design , you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other . Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design . Uh . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: The tool training is to try out the white board , so {disfmarker} industrial designer: Maybe someone ha we have to {gap} this whiteboard , marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: yeah ? marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Maybe you can draw your favourite animal industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: and make a list of its favourite characteristics . marketing: So right now ? project manager: I don't know if we have to do it now , maybe later later . user interface: So yeah I think you can do it . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , I don't know . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros . {vocalsound} user interface: Twenty five Euros ? project manager: Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Mm . project manager: I think it's quite good price , yeah . industrial designer: I it's it's reasonable , s quite {disfmarker} yeah . Twenty five . marketing: It's reasonable , I think , yeah . project manager: And uh user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: it will uh be a an international remote control , industrial designer: Is {disfmarker} project manager: as we want to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . So , as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um {disfmarker} with the remote control . Um just uh maybe be imaginative with {vocalsound} remote const con controls , industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: try to create something new and people would like to to buy . And {vocalsound} and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes , so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know {disfmarker} I suppose you know what you have to do . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . I I hope so {vocalsound} project manager: And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications . marketing: Those things just refer to each of each of us , I think . AMI project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yep . marketing: and {disfmarker} project manager: I_D_ , marketing: okay . project manager: yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: I_D_ is for the Industrial Design , yeah ? marketing: Okay . industrial designer: And U_I_D_ , it's for the User Interface Designer , user interface: That's me . marketing: Okay , industrial designer: yeah ? marketing: and Marketing Expert , it's me . industrial designer: AMI yeah project . project manager: So I will manage all all the group . industrial designer: {vocalsound} you will be the manager {vocalsound} yeah {vocalsound} marketing: You can manage all this , yeah . user interface: Okay . marketing: Good . project manager: So you have questions ? marketing: Um .

Make make {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: And the uh industrial design , it is how the object will look like . user interface: Maybe I think uh uh i industrial design's uh , it's the function design . industrial designer: Yeah . So the materi user interface: I design the user f user interface , you design the function . project manager: Maybe , it is the outside and the inside . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Okay right . But {disfmarker} I was thinking that he's a user {disfmarker} 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be , you know . user interface: Yeah yeah . industrial designer: But I don't know . {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: Well .

So you don't have to do something really specific , user interface: Okay . project manager: as everybody everybody will have to use it , user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Mm . project manager: it's sor the same as keyboards . You know , you have Qwerty , Azerty , French and U_K_ keyboard , user interface: Yeah . Mm . project manager: so really the remote control to be international . user interface: Yeah . Okay . project manager: And not too expensive . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . And uh simple . project manager: As we want to maximise the benefit . user interface: And easy to use . marketing: And you have to keep it under twelve Euros and f fifty , so . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty Euros . user interface: Ah , yeah . industrial designer: It should be {disfmarker} marketing: That's the problem . user interface: Okay . Okay . project manager: And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . {vocalsound} project manager: So , is it okay ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Mm . It's clear . industrial designer: {vocalsound} There was a step about drawing something in the in the board , I don't know . marketing: Yeah , maybe should go and draw an animal . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Is it ? {vocalsound} Are we supposed to do right now ? {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah yeah , you try .
