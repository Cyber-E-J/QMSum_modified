project manager: Oh . user interface: It's not saved yet . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: So {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . user interface: Our beautiful drawing . project manager: So just f um {disfmarker} So this is our agenda . You're {disfmarker} F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me . marketing: Oops . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Uh I didn't {disfmarker} Oh yeah . So these are the {disfmarker} industrial designer: Oh , okay . Yeah . project manager: So these are the um last notes we I made . If anything doesn't look right , just say it to me then . I don't have to put it in the report . user interface: Are we doing the the speech recognition ? Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well . project manager: Okay , but it's still possible uh uh financially . So if you want to , it's okay . user interface: Okay yeah . Well then then we're gonna put it in . project manager: Okay , just {vocalsound} {gap} {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , just uh we have to design the inside then , but it should be uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ? Or fold open ? I don't know . project manager: Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls . industrial designer: It's probably better . Yeah , s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you {gap} other functions . user interface: {vocalsound} It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well . project manager: Maybe that's better . Yeah , that's that's a very good point . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Okay , so when you have a lot of room inside . industrial designer: Think that's better . user interface: So you can make it very easy to use . 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it . project manager: Yeah . Okay . So this is okay ? {gap} user interface: {gap} No . Yeah , we're gonna use the advanced chip then . project manager: Okay , so that's {disfmarker} Uh I'll just have a look how much that is . industrial designer: {vocalsound} The {disfmarker} project manager: But um {disfmarker} Okay , for the {disfmarker} user interface: Advanced chip was for uh spee Yeah . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah , I I think so . I don't know . project manager: No , you have a different chip for speech recognition . So {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Ah okay . project manager: So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget . So it's okay . user interface: Good . project manager: So you can show your prototype if you want to . user interface: Together ? industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah , it's {disfmarker} Let's do it together . user interface: I'll give comments . industrial designer: Okay . Yeah , we just made a Word file with the basic elements . Uh the look-and-feel model . Uh well the form , the case um as drawn there . Simply a square with uh round corners . So that's basically it . {vocalsound} Uh the material should be hard plastic . Uh colour changeable , and also transparent . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: And colour and transparent , or just transparent , I don't know . Um then the elements . Uh we have {disfmarker} The functions are just basic . Like uh I've pointed them here . Mute function , on-off function , text functions . This uh switch channel . project manager: Okay , cool . {vocalsound} industrial designer: And this is the the num-pad . And the logo is over here , and the mic . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: And the scrollwheel , no ? You operate that with your pointing finger . marketing: Means {disfmarker} industrial designer: So you hold it like this in your right hand and {disfmarker} project manager: Mm . So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ? marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Speech recognition . project manager: Yeah , speech recognition . Just {disfmarker} Only one button to say it's on or off . user interface: Um I didn't have a specification of that . But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something . industrial designer: Uh I dunno . user interface: Um so I've {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , maybe maybe uh you have to configure it . user interface: Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore . project manager: So you can put it on the back as well if you want to . user interface: Yeah , you can {gap} put 'em all on the back . That's for sure . industrial designer: Yeah , or or on the slide function , I don't know . project manager: Okay . user interface: That's uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad . marketing: Okay . user interface: We also don't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons . But {disfmarker} You have a lot of room if you can slide it open . project manager: Yeah , you can put it separate . user interface: You {disfmarker} Yeah I know . I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So {disfmarker} But it's enough room . industrial designer: Yeah . Um the position ? Yeah , you write uh {disfmarker} user interface: Uh well {disfmarker} industrial designer: You wrote this , so . user interface: Well the main , the main zap buttons are most central . That was the the most important thing . marketing: {gap} user interface: So uh the best {gap} place , the best reach place {disfmarker} Um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find . Um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out . That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's will uh will show up . Uh scrollwheel is on the left side . It's {vocalsound} basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know . industrial designer: Yeah . But it's not uh impossible to use it , if you're left handed . So y Because you can use your thumb then . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Just just one thing now . Um y you need to have more uh one two th You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine . user interface: Okay yeah , they {gap} {disfmarker} marketing: But you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes . industrial designer: Mm yeah . user interface: Yeah okay . That's that's below that then . industrial designer: Yeah , okay . user interface: It's uh twelve buttons . industrial designer: {gap} just so you get that . marketing: Okay , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's rather important . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah okay , just we just missed that . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: But um I'll just uh {disfmarker} I'll get back to later . F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device . So um should be popular . Um {disfmarker} The f uh the buttons creating ? Uh if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That or all round shapes , not uh rounded corners . project manager: Okay . user interface: So that , you know , you get a bit round feeling . Um we'll use hard plastic . Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons . Colour changeable . Well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up . We have decided uh {vocalsound} in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it . marketing: Okay . user interface: And also in the num-pads , there's also colour {gap} light behind it . project manager: And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ? user interface: So when you pre Yeah . project manager: How do you want to implement that ? Just on the {disfmarker} Maybe on the second level as well ? user interface: We're going to implement . Yeah . Mm just a little {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , these are just basic functions , so {disfmarker} marketing: Ah . industrial designer: All the non-basic are in {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . Um {disfmarker} marketing: Okay , there is one uh function I use uh daily , and it's not on the basic functions . It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart . Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player . industrial designer: Okay , maybe we use this button for the {disfmarker} marketing: That function must be {disfmarker} Yeah , maybe {disfmarker} Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions . user interface: Yeah , project manager: Yeah , as well . user interface: I um {disfmarker} project manager: Just make make a {gap} {disfmarker} user interface: To your video device . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} A second level ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Like a a new blank one or {disfmarker} Or just here ? project manager: No no , just on {disfmarker} Down there . user interface: Is i Ah okay . project manager: So uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . Yeah . marketing: And h how does the second level come out ? project manager: Just uh if you s marketing: Uh it slides uh along ? user interface: Um slides I think . project manager: Yeah , y Maybe , yeah . user interface: It's marketing: From from the uh beneath ? project manager: For the bottom . user interface: You can do it that it claps open , but I think that's not solid enough . project manager: No , you gotta slide it . user interface: If that breaks then you're screwed . project manager: Yeah , it's right . user interface: So it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open . Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: So what do we need ? user interface: Uh i the the speech functions buttons . industrial designer: Yeah , just {disfmarker} marketing: Menu ? user interface: Menu button . With uh maybe uh arrows . So you can uh project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: scroll in the , navigate the menu . Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: God damn it . marketing: Scart ? user interface: {gap} I think we can even put a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels . marketing: Uh yeah . And so y you keep you keep one , you have one left . Yes . {vocalsound} user interface: So you have one left for the {disfmarker} Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera . That's used pretty often . industrial designer: So this is the {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: If you have a Play Station , mm you use it every day . industrial designer: {gap} marketing: {vocalsound} It's a f {vocalsound} basic uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Extern or something . user interface: {gap} project manager: You want to save that file as well ? The drawing ? user interface: That was it . industrial designer: So here are multiple speech buttons , I don't know how many . user interface: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Doesn't really matter . Just just uh {disfmarker} user interface: It doesn't really matter . industrial designer: I don't know the functions . user interface: That's {disfmarker} Yeah well we don't have any uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . What else ? user interface: Hmm ? industrial designer: What else ? user interface: What else ? Uh menu buttons with arrows . industrial designer: Uh menu . marketing: Yeah , to navigate . user interface: S Just uh like {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh {gap} With arrows . user interface: Um I think it's best if we do . Mm where do we have {disfmarker} Or there . industrial designer: Like a normal um {disfmarker} user interface: Like on the normal uh {disfmarker} Like this . industrial designer: Yeah , with in the middle um a menu button . user interface: The menu button , yes . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Well we don't have any , anything on how many buttons speech requires . So you can't redesign it . marketing: {vocalsound} Mm okay . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yep . marketing: Uh and and you can hold it , project manager: {gap} marketing: you can hold it , and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Just press it once , the colour should uh switch . Press again , the colour switch again maybe ? marketing: {gap} okay . project manager: Or we just make it three buttons , all the colours on it . Just red , yel uh red , green and {disfmarker} marketing: Okay , yeah . Th Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , okay . marketing: If we have enough place , uh then we can do that . project manager: That's that's very easy , yeah . industrial designer: We can put those here . marketing: Colour buttons . And then we choose green , uh blue and red or project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yep . marketing: {disfmarker} Okay . project manager: Okay . marketing: Okay . That's uh {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: So did we miss anything ? user interface: Yeah , maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel , that it is volume . marketing: It {disfmarker} Some text uh buttons . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Yeah , but project manager: No , ma on on o on the on the {disfmarker} user interface: I just uh {disfmarker} The volume logo . marketing: there's one there's one text button I {disfmarker} industrial designer: Oh wh Here ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . {gap} project manager: Just make it {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . Yeah , or th or the {disfmarker} marketing: There's one text button I prefer . That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page , uh like seven hundred , uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text . user interface: Yeah , we have that on the the text button . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Do you do you {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yep . marketing: Did you think of that ? industrial designer: Yeah , but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext . You just switch it off and then {disfmarker} user interface: Uh why not ? project manager: Yeah , just put it on those extra f extra function as well . marketing: Ex Yeah . Yeah . user interface: No {disfmarker} Whoa {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well w we thought of a text button . And if you press it again , you get the the the user interface: I think um {disfmarker} marketing: The sta the state you {disfmarker} project manager: Oh just three stages , you {disfmarker} industrial designer: through view . project manager: Yeah , that's okay . user interface: Yeah , the three stages . Yes . industrial designer: Yeah , b but but if you're in the second stage , the third stage is switch teletext off . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: So you can switch back from second to w first . user interface: No , it doesn't have to turn it off . Just don't {gap} {disfmarker} marketing: No . Just remember where it was . user interface: Yeah . marketing: It it doesn't uh uh clear the the page . If you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ? project manager: Yes , that's to remember . industrial designer: Okay , okay . project manager: Yeah , but that's that's uh {disfmarker} marketing: But maybe it's not the way {disfmarker} user interface: I dunno if {gap} {disfmarker} project manager: That's a functionality for the television . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , I think as well , but {disfmarker} Uh yeah . marketing: Mm . That's maybe one thing we can discuss about . industrial designer: Yeah mm nee uh {disfmarker} No , if i {vocalsound} uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . Th th th if you switch it on . user interface: Yeah , in thi the the remote control in the project manager: Okay . Yeah , but you have to search every time again . user interface: the chip . industrial designer: Th i project manager: That's what what happening if you do it like that . But it's still the television that has to do that . user interface: Yeah , that's true . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno . Okay . user interface: So yeah . Um do we need to fix that or {disfmarker} project manager: No , that's what the television does . marketing: Mm {vocalsound} most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages . industrial designer: Yeah , those memory functions . marketing: But uh not not every every television , so {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay , it's cool . industrial designer: Was uh this logo for uh volume ? project manager: Yeah , that's fine . industrial designer: Okay . So that's it ? project manager: Is this prich pretty much it , yeah ? marketing: Yeah , I I thought about one thing . Uh the buttons ? Uh from which material are they now ? industrial designer: Mm . No no user interface: Just like your telephone , hard plastic . industrial designer: Yeah . Just hard plastic . So {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . project manager: It's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway . marketing: Because um if you use it a couple of years , some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away , are uh {disfmarker} And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ? Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ? user interface: I think just on the buttons . industrial designer: Uh I think just um {disfmarker} user interface: If you do it abo above or below , it takes uh more space . marketing: Well yeah . That's too much place . user interface: I don't think the space is worth it . industrial designer: Yeah , but {disfmarker} marketing: Okay , just leave it . Just leave it . industrial designer: I think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons . marketing: Yeah , and i The most time {disfmarker} Yeah , with rubber buttons . Yeah , okay . {gap} Okay . Fine . project manager: Yeah ? Okay , cool . Mm mm mm mm mm . Yeah , I don't know what this means . But I think we just evela evaluated this one . marketing: Yeah , I made some criteria uh , so we can uh ev evaluate our model . project manager: Oh okay , you made some criteria . Okay , cool . Okay . marketing: I d d d I don't think if it's right . {vocalsound} That shall show it . project manager: You have some usability criteria or {disfmarker} marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Okay . marketing: Uh no , uh all criterias we just argue about . Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: In the bottom . marketing: Oh . project manager: Look-and-feel ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: No , evaluation is {disfmarker} marketing: Evaluation crit Yeah , evaluation presentation . It's not in . Uh d it doesn't matter um {disfmarker} It only had two pages or something . {vocalsound} Um well I looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy , or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market . The Italians uh , how they think about it . And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff . I made some criteria , and we have to test the criteria from one to zero . We sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our project manager: Okay . marketing: um {vocalsound} model . project manager: Okay . marketing: And this {disfmarker} These are all I I I found , or I wrote down . And um {vocalsound} we have to discuss about {vocalsound} , if we give it a one or a seven . project manager: Uh I think uh if you have a kind of iPod idea . It quite beautiful . marketing: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: It's {disfmarker} marketing: Yes . project manager: We are actu We are the {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . marketing: Yeah , the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the iPod or something . And fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and {vocalsound} and that kind of stuff . project manager: Flashy . user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . Well I think we do {disfmarker} marketing: The LEDs . user interface: If it's really uh , if you can if you can get the iPod look , then it's beautiful , I think . marketing: Yes . project manager: But uh {disfmarker} marketing: And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of ? industrial designer: Yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste . user interface: Hmm ? marketing: The basic colours are black or green or yellow ? user interface: Um basic colours , marketing: Or you haven't thought about {disfmarker} user interface: um yeah . Well you didn't say . marketing: Ho how do we make uh {disfmarker} user interface: Maybe um company colours ? project manager: It's black . user interface: Black . marketing: Black and yellow . project manager: Yeah , yellow light . user interface: A bit a bit of yellow . marketing: Can {disfmarker} project manager: Do we have yellow light ? No , not really , but it's possible . user interface: Not not not yellow {gap} , but just a bit of light yellow . project manager: It's {disfmarker} marketing: Black white , maybe ? user interface: Like white , also ni or uh always nice . industrial designer: And what colours should the buttons be ? marketing: Uh {disfmarker} Because um {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , different colours . This is {disfmarker} user interface: Just um {disfmarker} project manager: Oh , the same as th th the cover . But also th the light behind it . user interface: Yes . industrial designer: But can you change those too , with uh the switch ? project manager: No , no . Make them {disfmarker} No , just make them black or grey or something . user interface: Yeah , grey . Just dark grey I think . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Okay , so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful ? Beautiful is uh really subjective , uh because it has to do lots with the colours . user interface: Well we have changeable fronts , so {disfmarker} marketing: Changeable fronts , so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful . user interface: So {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , just give it a one . It's okay . user interface: Yeah . project manager: It's perfect . I think it's just what you want . Or not ? {vocalsound} user interface: It's hard to decide for us , but yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . It's ju so subjective . user interface: It it's {disfmarker} At least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls . project manager: Okay , just give it a two . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . A two . Okay . The fancy look-and-feel . That's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Okay . And we can change the colours , so that's uh really fancy I think . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: One more thing . marketing: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Are w are we changing uh {disfmarker} Or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too ? Or n no back light ? marketing: Slide panel ? industrial designer: Yeah ? project manager: No . No , it's only on the number , behind the numbers user interface: Mm . Not needed {gap} . project manager: and uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , not needed I think . industrial designer: And and the switch channel is uh {disfmarker} There is a back light too ? project manager: That as well , yeah . marketing: Oh , you mean th this here ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but that's unnecessary . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: What do I think is necessary necessary item ? marketing: It's pretty cool . If you slide it open , {vocalsound} it lights up . That's that's really fancy , but {vocalsound} I don't know if it's reachable . project manager: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} Of course it's reachable . project manager: It doesn't make {disfmarker} marketing: Then we do it . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Okay , maybe just some light uh to to light it all up . industrial designer: Hmm . {vocalsound} user interface: So you can see what's really there . Not just not re on the buttons or something . project manager: No . Yeah . user interface: Just a green light or some blue light . To light it all up . marketing: Yeah , project manager: But {disfmarker} Yeah . Mayb Okay . marketing: but {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , just backlight . Not not the buttons . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons . So the buttons are just grey . user interface: Well yeah . Uh semi-transparent . marketing: Okay . project manager: Yeah , just only {disfmarker} Yeah , that's right . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Okay , fine . So I I think it's very fancy . project manager: So {disfmarker} Yeah , that's how I think . user interface: Yeah , w we've done a a lot of detail in light , so {disfmarker} marketing: So I'll give it a {disfmarker} project manager: Ye marketing: Yeah , and you can uh also choose your light , so {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , this {disfmarker} It is a one . user interface: Yeah . project manager: It's okay . It's cool . marketing: I think it's one . Okay , next . project manager: This is a difficult one , because we we don't {disfmarker} Yeah , we don't know it about the {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Learnable ? Easy to use ? Yeah , we shall test it {vocalsound} But uh {disfmarker} project manager: Uh {vocalsound} it's it's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use . user interface: Yeah . project manager: It's {disfmarker} That's {disfmarker} industrial designer: No , but you don't have to use that . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer . project manager: No . industrial designer: That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it . user interface: So I think it's easy to use , but {disfmarker} And learnable is a bit {disfmarker} marketing: Learnable ? It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control . industrial designer: Well , I think it is . marketing: Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel . user interface: Well y just uh f marketing: I think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or project manager: But the rest of it is very easy , marketing: {disfmarker} Uh then the re project manager: because there are so so n user interface: Yeah , I think it's very clear what it all does . industrial designer: So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function . user interface: Yes . marketing: Yeah . user interface: But the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn . marketing: Okay . project manager: So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use . marketing: Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker} marketing: But {disfmarker} project manager: And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device . marketing: Yeah . But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ? user interface: Device . marketing: And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls . So we h we have speech , uh the scroll wheel , and um the the the slide . You must slide it . And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls . project manager: But {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: 'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um {vocalsound} easy to use . user interface: Okay . marketing: Because easy to use comes after learnable . project manager: Okay , just {disfmarker} Easy to use is very cool , marketing: I I think it a three or something . project manager: so just give it a two . user interface: Maybe three then . Learnable's {disfmarker} project manager: No , but definitely better , much better than uh than uh than avera average , yeah . industrial designer: Mm uh . The normal . user interface: Yeah okay . Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know {disfmarker} user interface: Yep , true . Then a two . marketing: Oh . Okay . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} marketing: New features . Techno technological innovative ? industrial designer: The speech function and the colour . Colour . marketing: {vocalsound} The speech function is new . user interface: And the scrollwheel , backlights , slide . marketing: The scrollwheel and the slide . Uh I think the slide is pretty new . project manager: Slide is not n is is not new . No . I already have a {disfmarker} marketing: Uh I only saw it in a telephone , not in an remote control . project manager: Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight . And they all have a slide in it . marketing: Okay . project manager: So that's not new . user interface: But also slide that buttons come out , as well ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . user interface: Okay . marketing: Okay , and the the the lightning ? project manager: That's cool . marketing: Is that new ? project manager: Yeah for a {disfmarker} Uh for a f marketing: The lighting's new . user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Mm it's pretty new , I think . marketing: Scrollwheel . Speech ? industrial designer: Speech is new . user interface: Different colours , so {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , different fronts for a remote control , I think that's new too . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So we have a pretty new uh {disfmarker} project manager: There are no games on it , that's that's {disfmarker} It's not a one , it's a two again . user interface: That would {disfmarker} And we didn't uh {disfmarker} marketing: It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something . user interface: But then we also have the the home station . project manager: If you have {disfmarker} user interface: We are forgetting about that now , but {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . Oh yeah , that's right . Rechargeable . marketing: Uh-oh . user interface: We don't marketing: Home-station . user interface: recharge . industrial designer: Yeah , we didn't draw that too , but {disfmarker} user interface: But that's more like uh now . project manager: Yeah , just draw it afterwards . {gap} industrial designer: Yeah , that's just a normal th s simple thing . user interface: I don't know . project manager: If you {disfmarker} Can you save it on the same , in the same map as the other ones ? In the the project uh map ? user interface: Uh {disfmarker} Just save , save as ? project manager: Yeah . Mm-hmm . Uh save as ? No , that's not in the project . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well it's a already in the folder . L like number seven . project manager: Oh yeah , okay . Smart board . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but this one . user interface: Okay . project manager: This one is not yet in the {disfmarker} Oh oh . industrial designer: I think it is . project manager: {gap} marketing: {gap} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , it is . industrial designer: No , I think it is . user interface: Uh untitled ? project manager: {gap} user interface: Yeah , it doesn't matter . Save . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: But you still have to draw the resi the recharger . marketing: Uh all {vocalsound} the the seven , uh all the seven . project manager: Okay . And new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ? No , I think i if you have games on it , then then you give you have a one . But not {disfmarker} marketing: No , we are not extraordinary new or something . project manager: No , just so it's still a two . user interface: N industrial designer: Mm two , I think . marketing: Tha tha that {disfmarker} project manager: Targeted audience . Uh we are the targeted audience ? Do we like it ? marketing: {vocalsound} No , we we we searched for uh um {vocalsound} a young group , audience , beneath f forty . project manager: Yeah , but l younger than forty . So we we are exactly the targeted group . marketing: Yes . Yeah , but did we reach , um {vocalsound} with our uh style , the targeted audience ? project manager: I think so , yeah . marketing: Th that's my question . project manager: You get the fancy things for younger people . And you get the the aesthetic things for older people . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So you want {disfmarker} industrial designer: We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel , and that's what attracts the young audience . So marketing: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: think that's a two or a one . marketing: Um the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh {disfmarker} {gap} That's {gap} that's {gap} {vocalsound} That's this question . industrial designer: Yeah , but s it {disfmarker} That's basically not not handy . And {vocalsound} I don't thi I don't see {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , this . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: So we targeted it ? But we didn't follow the latest trends . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} No . Yeah , you could make a a front user interface: Mm . I think we followed the latest trends . industrial designer: a front that's that's like uh like a banana , {vocalsound} or something . marketing: Tha these are the only latest uh trends I uh {vocalsound} get on my computer . user interface: Oh right . Well uh fruit and vegetables , yeah . project manager: Yeah , you get different colours . user interface: You can different front uh {disfmarker} marketing: Uh yeah , th So we had we uh have uh a fruit uh {disfmarker} project manager: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Like a a f banana kind of front . marketing: Oh yeah . But spongy will never be . {vocalsound} industrial designer: No . marketing: So we give ourself a three or something . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: {gap} project manager: Oh . marketing: Okay . project manager: So that's eleven . marketing: That's uh {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} marketing: What's the average ? industrial designer: Eleven divided by six . project manager: Yeah , it is one point eight three . marketing: A perfect score . {vocalsound} No , I don't know . industrial designer: We're not too hard on ourselves . {vocalsound} user interface: This is a a power indicator . So you can see how far it's charged up . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay . Okay . marketing: And and you need n uh a button to call it , to let it beep . user interface: To call . project manager: Oh yeah , that's still {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Um {disfmarker} marketing: Call {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , but uh we have to make a speaker then too . If you want to make it beep . project manager: Yeah , maybe we have to skip that one . user interface: Okay . No no , I want that in . marketing: That's {disfmarker} Yeah , but it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} But we can we can do it uh underneath the logo . marketing: {vocalsound} No , we need that . That's usable . That's really usable . industrial designer: If you do uh {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah , th the speaker is very small as well , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , okay . marketing: It's {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} project manager: So I just got a financial um {disfmarker} user interface: Yes uh . project manager: {gap} You s {vocalsound} saved it or {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . I did save it . project manager: No . Okay , let's have a look at this one here , the production cost of it . If I forgot anything , just say it to me . It just is a battery . Yeah , there are some that they didn't mention , because recharge is not on the list . But okay . So I think we are pretty much in the right direction , because it's twelve point three Euros . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm {vocalsound} okay . marketing: {vocalsound} That's fine . industrial designer: But uh is uh uh {disfmarker} project manager: So this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: So that's both . marketing: Come on , it's perfect . Uh twelve point three point three . project manager: Yeah , and single curved curved . industrial designer: But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or {disfmarker} project manager: No , that's not on the list . But that shouldn't be {gap} . industrial designer: Can we make that for uh h twenty cents ? {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , we can uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Probably . I just {disfmarker} The b the button supplements , I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was {disfmarker} I'm not sure . user interface: Um {vocalsound} different fronts , but standard front won't be , yeah . project manager: See it's {disfmarker} I think it's okay like this . marketing: Special form , yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: It's hard to say . But maybe we have to um {disfmarker} Yeah , {gap} okay . Special colour , you can skip this one , because it's all quite normal . user interface: Yeah . project manager: We get different ones , that's all . So you can put a recharger in it as well . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} But this is expensive , the sample speaker . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: This ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , it's four . marketing: Four . It's four Euros . user interface: Oh , them . Is that uh included ? In the twelve Euro or marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , that's included . marketing: {vocalsound} So we are {disfmarker} user interface: Okay , then we then we need to use it . industrial designer: It's kind of weird that we {vocalsound} we get this information now , afterwards . Because {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , no . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Okay , so this is uh pretty much it this {gap} . user interface: Damn , solar cells are uh expensive . project manager: So {gap} I just want you {disfmarker} Yeah , we just made it . So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together . marketing: Okay . project manager: Okay . We can do some discussion about this . Was there room for creativity ? industrial designer: Sure . marketing: Yes . user interface: Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} Paul , was there room for crea creativity ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Beautiful . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Mm uh i Yeah , I think so . I think uh everyone uh {gap} already . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah m If we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity project manager: Yeah . marketing: Or a different style . industrial designer: then there {vocalsound} we probably have been creative . user interface: I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . We could make a lot of different uh remote controls . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: So it's creativity . industrial designer: Huh . project manager: Okay , so the leadership {disfmarker} Was there a leadership and {disfmarker} user interface: Of course there was . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: What do you have to say about that ? industrial designer: No , I think {disfmarker} marketing: Who was the leader ? {vocalsound} project manager: I dunno . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} Just normal discussion , I think . Not user interface: Yeah . {gap} industrial designer: one leader or something . user interface: One leader to check the time , etcetera . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . And make notes . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , I know . user interface: So more like a secretary . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay , next one . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Uh team work um {disfmarker} The the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard . We were not all {disfmarker} We were not um agree with every not agree with {gap} . marketing: Yeah yeah . We were not finished . industrial designer: Yeah , w we had so much information , that we get through email and just {disfmarker} project manager: We're not finished . marketing: Uh . user interface: Uh I think we {vocalsound} we got wrong information at the wrong time . I think that was the m biggest problem . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Like uh the prices . If we knew that before , we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker . industrial designer: Yeah , th that's weird . marketing: Yeah , because the prices uh could be twenty Euros or something now . user interface: Yeah , and if you had uh fifteen Euros , then we would {gap} it . marketing: And then {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: We had to {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm hmm yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Yeah , finance . industrial designer: So we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right . user interface: Yeah . project manager: But the teamwork was okay . marketing: Yeah , uh everybody could speak their uh opinion . And uh {disfmarker} user interface: I think uh everyone listen to each other . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design . project manager: Yeah . 'Kay . Yeah , what I have to say about uh means . The smart board is okay . Digital pen is horrible . I dunno if you use it . But if you want to download it to your computer , it's doesn't work . user interface: It was {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: Just doesn't work . project manager: No . user interface: Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with , if it worked really well . marketing: Digital pen or {disfmarker} industrial designer: {gap} Yeah . user interface: Just not work too slow . industrial designer: Yeah , i if if it would be faster , it would be great . marketing: Yeah , the drawings are are hard to make , I think . user interface: Yeah , more accurate . Yeah , it's i It should be more accurate . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Precise . user interface: And uh I think it would be great if you could edit it from , just with a mouse , from where you're sitting . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Not just pointing out on it . project manager: It's the same for the presenta for the presentations . You can do it from here . That's much easier than standing there . user interface: Yeah . project manager: And so you've {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , and p just point with a mouse . user interface: No use to draw on the board itself . It's just slows down . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: {gap} industrial designer: Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: But you might as well do it in normal computer style . project manager: like {gap} . user interface: Yeah , even harder to draw like this than black board style . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . And it's far too slow this way . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay . user interface: You cou You could draw on it , but not as main function . industrial designer: No . project manager: {gap} I think {disfmarker} Yeah , okay . marketing: Digital pen . project manager: So we made it in time . {vocalsound} And we made a remote control . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} We did it . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: In the budget , yeah . user interface: New ideas found . marketing: New ideas . user interface: Oh {disfmarker} industrial designer: What's that ? marketing: For for for {disfmarker} project manager: I don't know what it mean . Just {disfmarker} user interface: I just think if we uh {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} To gather , or to uh work together , uh or new ideas for {disfmarker} project manager: For remote control probably . user interface: I dunno . project manager: No , for the project . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: For remote control , a favourite for your text . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: No , for the prototype . New ideas . industrial designer: Yeah , but still , you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this . Because we don't have any sizes and {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . But it's for the next team . We don't have to do that . industrial designer: Yeah , but it {disfmarker} You can't possibly do that in such a short time , I think . user interface: That's for {gap} . Yeah , this this is just the idea phase , the {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , just brainstorming basically . user interface: Yeah . Details uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So are we finished ? marketing: Hmm . project manager: Yes , I think just {disfmarker} I just write a final report . user interface: Quite early . industrial designer: Okay . Yeah . project manager: No , we have only four minutes left . Uh it's okay . industrial designer: Oh okay . user interface: Oh , what do we have to do now . Do we uh {disfmarker} I thought we were done at four o'clock ? industrial designer: It's now quarter past three . So {disfmarker} user interface: Yep . marketing: {gap} I should take some pictures uh . project manager: Okay . user interface: Mm we can do it afterwards , so {disfmarker} marketing: Yes . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Let's play minesweeper . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: I found it as well . marketing: {vocalsound} Ti-din ti-din . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} One two three four five six seven cameras . Mm not bad . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: So that was it . industrial designer: Yeah . Now we can look at this . user interface: This is {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} We're probably not supposed to look at this , but {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} The old versions . industrial designer: Yeah , from the previous group . {vocalsound} user interface: They went for uh for a universal device . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: The touchscreen , yeah . user interface: Yeah , but also a different device {gap} . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Then an L_C_D_ uh would be handy . industrial designer: Hmm . Here are the basic functions in here , the selecting dev devices . user interface: Yeah , and touch screens for all our stuff , yeah . industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: I do agree with that . Yeah , tu-dum . English is not so hard by the way . industrial designer: No . marketing: I'm breaking a world record here . user interface: Well , leader ? Project Manager ? marketing: Oh shit . {vocalsound} We've got a problem , Paul . user interface: You do ? Yeah , you have to make a choice . marketing: Yes . No it's your choice . user interface: Wow , that's pretty quick . marketing: Tu-dum . {vocalsound} user interface: Uh uh um {disfmarker} marketing: Just pick one . user interface: You have to decide .

No , that doesn't work . user interface: No , you gotta use the magic pen . Hmm . What if I put one there ? marketing: That's stupid . user interface: We'll see . marketing: Okay . user interface: I don't agree . marketing: Mm . {vocalsound} Sorry . user interface: Yeah , you had two choices . That's gonna be draw . Or not . industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: Too bad . user interface: I'll put it here . You are going to put it there . marketing: Yeah , then I put it there . {vocalsound} No one wins . user interface: It's a difficult choice , either here or there . industrial designer: This is a very interesting design . project manager: {gap} user interface: {vocalsound} Ugly . marketing: It's just the same as normal . user interface: Oh {gap} a pen . industrial designer: Well it has a L_C_D_ , I think . user interface: Yeah , but {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . user interface: Then do it correctly . marketing: {vocalsound} Stupid design . Stupid . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} And what else do we have ? user interface: Stupid , the L_C_D_ screen . marketing: 'Kay wait , I'm going to draw something and you must y {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: What ? Okay , I'm going to guess what you're drawing . marketing: Okay , blank . user interface: No no , the new one . marketing: Oh . {gap} user interface: Uh they just don't save it . marketing: Um {disfmarker} I know uh . user interface: A house ?

It's a house . A plant ? marketing: No , it's {vocalsound} Only you can know it . user interface: {vocalsound} Oh yeah , I can know it . It's a {disfmarker} marketing: It's uh very hard to draw . user interface: {vocalsound} Okay , that makes it easier . I think I know . No , wrong . marketing: Mm . user interface: I think I know what you're trying to draw , but it's wrong already . marketing: It's {vocalsound} very {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , you missed the right side . marketing: Fuck .
