Project plan , that falls under the same heading pretty much . Um , I don't think we have any great discussion at this point . marketing: No . project manager: Um . Here is what this thing should be . This thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control . Uh should be original {vocalsound} , trendy , and , of course , user friendly . marketing: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: So maybe you wanna make some notes of that . marketing: Okay . project manager: Okay ? marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: All right . {vocalsound} Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve . Um . That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with . The same goes for the conceptual design , there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards . Detailed design , same thing basically . marketing: Mm 'kay so {disfmarker} Three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay . project manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . marketing: Functional , conception and detailed . project manager: I can't write with this thing . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Maybe we should redesign it . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yes . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: After we've finished the remote control we'll get to that . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , okay . All right ? Then , tool training try out the white board , participant can draw their favourite animal . Does anybody want to go and see how the white board works ? So that in case we have to , in the next meeting , present something on the white board .

Would you like s like just to see um how it feels , so that you have a little idea ? user interface: Yes , I'm Francina . Yes , sure . {vocalsound} project manager: In {disfmarker} marketing: Am I supposed to wipe off that or {disfmarker} project manager: No , no . No , that's okay . user interface: No , Okay . marketing: okay . project manager: I don't know , we'll get to that later . marketing: Okay . user interface: What should I draw ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Snake . user interface: I'm going to draw a snake . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . user interface: How does it look like ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh , okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: I hope the kitty cat is hungry 'cause I don't like snakes . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: Here's the project finance uh which , of course , we all have to think about when we design this thing . Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro . Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro , marketing: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} project manager: the market range unlimited meaning international marketing: Okay . project manager: and the production cost should not exceed {disfmarker} hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro . marketing: Mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Profit . Um is fifty mm . project manager: So these are all things , of course , to remember with the budget and when you design {vocalsound} to materials , cost , etcetera . Now , uh the discussion I guess is um does anyone of you have experience with remote control ? marketing: Oops . project manager: I exp I s 'cause we we use 'em {disfmarker} we use 'em , right , everyday . industrial designer: Yeah , of course , using remote control . Yeah . user interface: Yes . project manager: And um now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas ? Would you like it to be smaller , bigger , industrial designer: Uh . project manager: have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly {disfmarker} better marked buttons , you know , things like that ? user interface: Yeah , I {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yes , I I feel that all the remote should be very compact . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Small , right . Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah , those which we get here nowadays it's very long . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: And um and it should have multi-purpose . Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_ , it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also , like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Audio player . Oh . Okay . project manager: So it should be a multi-functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically . user interface: Yes , exactly Yes . industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: Yes . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Divides us {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . Exactly . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} At um twelve fifty Euros per {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Well . marketing: Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} We certainly can try to {disfmarker} I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things . project manager: It should be something new {disfmarker} it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have . marketing: That's right . project manager: Now , of course , the other thing to think there is maybe the design . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , of course . user interface: Yeah , design should be , yeah {disfmarker} it should be different . All the {disfmarker} almost all the remotes {disfmarker} project manager: Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know . Maybe it should {disfmarker} different colours or materials or you know . user interface: Yes , exactly . industrial designer: Yeah , maybe ten {disfmarker} I do yeah , colours user interface: Are different shapes . industrial designer: and al shapes also . Yeah . user interface: Yes . project manager: Um so yeah shapes right , you know , like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something , you know . user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Yeah of course yeah . marketing: Yeah okay , friendly shape , that would help . project manager: Yeah . marketing: I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap , project manager: Yes . marketing: because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them . They can't find it . project manager: {vocalsound} That is true , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or , we you know , whatever . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: And and they {disfmarker} suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the T_V_ off and they say , where the hell is my {vocalsound} my remote control yeah ? marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Well or yeah or if it's really , if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal . marketing: So some {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , some beep or something like that , project manager: Yeah . Mm-hmm . user interface: Or a b marketing: Uh so , so it's really the beep or , or a light should blink . industrial designer: so that we can go {disfmarker} project manager: So if lost {disfmarker} If lost uh signal with b throw signal , you know . user interface: Should ha industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: A fluorescent signal , yeah . marketing: Mm 'kay . industrial designer: Yeah , maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is . project manager: Exactly , I mean just {vocalsound} that's what I'm saying . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . May not be beep . project manager: I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or {disfmarker} industrial designer: Beep or uh it's a light , maybe it's a light . marketing: And do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond {disfmarker} what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ? project manager: Okay , my {disfmarker} my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden , in in other words if it's like in a dark spot , uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant , at that moment it's it's like , it's like um , what you call it {disfmarker} a light s sensors , you know ? marketing: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . project manager: In in that moment it has a sensor , i it it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep , marketing: Okay so {disfmarker} user interface: Yes . marketing: Okay . project manager: I mean , that we can discuss that later , you know . industrial designer: Yeah , probably {disfmarker} yeah , probably it's a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah . user interface: Yeah . And uh {disfmarker} marketing: So the light sensor would activate the signal . project manager: That's right . You know there would be {vocalsound} {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: right you have to have some kind of sensor and I I think uh voice or clapping it's not specific enough . Uh I know there are the lamps and stuff , you know , you can clap on and off , marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yes . project manager: but I think they only work to certain degree and {disfmarker} marketing: But it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it . project manager: What with {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , of course , that didn't {disfmarker} user interface: Then , in that case {disfmarker} marketing: Well , because you're s because you're silly . Because people are silly . industrial designer: I i we can't do it . project manager: Oh yeah well , but then those people {disfmarker} we can't help everybody . {vocalsound} marketing: I mean it could be on {disfmarker} well , i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: um {vocalsound} , project manager: Okay we have uh {disfmarker} marketing: you know , well {disfmarker} maybe we have to move along , okay . project manager: yeah , we have to move along , but I think we have some good good points to start with here . industrial designer: Yeah , good point . project manager: Okay , the next meeting will be in thirty minutes . I think you all {disfmarker} did you get uh notices on your computer for this ? Okay so well , you got the notice um industrial designer: Me yeah . user interface: Yes . project manager: {disfmarker} uh . The working design , I guess that's the function I_D_ {disfmarker} uh who is this ? The industrial designer {disfmarker} That's you . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah , it's functional de yeah , exactly , technical . project manager: Okay . So , we looking for a working design when we come back . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh working design , yeah , it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design . project manager: Then {disfmarker} And then the technical funct you are the technical function , industrial designer: Yeah , functional design , project manager: so so you are the working design . industrial designer: and you {disfmarker} project manager: So you have a working design and then a functional design . user interface: Okay . project manager: And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general . That would be your idea . And , of course , price . That it , that it , that the price is a good price . I mean , the price is given , but , that was {disfmarker} marketing: Mm-hmm . We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price . project manager: That's right . That's right . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: And , you know , specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that . I think that's the end of the show . Yeah . So um {vocalsound} we have {disfmarker} well , we have a twen two two two three minutes . Um any questions at this point ? Or uh suggestions ? marketing: Mm . project manager: I think {disfmarker} basically basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions uh , uh I guess , you can uh {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Okay , I think I have enough to think about 'til our next meeting . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah , even I have . marketing: How about you people ? project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Yeah , even I have , I think , yeah . marketing: Really ? Okay . 'Kay . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah , so let's see . marketing: Alright , well uh {disfmarker} project manager: Then uh we see you in about thirty minutes . And see what we can come up with . user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: Okay . marketing: Okay , very good . project manager: Okay ? user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Yeah .
