project manager: So we come to the third meetings . I have {gap} good . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Um so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . So we will talk about some specific details . industrial designer: Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept so can you please uh open uh {disfmarker} I'm participant two . project manager: This {disfmarker} industrial designer: Components design . project manager: {gap} industrial designer: Okay so uh the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department and have which components was uh available to build a remote control . So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique {vocalsound} to to store the energy . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: We also um {vocalsound} we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control . Now {disfmarker} project manager: Uh this is what we have decided in the last meeting . But if we use battery {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah b uh f well uh I meant uh by by battery I meant uh I will not have a uh a wire between the remote control and the energy source but uh I didn't fou we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote . So uh it's a point to discuss . Then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices , like wood , rubber , titanium or latex . {vocalsound} But uh well it's not a a re uh well a real issue for the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} from the technical uh point of view . Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} And uh this is the last point , the choice of chips . So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi won't work {vocalsound} in a cluttered uh {vocalsound} uh environment . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: So um so I think we can start with these two main things . For the case uh well uh I think that uh titanium is um is a good choice because it's trendy and it's uh it's uh well it's modern and uh user are are are {disfmarker} mm will be uh very happy to have a {vocalsound} a a nice remote . For the interface uh I think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons , simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip {vocalsound} that are uh well cheaper . {vocalsound} user interface: Mm . industrial designer: And s so uh we can move to the next slide . user interface: Sorry . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: What is this single curved {disfmarker} what does it mean ? industrial designer: Well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote . user interface: So it's it's not {disfmarker} industrial designer: You you will have the {disfmarker} well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the {disfmarker} user interface: Yo l yeah . When you hold on it , it is comfortable to hold . industrial designer: Yeah . It's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it's completely flat . user interface: Okay . Yeah . And the battery , is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter ? industrial designer: Yeah the um that's the point . The kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um {disfmarker} user interface: That that's what it means by kinetic . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah and by {disfmarker} well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy . user interface: Okay . Mm-hmm . Okay . industrial designer: But I d I don't know it's {disfmarker} if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy . user interface: Mm . {vocalsound} Mm . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product {vocalsound} ready for market . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} And {disfmarker} yeah and so can you go to the next slide please . So and uh that's uh that summarize well what I have said . user interface: Mm mm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wha industrial designer: So uh you're right we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh {vocalsound} if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy . user interface: Ah the department . Mm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} That's it . user interface: Uh {disfmarker} So I um keep in touch with the R_ and D_ department . industrial designer: Oh yeah user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I take care , it's all right . user interface: {vocalsound} So the titanium case is the normal case that {disfmarker} I'll show you some pictures that I have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not . industrial designer: {vocalsound} All right . Yeah . user interface: 'Cause I am not very sure , plastic , titanium or whatever . There's another point I want to make , is that the uh {disfmarker} well you've seen them I le na my presentation that um I point out some {disfmarker} why buttons are not the mm not the only ways you can {vocalsound} use {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , maybe n industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: We will , okay . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Three . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} So the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system , a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user project manager: {gap} user interface: and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data . So you s this gives you the ways to input data and we have uh {disfmarker} we are more {disfmarker} we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here . The idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing . project manager: What's the function of this button . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . So . project manager: I think it makes the the interface really {disfmarker} user interface: Ea easy to use . So next one . project manager: Graphical user interface {gap} . user interface: {gap} function five . So I can use the button , the mouse maybe . project manager: A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures . user interface: Yeah . So next line . So the {disfmarker} here are some examples . So they cluster the buttons together . They group them into col they colour them and uh they have different forms as well . Mm but this interface are kind of confusing . Uh basically there are too many buttons . Right . Next one . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: So some people are propose voice recognition and so {disfmarker} ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine {vocalsound} for this by a company industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: when you tell the {disfmarker} you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you . So I just got an email saying that . industrial designer: Mm-hmm mm mm . user interface: And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that , supposedly . industrial designer: Yeah fine . user interface: {vocalsound} The next one . Mm so somebody {disfmarker} some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , you can use that as real {disfmarker} so so that could be an option as well . Touch screen , I mean . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Next one . And some people propose a scroll button . Integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button . Like the one we have here . Uh , next one . So mm project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: so there are a few aspects that I collected here . So s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , and uh mm and prog basically they are programmable , specially for children . And uh mm {disfmarker} yeah yeah . And then they also secure uh covers , to protect uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings . So {disfmarker} But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features . I'm just saying that the {disfmarker} currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f {gap} customisable for different people . Yeah , so that's the point . The next one . And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover . Mm maybe useful for children , they migh you you they only see the buttons outside . And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside . So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: S a good idea . user interface: The next one . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: So this guy {disfmarker} this is another company that provides big buttons . At {disfmarker} I see that that is useful for old people and then you don't get it lost . But for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: And you can call your remote controller if you don't know where it is . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} T_V_ remote controller where are you ? project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: And then , he will beeps and to say that I am here , {vocalsound} for example . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} We should include speech synthesis in this case , no ? user interface: Is it possible ? industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Uh ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah but uh as Norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . And uh , this is another one where you can uh {disfmarker} the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume . So there's a up arrow and a down arrow . But you the see that in the V_ , the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top {disfmarker} on the top up arrow {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you {disfmarker} project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: up arrow there's a V_ like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface , so I wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design . industrial designer: Yeah yeah . user interface: And here are {disfmarker} is uh here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found . Big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . And uh user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key . Yeah . So {vocalsound} we have many concepts there industrial designer: Hmm . {vocalsound} user interface: but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: And basically uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well I {vocalsound} I think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote project manager: {gap} user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that , user interface: Yeah . Mm . industrial designer: because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so . user interface: Mm . Okay . project manager: Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control {gap} and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the T_V_ . industrial designer: Yeah . That's a good idea . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: To have a help button . user interface: A help button . project manager: Yeah . user interface: So you are display on the screen . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: On T_V_ T_V_ screen . user interface: So {disfmarker} on the T_V_ screen . industrial designer: On the T_V_ screen . On the T_V_ screen the uh how to use your remote . project manager: So just you push the button user interface: Okay . Okay . Okay . project manager: and we will {disfmarker} marketing: Oh . user interface: So that eliminates all the complicated documentation {gap} , project manager: Yeah . user interface: okay . So wi marketing: But people are often enough looking at the help , project manager: If the if {disfmarker} marketing: once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff . project manager: {vocalsound} No {vocalsound} In the case where they need help , in the case where they need help . industrial designer: Uh yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} It's a psychology . industrial designer: {vocalsound} In a marketing point of view . marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . user interface: Yeah . marketing: And let us see what the market demands . project manager: Yeah . marketing: We could just go to my presentation . industrial designer: But {disfmarker} uh wel well I think {disfmarker} project manager: It's just for user customizable , for kids or old people . marketing: Yeah that's right . user interface: Mm . project manager: So {disfmarker} marketing: I mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids and if you remove the {disfmarker} project manager: So it's the same {disfmarker} marketing: Same remote with some {disfmarker} project manager: Can be used by both kids and old people . marketing: Both yeah . user interface: Mm . {vocalsound} Well uh what I s propose is that uh you know a remote controller , i {vocalsound} it could be a cube , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the {vocalsound} um the buttons , if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons , you turn the other side you get the other buttons , so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls . {vocalsound} project manager: Maybe for kids , kids they like uh t no l they like to {disfmarker} user interface: Small {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh well . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So le le let's see what uh what {vocalsound} people want . user interface: Let's see the market demand . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: And then we can decide what what we can {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: What what {gap} market {disfmarker} yes yes . project manager: {gap} marketing: So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes . And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires . Uh we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions . And we found the following solutions which we could {disfmarker} which would be helpful for our design . So seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything . And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy . And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons , project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times . user interface: Yeah . Yes . marketing: So this were the findings which we found . And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls . Most of {disfmarker} fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them {vocalsound} rather than watching the T_V_ . user interface: Yeah . marketing: And by the time they found the remote control the program is finished . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So {vocalsound} they're frustrated a lot {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: And um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Mm , the functionalities yeah . marketing: So you can just see the percentage , fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them . We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control . user interface: Oh . industrial designer: Well mm w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having uh L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen . user interface: Big screen . industrial designer: It's {disfmarker} marketing: Mm-hmm ? industrial designer: yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on but it's it's expensive to produce {vocalsound} and it's not really {disfmarker} marketing: I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote , rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it . It's the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control . user interface: Mm yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah . user interface: Mm . The thing {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: We just {vocalsound} play around industrial designer: Yeah but when you play with the iPod you don't have {vocalsound} a big screen in front of you , s project manager: You can use this screen instead of the big se screen , user interface: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: instead of use the {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: If you re-use the existing screen , we element {disfmarker} eliminate the L_C_D_ , after all the L_C_D_ just to display project manager: Hmm . user interface: and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , as fancy as the one on the L_C_D_ , marketing: Yeah . user interface: maybe even better . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: So {disfmarker} marketing: I mean this were the points which we got from the market demands . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: So industrial designer: So I th I I {vocalsound} well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the uh user interface: Yeah . More on a fancy design . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah that's fine . industrial designer: on the speech recognition if the technology is available marketing: Yeah . I mean that's {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: but well I think L_C_D_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results . user interface: Mm . Remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: But {disfmarker} Yeah . user interface: Yeah . So i is {disfmarker} marketing: Uh yeah we have uh {disfmarker} project manager: {gap} user interface: so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost and then we'll decide again . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Uh maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time {gap} . Is i if i industrial designer: So price of uh L_C_D_ display . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: And {disfmarker} marketing: And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls . user interface: Yeah . And also the cost for the speech recognition . project manager: Mm . It's for {disfmarker} user interface: Ask our R_ and D_ department . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: it's just for small vocabulary . We {disfmarker} it's not {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary , project manager: yeah . user interface: Yeah . And ho marketing: say eighty commands or so . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah okay . user interface: And also the scroller button , how much will it cost . {vocalsound} industrial designer: And {disfmarker} Well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Push push {gap} . marketing: Mm , the scroll button , {gap} from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah I think that {disfmarker} marketing: Because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or {vocalsound} help button . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah I I I think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button user interface: Don't use the buttons . industrial designer: so uh I think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . project manager: It doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Important . industrial designer: Yeah . But {disfmarker} project manager: But they are just less used compar marketing: They're not used much . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: But the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the T_V_ screen user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: like uh a a list of function user interface: Yeah . Mm . industrial designer: and then you choose with the with the button to {disfmarker} well you navigate user interface: Yeah , yeah . So so the at most {disfmarker} more power uh . industrial designer: and you {disfmarker} project manager: Or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: But if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the T_V_ screen {vocalsound} I think that just five buttons are sufficient , user interface: Yep . industrial designer: one to go up left right down and uh enter user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that . user interface: Mm . Mm . Yeah . industrial designer: You don't have to to switch to a channel to another uh {disfmarker} project manager: Mm . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a L_C_D_ on the remote not on the television . Because when you have the L_C_D_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , we are most focused on the commands . industrial designer: Yeah but {disfmarker} marketing: So if you have then L_C_D_ in the remote , you just have a menu , and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu , in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} Yeah but if you look at the L_C_D_ you you don't look at the T_V_ screen marketing: And accordingly you can just increase or decrease . project manager: It's {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . Mm . industrial designer: so {vocalsound} i i it's not really worth to get {disfmarker} to have the image if you don't look at , so . user interface: I if {disfmarker} Mm . Mm . project manager: And I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_ . I {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah that has to be checked out . user interface: I think that there's no contradiction here , because if there are few buttons , you don't have to look at your your controller any more because you know where the buttons are , so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: and then you t turn {disfmarker} you just press lef increase or decrease button industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: and the same for the volume and the channel , {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . user interface: if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , just tell your channel and then you don't even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the the need for L_C_D_ , marketing: Okay . user interface: with the help of speech recogniser you can {disfmarker} marketing: I mean , {gap} better if we could just check all the cost with L_C_D_ user interface: Yeah . marketing: and also with the speech recognition . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: And then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case . user interface: Mm . Mm . {vocalsound} Yeah . A and {disfmarker} marketing: And the third problem was to find the remote control . Always , so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes . industrial designer: Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find user interface: Mm . industrial designer: and {vocalsound} when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh to make him beep or t project manager: You will listen to a peep , {vocalsound} special peep . user interface: Where {gap} , yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah that's right , that's exactly what I mean by voice commander . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Or it could be also something like this , user interface: Yeah . marketing: uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control , user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: so we have some one charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger . user interface: Put it back at the charge . industrial designer: Put {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps , wherever it is . project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . And that's a good idea , that's simple , like in phones . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Mm . marketing: I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command , project manager: But you don't you don't have to move the the charger . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: because there are problems with a voice command . user interface: Hmm . Mm . {vocalsound} Th yeah . Mm yeah . Yeah . Mm . marketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager: You have to keep it {gap} . marketing: I mean charger would be fixed industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: because it's always with electricity plugged . industrial designer: Yeah if there if there uh there is nuff not enough battery . Also and uh uh the remote is lost . project manager: Okay . user interface: Mm . There's {disfmarker} mm . Mm . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah that's right . user interface: That {disfmarker} we can {disfmarker} what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button , the off button , the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen , please charge charge me . You never get it lost industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: because uh every time you're off the computer {vocalsound} {disfmarker} the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where {disfmarker} to the charger . marketing: It's an good reminder , user interface: Yeah . So you will never get lost {gap} {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: yeah that's right . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Maybe for some people {gap} {vocalsound} lazy people . user interface: Yeah . Yeah because everything is programmed inside . project manager: Yeah yeah . user interface: So it's it's uh it's all about strategy , y marketing: And of course the final point is a fancy look . user interface: Mm . marketing: As we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they weren't fancy , user interface: Mm . industrial designer: They were ugly . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah . marketing: I mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons . industrial designer: {vocalsound} They {disfmarker} project manager: Mm . marketing: I think we should have something {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well the last one with the um {vocalsound} yeah with the two parts was uh {gap} original , so {disfmarker} user interface: With uh two two two parts controller . marketing: I mean {gap} uh I mean uh I mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and {vocalsound} use it , you can't avoid him . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: But you can have an button for child lock . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Mm . marketing: So just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he can't use even {gap} {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm . industrial designer: Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , uh things like that . marketing: Mm uh {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . project manager: Or {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . Yeah . Mm . marketing: That's right . project manager: Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and then just just {disfmarker} yeah just push uh kids button so it's automatically user interface: Mm . {gap} these are probl yeah . Mm . Mm . Mm . project manager: {gap} . So if he {gap} . marketing: I think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think {disfmarker} industrial designer: So for mm {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: yeah . So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on . marketing: Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these {gap} could be included . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Mm . {vocalsound} I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: because uh if you want {gap} uh say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . If numbers , they're easy , project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: but if {gap} name the channel by by name {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well I think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now user interface: Mm . industrial designer: and and uh {disfmarker} marketing: No , we have a problem there . You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh {disfmarker} basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five project manager: Yeah it's {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: and suddenly {vocalsound} the screen the channel goes to twenty five . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: That's right , yeah , yeah . marketing: So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . marketing: I mean the the {disfmarker} you just check all the probability that saying T_V_ twenty five and just ordinary twenty five . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Yeah yeah . marketing: Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Yeah but well {disfmarker} okay . marketing: and T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent . user interface: Mm . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Mm . marketing: So it's better to have some prefix {gap} before the number . user interface: But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers . marketing: Yeah something , some code . user interface: You say numbe channel number five of the T_V_ correspond to something else in the channel . industrial designer: Yeah yeah . user interface: So some people may want to say , I want to see this channel . industrial designer: Mm mm . Well I {disfmarker} marketing: That will be too big . project manager: Or just {disfmarker} marketing: And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also . user interface: Yeah . Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser . project manager: It's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel . It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel . user interface: {vocalsound} Uh ? project manager: Because you have to s t uh a ch user interface: Well , it's convenient for the user . project manager: yeah but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary . marketing: Als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number . project manager: Or maybe {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Then {disfmarker} project manager: Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary , user interface: The {disfmarker} uh uh mm . {vocalsound} Mm . project manager: just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary . user interface: I I think that I have {disfmarker} mm mm {vocalsound} I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh {vocalsound} if {disfmarker} when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the {disfmarker} you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button uh , you just you you just choose the the option you want marketing: Yeah , the {gap} . user interface: and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel . So {disfmarker} project manager: Or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel . user interface: Mm . So you you don't use the speech recogniser in that way . project manager: No . Just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train {disfmarker} you have to create the vocabulary by yourself . user interface: Oh , okay . Yeah . industrial designer: Well I uh I also {disfmarker} project manager: By associating each channel with the name or {disfmarker} industrial designer: I I also think about uh another problem , if if there is uh more than one person who is watching T_V_ {vocalsound} project manager: And for each one has his own . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two . marketing: Yeah yeah , {gap} . industrial designer: Because uh I remember when I was a {vocalsound} young child with my sister we {disfmarker} yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time user interface: Mm . project manager: Or you have to s {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , I wanna watch this , I wanna watch that . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: so it's a pr it could be a problem if uh if well if someone passes by when you are watching T_V_ and say oh T_V_ thirty {vocalsound} and just run , s user interface: Mm . marketing: A and in the same lines we would have a {disfmarker} one more problem . If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name {disfmarker} bad uh reputation for our company . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Mm . project manager: Mm . marketing: So I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands , say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Or we can switch on or switch off the the special {gap} , yeah . marketing: Yeah that's right that should be an option . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Yeah that's {disfmarker} well I think that's a good uh a good option because it's simple and uh simple to implement also , so . user interface: Hmm . marketing: I think these are the practical problems . So we need to take care of them in the design . project manager: Maybe we'll discuss them in next meeting . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: It's time to close this meeting . user interface: Well , you you stay a five minutes . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah {gap} . {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Oh it came there on three minutes back so we are {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I think we can just press the okay . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Thanks for your collaborations . industrial designer: So I see ya . marketing: Okay . See you another thirty minutes .
