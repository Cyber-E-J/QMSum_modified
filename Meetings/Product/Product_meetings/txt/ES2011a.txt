project manager: Here we go . Welcome everybody . Um , I'm Abigail Claflin . You can call me Abbie . 'S see . PowerPoint , that's not it . There we go . So this is our kick off meeting . Um and I guess we should all get acquainted {vocalsound} . {vocalsound} Let's {disfmarker} shall we all introduce ourselves ? marketing: Hi I'm Chiara , I'm the um Marketing Expert . Um , would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? project manager: I think we'll get around to that , yeah . So this is just introductions yeah . marketing: We'll get round to that later . My name is Chiara and I'm the Marketing Expert . project manager: Okay . I forgot to s say I'm the Project Manager but I figured you all knew that already , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} um so . user interface: {vocalsound} I'm Stephanie and I am the User Interface Designer . industrial designer: I'm Krista and I'm the Industrial Designer . project manager: Okay . Um so f here's our agenda for today . Um we're gonna do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close . {vocalsound} Um so . So our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . And to do this , we have to {disfmarker} um there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . So . We'll get to that . Oh there it is . Right . Functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . So throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things . Um {vocalsound} so we're gonna try out our white board . If we'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal . Okay . user interface: So you want us to draw it and then talk about it ? Or just draw it ? project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: I think both . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . Both . Yeah {vocalsound} . user interface: Okay . Why don't we do both . Right . marketing: Who starts ? We ought to decide who starts and {vocalsound} all that . No ? project manager: Any volunteers ? marketing: Uh-huh . project manager: Does anyone know what they wanna draw ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Mm , I gotta think about it for a second like . Uh {disfmarker} Does it have to be {vocalsound} functional , trendy and user friendly ? {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} I don't think so . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Um . Okay , I'll draw . I'll draw one . project manager: {gap} user interface: Make sure {gap} my things here . Uh-oh . Right . Okay , my favourite animal is {disfmarker} see . {vocalsound} Oops . project manager: A dolphin . user interface: Yeah , it's {vocalsound} {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} 'S like playing Pictionary . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , I guess it has a fin on top too , yeah . {vocalsound} It's my dolphin . project manager: {vocalsound} So what characteristics do you like about your animal ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: I like its tail . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Um , no , I think dolphins are really uh {disfmarker} I dunno , they're smart and they they're cute and they like swimming and that's cool , like {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} They're graceful . user interface: they're graceful yeah , and they're so {disfmarker} project manager: Sleek {vocalsound} . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah they're sleek industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: and they look intelligent and I don't know , they're {disfmarker} I guess it's the whole like binocular vision thing . project manager: I don't know how intelligent that one looks {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah he he doesn't look that smart {vocalsound} . He's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I dunno um they're {disfmarker} I think it's cool the the um {vocalsound} the interaction that or the th things that {disfmarker} the reasons people seem to like you know {disfmarker} you get ex you know people are sitting on the beach and p they're like oh look there's dolphins and it's kinda like {vocalsound} {disfmarker} but they're you know they jump around in the water and they're happy and they're mammals , but they swim . {gap} {vocalsound} project manager: Yes . {vocalsound} Does anybody else wanna draw their animal ? industrial designer: Suppose I can draw an animal , yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh-oh there goes the ten . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} It's a cat . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I don't know . They sleep all day , {vocalsound} they're easy to draw {vocalsound} . project manager: {vocalsound} Do you wanna {gap} anything ? marketing: Uh yeah . project manager: I dunno if the the {disfmarker} industrial designer: I think the pen is running out of {disfmarker} marketing: Well I had the cat as well , but uh I've got a spare one . project manager: ah . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: So I'll use the spare one . Um but it's harder to draw {gap} um . user interface: And the pen's dying {vocalsound} . marketing: Um . project manager: A horse . user interface: Horse . marketing: Uh . Um I don't {vocalsound} really know how the legs go , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: That's very good . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: but anyway I will do that . Um , and the main reason is they're pretty . I think they're very pretty and they go well with the environment , and I like the way they run and I used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of sturdy and nice animals . And I like the way um they feel , sort of under under the hand , I think that's pretty much it . Um {disfmarker} project manager: {gap} Yeah . This cord's {disfmarker} {gap} Uh . Right . Actually I haven't thought of anything yet {vocalsound} . Uh {disfmarker} It's a pig . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} So I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's water resistant , strong and furry . What do you think , yeah ? This is {disfmarker} user interface: And furry . project manager: yeah , well like a cat , you know , soft yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Textile {disfmarker} tactile , {vocalsound} tactile remote control . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Although {disfmarker} uh I'll just put there . Right . user interface: You're dragging a {disfmarker} you have a tail {vocalsound} . project manager: {gap} Oh my gosh , this is disastrous . Sorry about that . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} So moving on . Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro and profit aim is fifty million Euro . So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland , we're in some European country {vocalsound} . Um , and we will hope to sell this internationally . user interface: Sorry can you just say that {disfmarker} what's the {disfmarker} what are our price goals again ? project manager: Um selling price is twenty five Euro . Profit aim fifty million Euro . user interface: Okay . marketing: How many should we sell then ? {vocalsound} Um , a lot , project manager: Anyone a mathematician ? {vocalsound} marketing: two two two million , {gap} two mi no , more f four million . industrial designer: Two million . marketing: Four million . And it {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million . industrial designer: Oh , yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} It is a lot . Uh . project manager: So f that's a fifty percent um uh . Um , I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show . Experience with remote control . So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control . Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have . marketing: Um , I think one thing is that it should be easy to find industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: I was thinking that too . marketing: bec yeah {vocalsound} bec project manager: Yeah . user interface: I think we should design something that has like a {disfmarker} so you can {disfmarker} like somehow like you {disfmarker} I mean you always know where your T_V_ is , so just have a call button , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: I've always wanted that , project manager: Yeah . user interface: so like {vocalsound} you can push a button on your T_V_ {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah . project manager: I mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: Yeah , yeah yeah yeah , so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control . marketing: Yeah . And even I think a little light . Um or even a {disfmarker} maybe a vib a vibrating thing . I dunno but someth because it's usually under the sofa . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: In which case you're going to be l but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: I don't know if it's expensive maybe to {disfmarker} user interface: I don't {disfmarker} yeah I mean it {disfmarker} but like I mean {disfmarker} marketing: Maybe call is enough . But yeah . user interface: just I mean like your phone even just has so {disfmarker} like it can vibrate , it can light up and make noise and I dunno {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah . project manager: What if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it and you could {disfmarker} I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base . You know like a portable phone has a base , user interface: Yeah . Yeah , or if it had a {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: like just to have a home for it . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah yeah yeah yeah . user interface: Yeah , project manager: {vocalsound} 'Cause people just stick it on top of their T_V_ , but the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the T_V_ , so {disfmarker} user interface: I mean {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well that's why it's always in the couch . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah {vocalsound} . user interface: Yeah , in in the couch {vocalsound} . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} user interface: I dunno , it seems like though that that would be hard , 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . Maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah so we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the project is now couches and remote controls . marketing: {vocalsound} But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing , a pretty object attached to the wall . But that would really make it more expensive . user interface: Yeah . marketing: But it's only a plastic thing , r really , the thing on the wall . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Something like that . project manager: Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ? marketing: And the other thing is {disfmarker} user interface: Bigger . marketing: Not {disfmarker} well it needs to be sort of {disfmarker} project manager: Like Hand hand held size , yeah . user interface: Hand-sized . marketing: Yeah . I don't think you need a {disfmarker} project manager: Not not huge , but {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: But definitely not {disfmarker} well I don't know . user interface: It can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it . marketing: No , it can't be , uh-uh . industrial designer: No it really wouldn't be . project manager: Huh . user interface: Or like or like a light thing . You know . I dunno {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Like spaceship . user interface: . Yeah {vocalsound} . Or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you yeah {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: That would be really {disfmarker} I'm sure we could do that for twenty five Euros a pop . project manager: Little homing device . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} . Uh . project manager: Okay . So what do we think this remote control should {disfmarker} Five minutes . marketing: Oh dear . project manager: Till the meeting {disfmarker} oh right . This is what we have left . Um , oh we just {gap} user interface: I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons , industrial designer: Yeah , I agree . user interface: 'cause I hate that when they have too many buttons and {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} B_ button and the F_ button , they don't do anything . marketing: Yeah , yeah yeah . user interface: I mean I know it has to have enough functions but like , I don't know you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them . So . project manager: You {disfmarker} what if um may be a little fancy but what if it had like a little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions . Like the way a mobile phone does . user interface: That would be cool . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . I mean it just seems like {disfmarker} project manager: So you could like um {disfmarker} like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels , you can {disfmarker} the way you do it on your radio is that you uh {disfmarker} user interface: yeah . project manager: what do you call it {disfmarker} marketing: Select . Uh . project manager: s y yeah but you can programme , so you can programme like your favourite channels , so like if you had a s marketing: But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen . project manager: That's something we could decide . Mm . marketing: Because {disfmarker} user interface: I guess they would go together somehow ? I dunno . marketing: Because , I don't know if it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think it's e expensive , if you have {disfmarker} if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly's already a screen , then you can pro sort of have a programming function , really easy sort of arrow up and down , on the remote , project manager: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: and then use the telly as a screen . project manager: Right . marketing: But um {disfmarker} user interface: I'm thinking kind of {disfmarker} marketing: But yeah for sure . Something like not {disfmarker} it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do , project manager: Yeah . marketing: is that what you mean ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: Right . Mm . user interface: Or like you h you see those you know people {disfmarker} I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those {disfmarker} these things that at their house you know {disfmarker} their their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that {disfmarker} and it's like a hand held like {disfmarker} turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like {disfmarker} so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , I don't know if {disfmarker} it must be {disfmarker} it would probably {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: must be ex too expensive though t like I dunno . project manager: Mm . marketing: But like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap . user interface: Yeah , yeah . Yeah that's true . project manager: Yeah . I mean , we have to remember our budget is twelve point {disfmarker} twelve fifty for {disfmarker} to actually make the device . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Mm . project manager: Um but it's something to think about , yeah . user interface: Well , I guess we have to get to that later , yeah . project manager: I mean we'll have to see how much that would be . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Or some {disfmarker} it i we can find out probably on the internet {vocalsound} how much it's {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . marketing: Um . Yeah , and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: What was the word ? user interface: Furry . marketing: Water resistant . project manager: Oh I was just {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: No but it's {disfmarker} I thought , ah , spot on . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Good feel , tact tactile , good tactile feel , project manager: Yeah . marketing: maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot . user interface: Yeah . Mm , mm . marketing: That's quite annoying . project manager: Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: like that's another {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , clip . Ooh {vocalsound} . Um . project manager: Um . We should probably start wrapping up , um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into . Um , and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , which will be in another thirty minutes . Um . So . Yeah . The Industrial Designer , what does that stand for , I_D_ , industrial designer: Yeah I think so . project manager: yeah {vocalsound} um is going to be looking more into the working design . So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing . The something , what is the U_I_ ? industrial designer: User . project manager: Yeah , what does it stand for again ? user interface: That's me . Uh , User Interface design . project manager: User Interface Designer . So that's gonna be more technical . I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w user interface: So technical function . industrial designer: The working design is the structure . project manager: Yeah , yeah . user interface: What is technical functions exactl I I don't really know what {disfmarker} project manager: Um , I guess you'd have to find out {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {gap} industrial designer: Um . marketing: It says on that email but it {disfmarker} industrial designer: It was in the email . user interface: It does but it {disfmarker} I just don't really {disfmarker} industrial designer: I wrote down what mine were . marketing: It said um {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: It said {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} What effect should the thing ha should it have , okay . Alright . marketing: Yeah user interface: And working design . marketing: like {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . marketing: Be a medium between you and the telly I think , user interface: Yeah , yeah . Alright . project manager: Mm . marketing: that's uh {disfmarker} user interface: And how it works , okay . Right . I'm I'm on task . project manager: And the M_E_ , what does that stand for {vocalsound} ? M industrial designer: Marketing . project manager: Marketing , right . Um {vocalsound} . marketing: Marketing . Oh it's written here , but um . project manager: So we'll be working on the user requirements , um {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: Okay . project manager: So I guess that wraps it up . I'll see you all in thirty minutes . I just did .
