project manager: Okay . Uh first of all I'll start with the costs , marketing: {gap} . project manager: because that's going to influence our design . user interface: {vocalsound} Oh no . marketing: Oh , {gap} . {vocalsound} project manager: If you {disfmarker} Don't know if you al already had a look or not ? user interface: No n I I already did it . industrial designer: Did you do your questionnaire already ? marketing: No . user interface: It's not much . It's just one question . project manager: Because we have a problem . industrial designer: Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Oh . {vocalsound} project manager: If you look closely , you can see . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: It wants {disfmarker} project manager: Um I already took the liberty to make some suggestions . {gap} . {gap} . {vocalsound} At the moment we have fifteen buttons , one L_C_D_ screen , one advanced chip-on-print . We use a uh sensor , that's for the speech . Uh we use kinetic energy . And we wanted uh the buttons in a special colour . Okay . What's the first thing we should drop ? The special colour of the buttons ? user interface: No that's that's for the trendy uh feel and look . So {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah but everything is . project manager: Should we switch to a hand dynamo ? user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh that's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things . marketing: No . user interface: Yeah , b but {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah but young people like that . project manager: Batteries ? marketing: So just do normal battery . project manager: Batteries . user interface: I think the battery option . industrial designer: Just a normal battery then , yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: {gap} . marketing: It has to be twelve and a half . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Or not ? {vocalsound} user interface: Oh . {vocalsound} project manager: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Oh my goodness . project manager: You're going to redesign something . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Oh no . project manager: Okay , so we're at twenty five . marketing: Uh , yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ? industrial designer: Well I guess i we'll have to go for single curve then . I mean we have to drop on everything . project manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} marketing: But we can keep it single curved with uh top view still curved , but from the side it's it's flat , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and the screen screen is just {disfmarker} Well you just have to hold it like this then . So {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: How about {disfmarker} Sorry . project manager: Uh another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine , so you can't directly access a channel , but instead use only the up and down arrows . That would skip nine buttons and four and a half Euros . industrial designer: That's what I was thinking . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Alright . project manager: Yeah ? industrial designer: A a marketing: Let's do it then . Yeah . project manager: Uh then we have left {disfmarker} user interface: But we don't have any basic options any more . marketing: {gap} we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Uh yeah . We do . industrial designer: And uh 'cause then they don't have to n They don't need special colour as well . marketing: F_ eight . project manager: They don't need special colours . Fine . That's more like it . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} You were saying something . industrial designer: That was exactly my point . Like let's drop all the buttons , and just make one project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {disfmarker} I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway . So we'll just have to use it for everything . project manager: Mm-hmm . Yeah . industrial designer: And then you can make an overview of channels in the screen , and select a channel , click {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , some more menu options . Yeah . Okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: But um {disfmarker} Now let's look . user interface: Yeah we c could {disfmarker} We only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing . Everything you can do with with the menu . So {disfmarker} With the display . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah we need one integrated button for everything then . user interface: Yeah . marketing: The joystick . project manager: {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . Kind of . I was {disfmarker} Because {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , scroll-wheel , push-button uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . If you if you go to {disfmarker} marketing: Integrated scroll-wheel push-button , yeah . industrial designer: If you go to our uh view , like you {disfmarker} if you are in the sound system there , uh and you wanna adjust the treble for instance , project manager: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: this is just uh an example , project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: y y you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example . project manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . industrial designer: But you want a sound preview of how it's gonna sound , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: right ? So you wanna click on it , activate it , whe and when you move it , hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: So you'll you'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button . marketing: Yeah or or the integrated scroll-wheel push-button . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it , adjust it , click again and then you're out of it . industrial designer: Exactly . marketing: But you still {disfmarker} But you then still need to have {disfmarker} Well you can use the scroll-wheel as well for um maybe for the channels . But you still um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah it's r Yeah . marketing: You still have to have some some button in the menu to go back . user interface: So you do one inte You can do one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . marketing: Yeah . user interface: And then just drop all the other buttons . project manager: Uh yeah . marketing: Well not all . user interface: But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons . marketing: Not s not sound I guess . industrial designer: {vocalsound} No . project manager: Yeah . It's uh {disfmarker} One integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Mm . project manager: So {disfmarker} user interface: So we have to to make it s uh more uh {disfmarker} It has to be {disfmarker} project manager: You could also drop j three more of these , without losing much functionality . You just drop the Okay and the Back . marketing: Yeah . Wh wh what what what is the what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker ? project manager: Oh , that's for the speech . marketing: Speech recognition . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Could drop the speech recognition . {vocalsound} marketing: Right . project manager: S s Drop speech recognition ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} No but {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah that's possible . {vocalsound} user interface: We we d industrial designer: Yeah it's it's expensive , but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition . 'Cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons . project manager: Buttons . marketing: Buttons . project manager: That's not very easy to use . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: I marketing: No , it can be disturbed by by noise and industrial designer: No . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works . marketing: stuff like that . Let let let me see what's more what's more popular . I guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition . user interface: Yeah . marketing: I have to look on that . Let me see . {vocalsound} Uh well no I was wrong . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen . project manager: Yep . Okay . Because if you d lose the L_C_D_ screen , we {vocalsound} need a lot of {disfmarker} marketing: But if it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But it it {disfmarker} it's a it's a both a hypers user interface: We lose our whole concept . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Uh so {disfmarker} No we just {disfmarker} project manager: We need a lot of extra buttons . marketing: No , but {disfmarker} user interface: We keep the L_C_D_ . marketing: Well we Yeah we keep the screen . I mean it's it's about the same . Eight one to ninety one percent , uh sixty six to seventy six . project manager: Okay industrial designer: We uh we we haven't really integrated this {disfmarker} the speech into the system , project manager: so we drop the speech . industrial designer: so we can might as well s drop that . {gap} project manager: And drop it yeah ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . Let's drop the speech . project manager: Okay . S Fo Four less Euros . So we still have three and a half Euro to lose . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Sixteen Euros . industrial designer: {vocalsound} We need to lose some buttons . marketing: But y y project manager: Yeah if you lose the the Back , the Okay button {disfmarker} Uh v let's say we only have the four arrows , and the Menu button . marketing: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: Then you're {disfmarker} marketing: And then and then use um {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Oh and the power button we have also . marketing: The the {disfmarker} Okay . And the menu button does also does the okay function then . project manager: Yeah . marketing: And then when you in the menu {disfmarker} project manager: So that's one Euro . marketing: S so so you activate the menu . user interface: If we do uh two integrated scroll-wheel push-buttons , we can drop all the the push-buttons . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah ? And {gap} {disfmarker} user interface: With with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing . With the other , we can do the the channel , the volume , et cetera . marketing: Yeah yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . {gap} . project manager: That would save zero point two Euros compared to {disfmarker} No . user interface: No it's three Euros . No ? Um {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . To This together is more expensive than {disfmarker} Oof , it's almost the same as t keeping this . user interface: No it's it's n Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: And we can drop these two . marketing: Well okay . user interface: It's the {disfmarker} marketing: For example if you have f f four buttons , {vocalsound} channel up and down , uh volume left right {disfmarker} project manager: Volume . marketing: Okay , I've {disfmarker} I think we have to keep that . project manager: And the power button . marketing: And then {disfmarker} and the power button . So that's five . project manager: That's the basic . marketing: That's basic . That that's what you need anyway . And then for the menu , um you can have a button that activates menu . Or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll-wheel with a push-button . And then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel , the the the menu gets activated , and then you can scroll , choose an option , click on it , it goes into an feature . Click on it again , selects features , scroll , adjust it . Click again , it's okay . Then you only need one button to move back . Or or under each option , you set a {disfmarker} you set an a screen thing what says back , and you select that one , click again , and you go one step back . And in that menu , scroll , click , one step back . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: So that then you need five buttons , and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . project manager: Yep . Okay th that's {disfmarker} marketing: But we can't drop three buttons . industrial designer: Which {gap} {disfmarker} That's even {disfmarker} marketing: But I see that's {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah that's one Euro more expensive . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: So {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that's not a good idea . project manager: That's not an option . marketing: Because which buttons do we have now ? Those five which I mentioned , and then menu , and then {disfmarker} project manager: Menu , power . marketing: Yeah . F of the four things ? project manager: Four arrows ? marketing: Yeah , th power . project manager: Power . Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , if you if you go to eight {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Which more ? industrial designer: I don't know how to {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . Okay . So four arrows ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: Uh power I believe ? marketing: Power . Th Yeah that's five . project manager: {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} We have a Back and a Okay button . marketing: Yeah , okay that's seven , project manager: And the Menu . marketing: and one to activate the menu , yeah . So okay that's eight . Well we can't reduce that . We we keep the display . project manager: Yeah , and even if we drop three buttons from here , we still have to make some adjustments around here . So {disfmarker} marketing: Oh , well okay . Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , we need the chip for the for the L_C_ display . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: The L_C_D_ ? Yeah . user interface: Let's make the {disfmarker} Let's make the case plastic . marketing: Yeah well we need the advanced {disfmarker} project manager: Then I rather make it wood . marketing: Instead of r project manager: Because then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus uh people . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . True . marketing: Yeah but but that's not our market . user interface: But {disfmarker} project manager: No that {disfmarker} maybe not . But maybe it's better than plastic anyway . marketing: Ah no , hard plastic . {vocalsound} user interface: Plastic with a with a special colour . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Oh . user interface: A woo wood uh wood uh wood colour . marketing: Yeah , plastic with special colour . project manager: Yeah ? {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} No but I I {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah okay uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} That's an option . {vocalsound} marketing: Because we have to use the special colour anyway . You forgot that . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yep . Yeah , yeah . user interface: So we do one one s marketing: {vocalsound} So let's go for the plastic . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , okay . Plastic . marketing: And since it's not kinetic , it doesn't have to flip around that much ? project manager: Uh that's easy because plastic is free . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Hmm . marketing: We still have problem of two Euros . project manager: Yeah , okay . Uh if we dropped uh {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: No the buttons , those are really needed . project manager: Yeah ? user interface: Yeah th th it's it's uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah we can't drop them . user interface: An advanced chip-on-print . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} You still need that . industrial designer: Yeah uh {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Do we really need that advanced chip for an L_C_D_ display ? industrial designer: You {disfmarker} uh uh {disfmarker} Yeah . So the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker , and {disfmarker} Which can use a regular chip , wh which is six Euros in total . project manager: {vocalsound} S industrial designer: That doesn't matter . marketing: Oh . I rather keep I rather keep the display . project manager: No , I keep the re Yeah . Yeah . Because we already designed for it . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well yeah . marketing: So the only option is an hand dynamo . industrial designer: Exactly . user interface: {vocalsound} Oh that {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah and something else . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah but the {disfmarker} marketing: Oh no tha Oh that's one Euro , right . industrial designer: uh can't we f uh fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push-button ? 'Cause that will save us one and a half Euro already . And then if w marketing: And then integrated s Yeah but that would make it not so easy to use . project manager: No y you would rec marketing: I mean it's not that important , easy to use , but {disfmarker} project manager: Then you have {disfmarker} industrial designer: Th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want , huh ? project manager: Then you still need two additional buttons I believe . industrial designer: And uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: For the volume . industrial designer: Yeah d at l Yeah . At least one for power . project manager: You can use those {disfmarker} Yeah . user interface: But the {disfmarker} project manager: Oh yeah and power . That's three buttons and this would cost {disfmarker} industrial designer: Oh . Yeah it's just as expensive as what we have now . user interface: But the integrated uh button ? How many func functions can it uh have ? project manager: Yeah . Three . Up , down , Okay . industrial designer: Yeah endlessly . I mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: You can go into you in you main menu , marketing: You you press it for like three seconds . industrial designer: you can choose uh flip channel , uh you can choose sound options , any options . marketing: Then then then you should do everything in the menu . On the screen . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , okay . It would save enough {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Maybe we should . 'Cause we don't have money and w we want the screen . project manager: Yeah you can choose this , drop these , then we have a half Euro left . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} So we can maybe still use power button . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , but we'd {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Alright . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: I guess we have to . marketing: It s it saves us four Euros and it costs us two and a half . So let's see , we we drop the price by one and a half . project manager: Yeah . You see ? industrial designer: We'll we'll be on {disfmarker} marketing: But we still have thirteen left . project manager: Oh still {disfmarker} Yeah ? Oh then I miscalculated . Oh yeah . marketing: Thirteen . So still half . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Shit . Drop the special colour . {vocalsound} marketing: There goes the special co {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Oh no . marketing: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That would make it less appealing . So that's no option . project manager: {vocalsound} 'Kay . What else ? Uncurved ? user interface: No no , it has to be um curved . marketing: We sure about the advanced chip we need for the display ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah it says right here . project manager: {vocalsound} They made it very easy for us . {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . marketing: Well yeah . {vocalsound} {gap} yeah . We made it hard for ourselves with the display , but it's a cool feature . project manager: Ah , I don't think I can s uh persuade the management to say , this is better for the market so you sell more than {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . Wh what we could do is um {disfmarker} drop the the special colour , and uh do the special colour for the buttons . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Buttons . That's {disfmarker} Oh yeah since we only have one button . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah but I mean what is meant by special colour ? project manager: I just m I don't {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} user interface: Just something else than than black or white I think . project manager: Uh yeah it's {disfmarker} I think it's grey , regular . marketing: S yeah . Alright . project manager: Grey and rubber . industrial designer: But we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though . project manager: Of plastic . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Damn . marketing: So I rather have an hand dynamo {vocalsound} than than drop the colour . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah and then {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah yeah . marketing: You can still play with it then I guess . I don't know . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working . So I guess that isn't an option . user interface: The display {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well , you only have to power it up when you wanna use it . marketing: Yeah . user interface: The {disfmarker} But if you have to power the for ten minutes , {vocalsound} then the {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: I don't know . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: No I don't think the current status of uh chips are pretty uh energy conserving , no . industrial designer: {gap} . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah true . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Let's let's go for the hand dynamo then . project manager: Yeah hand dynamo ? Do you want an extra button ? {vocalsound} marketing: Or or do we {disfmarker} Or do we do uncurved and flat ? Instead of {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: No no it has to be curved . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour . user interface: Yeah . Just put a special special colour of the buttons , or something . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: And a screen . industrial designer: Yeah . That's the most import project manager: Yep ? Instead of an additional power button ? user interface: Yeah or spe special form ? marketing: Yeah . S what what is special f Oh yeah , special form . project manager: Yeah ? marketing: Maybe that's nicer . project manager: It's for scroll {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Without {disfmarker} marketing: But we don't have any buttons . industrial designer: We only have {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} So do {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . But it's it's for the integrated button , I think also . Or {disfmarker} marketing: d Uh make it a special colour then . industrial designer: Yeah but {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah ma make it a special colour then . project manager: Yeah but it's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down . So {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . Okay . Yeah . marketing: Okay . Make it a special colour and then it look fancy . project manager: Yeah ? So {disfmarker} user interface: Yep . project manager: Woah we're within budget . marketing: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} It's a miracle . {vocalsound} user interface: Oh just {disfmarker} marketing: Let's let's save it . user interface: oh ma make it two special colours , but we only have one button . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Okay . marketing: Let's do it like this , I mean , because it does not lose our identity of the product as we {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah ? {vocalsound} Okay . Um , well {disfmarker} {gap} . 'Kay , this was old . industrial designer: Well we come back to the drawing board then , huh ? {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah all your designs are uh pretty much {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah back to work . Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Did I save it ? industrial designer: It's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah but that but that's the fun part of it . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} I I wanted to go , but I wasn't allowed . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Oh yeah ? {gap} okay . marketing: Alright . project manager: Uh I just forgot to save this . Just a minute . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} . marketing: Yeah what's the next uh phase ? project manager: Yeah , this the last phase of course , so {disfmarker} marketing: Uh the agenda . By your humble P_M_ . project manager: Hmm . {vocalsound} Oh . marketing: {vocalsound} Oh f {vocalsound} Frustrated . {vocalsound} Alright . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Well we first should have had a uh prototype presentation . But well as you saw that hadn't made no sense , because we had to drop it . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Drop everything . Yeah . marketing: Drop , yeah . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: We went straight into finance ? {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah it was more important , so I just marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: For {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: pushed up the agenda . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Uh , evaluation criteria . You have t produced something about that ? marketing: Yeah that that's {disfmarker} Yeah . I uh I sure did . And it combines with product evaluation . Uh so {disfmarker} project manager: Uh you put it in the {gap} . marketing: We all have to keep in mind what has changed now . So what we have left on the {disfmarker} Because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Alright . project manager: F_ five . marketing: {vocalsound} Let's make it big . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale , as following . Well the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah . True or false , and then on a scale of seven points , a {gap} scale , as we all know it . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Um {disfmarker} Well the criteria are based on the user requirements , uh the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself . Um well they are in a Word document , which I will open now . project manager: Alt up marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . I don't know it's open yet . No . And we all have to uh agree on a certain level . What's this ? project manager: {vocalsound} Freaky . {vocalsound} marketing: Oh . I don't know . Um {disfmarker} Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user . So that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions . How do you think about that ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} I think it does . Because the operating {gap} behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of L_C_D_ , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: right ? project manager: Uh , of course we dropped a little bit of those uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah the us u It it {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: it's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions , in this question . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: So do you think {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well , we have extended menus , on the on the L_C_D_ screen . So {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . You can you can ma user interface: Yep . marketing: Yeah , you can make a lot of extended menus . That's true . I mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited , to to build in menus in the screen . industrial designer: {vocalsound} I {gap} No . marketing: So on a scale from one to seven , what do you think ? user interface: Two or three . Two or three . marketing: Huh ? Two or three ? Something like that ? project manager: Two . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Well we have to choose one . So uh what do you say ? project manager: Uh y we should fill this in now . marketing: I agree on two . project manager: Yeah okay . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} marketing: I uh I say two , personally . But {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah in the new design I s would say it's three . But now , in original design I say two . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah alright . marketing: Yeah well we have to evaluate I guess what we have now . project manager: Okay then I say three . marketing: Yeah ? You say three , industrial designer: Yeah yeah . marketing: and you you said al also three ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Three ? Okay well I say still two , but it has to be three then . project manager: {vocalsound} Hey , you're marketing , eh . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah I know . So it's made bold . But it's {disfmarker} nah , it's not very clear on the sc project manager: Hmm . M maybe underline . user interface: Or give it a colour . marketing: Maybe other colour , yeah . That's better . project manager: {vocalsound} Red . {vocalsound} marketing: Uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Alright . Oh , it doesn't have to be bold anymore . project manager: {vocalsound} Oh yeah very true . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Alright . Yeah . user interface: Yeah true one . {vocalsound} marketing: Um well the remote control has {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Wha {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} He types everything . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Definitely one . It has to be . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions . For example audio settings and screen settings . user interface: It hides uh basic functions . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Everything . {vocalsound} You don't use anything else . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Well , yeah . So it it's a very true point . I mean it hides all those function . industrial designer: {vocalsound} You're not gonna find them . project manager: Yeah . Yeah okay . Yeah . user interface: Yeah true . marketing: But , I mean uh they're hidden in the screen . If you don't want to use them , you don't s you s just scroll over them . And you place them {disfmarker} project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: {vocalsound} F I don't know where . So that's very true , I guess , for our case . industrial designer: Yeah the next {disfmarker} Not so much so . marketing: Uh the second point . It shows the relevant and most used functions . project manager: Nope . marketing: Power button . Do we ha still have a power button ? project manager: Uh check with the Excel sheet . marketing: Well yeah the button's integrated , huh ? user interface: {vocalsound} I think we are {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah it's uh it's integrated . marketing: Yeah we dropped it . You j you just push it in for {disfmarker} user interface: It's in {disfmarker} Oh yeah it was integrateds . Yeah . project manager: Yeah integrate it . marketing: Yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something , and then {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: E exactly just like a m mobile . marketing: Yeah . I don't know . {vocalsound} project manager: Just go scrolling and it will activate . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . Um it shows the relevant and most used functions . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} . marketing: Yeah uh on the other {disfmarker} uh on one side I would say yes , and the other side I would say no . So it's {disfmarker} I don't know . project manager: It shows the most used functions and they are relevant , but {disfmarker} user interface: Can you uh change channels directly with with just one button ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: No , you have to scroll through the menu , before marketing: With the scroll butt Yeah and then say channel . And then {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . So it's it's not {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something , if {disfmarker} When it's on , yeah , it's turned on , project manager: You say you double click on the {disfmarker} marketing: Hmm ? industrial designer: It automatically has the the programme and the volume function , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some {gap} {disfmarker} Of you {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Or you double click it . marketing: But but how do you change from volume to channel ? project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: No because it has four arrows , right ? project manager: No , not anymore . user interface: No . {vocalsound} marketing: No . {vocalsound} project manager: Because he's {gap} now have a scroll-wheel that you can push in . industrial designer: Oh yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Like on the the mouse . industrial designer: Yeah I was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick . marketing: No we have n we have no buttons left . So {vocalsound} industrial designer: Say . marketing: the joystick was not an option . industrial designer: Yeah that is a bummer . marketing: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so you hav {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: So you you have to double-click , I mean , for , I mean , uh volume , project manager: To get into menu . Yeah . marketing: and three double click for the menu , or something . user interface: {vocalsound} Oh no . project manager: {vocalsound} Or hold it ten seconds . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} We'll make it a Morse code . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . Alright . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: But but ease of use was not very important , may I remind you . project manager: No no no . Uh it should be trendy . {vocalsound} marketing: So that's {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah but that that's not a question . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Well I think it's pretty much in the middle . project manager: Yeah . Four . marketing: You have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen , in the menu . So {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , im {disfmarker} in the menu . user interface: Seven . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So maybe it's more like a f a five . Or {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . Five . industrial designer: Yeah I would go for five or six , yeah . marketing: Yeah . Five or six ? project manager: Five . user interface: Five . Yep . industrial designer: Okay five . marketing: Five ? Alright . industrial designer: Let's not diss our remote . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: It's the weirdest remote control I've ever seen . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Oh . {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: Yep . Just one button . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Well it's different . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Alright . Uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . industrial designer: But {disfmarker} Uh yep . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Well yeah but we dropped the speech recognition . But it has at least one innovation . project manager: Yeah , it's still {disfmarker} Yeah , I say two . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} We still have the fruit and vegetable print . marketing: I say two then . project manager: Oh , that's the next . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that that's not that's not this question . Uh thi uh that's the other question . industrial designer: Fr Oh I mean the {disfmarker} Oh never mind . I'm a bit lost . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: This one . user interface: I think a two . No . project manager: Two . marketing: Two yeah . industrial designer: {gap} . user interface: Yep . marketing: I think L_C_D_'s more useful than speech {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah definitely . marketing: What ? Oh not the bold one . industrial designer: It's way more practical , yeah . marketing: Right . Okay , it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints , primary colours and sponge-like material . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} It should have been two questions . {vocalsound} I realise now , because {vocalsound} sponge-like material is dropped . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: But the look and feel {disfmarker} project manager: You still have rubber d Or no . industrial designer: Yeah . So we still uh we still have the primary colours . But only on the on the outside , not on the button . user interface: No you got a plastic . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: The button has also colour . Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah ? project manager: {vocalsound} The one button we have . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . The one . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve . project manager: Yeah you could check with the Excel sheet . marketing: Mm mm . user interface: Yeah . You only have one {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: Yeah we have single curve now , industrial designer: And and colour . marketing: and no and no material industrial designer: Yeah . S marketing: . So maybe in the middle or something . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Four . Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , I mean it's project manager: Yeah or three . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} marketing: worth the {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: We have something . industrial designer: Actually we d we didn't do so well on this one . Because it's basically an old one , uh with little curve on the side , and in a different colour . Still , it's still hard . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: I mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape , that would give it something young and fresh . project manager: New . Yeah . marketing: Yeah . But then we would have to drop the screen . user interface: Red . {vocalsound} marketing: Oh red . Yeah . project manager: You like both . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} I like bold . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh the remote control displays the corporate logo . {vocalsound} project manager: Um oh yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} Mm yeah yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Of course . project manager: {vocalsound} I just couldn't {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} You just have to draw it . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Um , just one minute . user interface: It's the white part uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah but it {disfmarker} be because uh we couldn't hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen , we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the {disfmarker} project manager: {gap} . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So {disfmarker} user interface: We have a we have a {disfmarker} industrial designer: So I mean I wanted to put digits on the buttons as well . But {disfmarker} marketing: But there's uh enough space for the corporate logo . I mean , {vocalsound} if there's only one thing . industrial designer: Hell yeah . If we have only one button . marketing: Yeah . So I will say that is very true . project manager: {gap} . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: And even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an R_ and the reversed R_ , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: doesn't it ? marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} The remote control is easy to use . Well I would say {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: No . marketing: Skill , uh I would say six , or something . I don't think it's easy to use , or not so . industrial designer: {vocalsound} The only e the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers . 'Cause it has only one button . user interface: Ah i marketing: Yeah . user interface: And that you only have to control one button . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah exactly . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . It it it has a nice screen . But {disfmarker} Yeah . user interface: It gives visual feedback . So {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . Well I I would say a five or a six . user interface: I think a five . Five . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} I would say six . marketing: What do you say ? Easy to use ? Five or a six ? industrial designer: It's really not easy to use . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: No not anymore . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: 'Cause you're putting everything {disfmarker} marketing: So a six , more . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , uh I would go for the six too . So {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . Yeah . industrial designer: Most votes count . Um {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Um well , another question , user interface: Yeah that looks uh great . marketing: uh the remote control is durable . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: I don't know if that's the correct word . user interface: Yeah . Nah {disfmarker} industrial designer: Definitely in casing , 'cause we have a hard plastic marketing: But uh {disfmarker} In use , both battery as casing ? industrial designer: {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah because the the batteries , those thingies last forever . marketing: Yeah ? True , true . industrial designer: And the the casing , hard plastic also lasts forever . marketing: And the casing is plastic , {gap} ? user interface: Yep . marketing: Yeah . If you don't drop it too much , it's uh should last pretty long . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: So I would go for one . marketing: Yeah ? But uh I think rubber compared is better . So I think a two is more appropriate user interface: Yeah . S project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: Yep . industrial designer: Okay yeah . marketing: than {disfmarker} user interface: Wow . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . Logo . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay I will go {disfmarker} go for two . {vocalsound} Uh the last one ? The remote control's a good example for company's motto , we put the fashion in electronics . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Oh . No m user interface: No we put the electronics into the fashion . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah well {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} I would g marketing: {vocalsound} {gap} uh {disfmarker} {gap} turn around . Yeah . But um {disfmarker} industrial designer: I would go for four . project manager: No {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah ? industrial designer: Because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have . marketing: It's not {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , true . project manager: Yeah okay . marketing: So a four . It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it g it g goes , it's not the best we could do , I guess . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: But it all has to do with the budget , because it's it's not the bad idea we had , so {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah yeah . user interface: Yeah , four is okay . marketing: Alright , yeah . Right . project manager: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: That's it . marketing: So if I understood it right , we have to count these numbers . project manager: Ooh . And {disfmarker} Yeah ? What ? marketing: Uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Mm-hmm . Oh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . marketing: Oh {disfmarker} Alright . Word document , the {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . That {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah we have to count them . project manager: Count them . Add them ? Or {disfmarker} marketing: Uh {disfmarker} Yeah just add them and then uh divide them . project manager: Could somebody start calculator ? {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Mm . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Ah we can do the math . Uh {disfmarker} marketing: I all made it po I I all made it user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: I all made it possible uh for a positive questions , so we can count it . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: I mean if you have reversed question , you have to reverse the scale , project manager: Yeah , yeah . You have to {disfmarker} marketing: uh {disfmarker} Yes . project manager: 'Kay . So four and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . Did you make this questionnaire or what ? marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} Thanks . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Nice work . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Oh . user interface: Three plus ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} I wouldn't be able to do it that fast . project manager: O one . user interface: Plus one . project manager: Plus five . user interface: Plus five ? marketing: {vocalsound} Oh {disfmarker} Easy . project manager: Bo {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Question number four , yeah ? project manager: Uh two . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Four . user interface: Oh . Wait a second . Oh . {vocalsound} industrial designer: F project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: It's it's gone wrong . marketing: {vocalsound} How hard is it ? user interface: Okay . It's your turn . industrial designer: Pretty difficult . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah just use {disfmarker} project manager: Start over ? user interface: No it's if you press twice on the plus button , then you get s s marketing: Oh there tho uh there's no n There's no num pads . project manager: You can {disfmarker} Oh yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: No . That's why it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} It's a it's a bit uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Just type in the digits . They're all one digit numbers right ? And then you can count them together . marketing: Yeah . I think you can just count them by a {disfmarker} user interface: Just count it to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: Um let's move over . project manager: Okay . Three , four , nine . marketing: Three , plus one , four . Nine . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Uh , yeah . Are you here ? industrial designer: Eleven . marketing: Eleven . project manager: Eleven , industrial designer: Fifteen . marketing: Fifteen . project manager: fifteen . user interface: Sixteen . industrial designer: Sixteen . marketing: Sixteen , yeah . industrial designer: Seventeen . project manager: Seventeen . marketing: No sixteen . Uh sixteen plus six . industrial designer: Oh what ? user interface: Twenty two . {vocalsound} project manager: S Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} How hard is this ? {vocalsound} marketing: Twenty two . Twenty two , yeah ? user interface: Twenty four . Twenty six . industrial designer: Never mind . Twenty four . Twenty eight . marketing: Tw user interface: Oh , sorry . {gap} . marketing: Twenty {disfmarker} Twenty eight . project manager: That was the last one . That was that . user interface: {vocalsound} Oh my . industrial designer: Twenty eight . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Okay . Twenty eight . project manager: So divided by nine . marketing: Twen Uh okay . By nine . user interface: Hmm . marketing: That's uh three uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Or le less than a three . project manager: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah the lower the {disfmarker} The lower the score the better , right ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . Twenty eight industrial designer: Yeah but {disfmarker} project manager: Divided by nine . marketing: di divided by nine project manager: So thr t two . marketing: makes three point one one one one one one one . project manager: So we're better than average . industrial designer: But {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: I Are you sure we {disfmarker} this number actually tells us somethings ? project manager: No . {vocalsound} industrial designer: I don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Some questions are {disfmarker} Yeah . industrial designer: So if you give a true to a positive , it actually means that the low {disfmarker} the lower the better . But if you give true to a negative question {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , but there are no negative questions I guess . industrial designer: No ? marketing: Good example . Durable use . industrial designer: Durable , that's good . marketing: Easy to use . This {gap} is good . industrial designer: Easy to use . {vocalsound} marketing: Fancy look and feel , that's good . industrial designer: Yeah . {gap} . marketing: Technology innovation was good , because of a marketing uh requirement . industrial designer: Also good . Yeah okay . marketing: Re relevant most used function . industrial designer: I guess you did do it . marketing: And hides these functions . {vocalsound} That was also a good thing . user interface: Oh yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: Oh yeah yeah . No {disfmarker} marketing: And then matches the opera of the {gap} user was also a good thing . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . Okay . marketing: So it were all positive questions , by uh by purpose . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah true . marketing: Yes , so the {disfmarker} It tells us something , yes . Becau But the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those uh those things , I guess . user interface: Oh great . project manager: Things , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah definitely definitely . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Because now it's just an average {disfmarker} It's remote . marketing: Yeah . Nah it it's it's better than average , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah okay because of the L_C_D_ screen . But uh it looks and stuff , it still uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . So th project manager: It's still {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Has some shortcomings . industrial designer: it's not , it's not really eye-catching , except for the colour . marketing: No . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: The colour and the screen . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um this we had , this we had . We have to do a product evaluation . industrial designer: Product evaluation . project manager: {vocalsound} Uh prototype presentation we dropped . So {disfmarker} Uh the finance we looked . We have redesigned . Uh not on that , but {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} So you can just make one big L_C_D_ screen . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Okay it's your turn now . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Shall we try ? marketing: {vocalsound} With some casing around it , yeah . industrial designer: Black . Okay uh we're still gonna go for the fancy colours ? project manager: Yeah uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: But are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah we we can just uh use this one . And then uh over-paint it with uh uh the green uh {disfmarker} project manager: The the button has a special colour , the frame has a special colour . marketing: Yeah . user interface: he only needs one button . industrial designer: One scroll button and {disfmarker} project manager: It's plastic . {vocalsound} And single curved . user interface: Yeah . Or we have to delete this one or {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Oh and you might want to add a uh infrared LED . user interface: {vocalsound} Oh {disfmarker} oh no . {vocalsound} marketing: Oh yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Otherwise it uh doesn't function uh so well . industrial designer: For what ? user interface: Okay . marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: So that's {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Do we have to do other things ? project manager: Well I have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far . marketing: Or just redesign ? {vocalsound} Alright . project manager: And I try to get chip just before uh I uh receive the Excel sheet . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So I {disfmarker} marketing: So you made a start , right ? project manager: Yeah I'm I'm somewhere , but maybe you can help me . industrial designer: Should give it some time ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yay . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} user interface: Okay , but how do we make the the scroll uh button ? project manager: I was here . So {disfmarker} user interface: It's just one {disfmarker} industrial designer: Have to take this away also . marketing: Alright . user interface: yeah . project manager: Ah {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: And this um {disfmarker} user interface: Uh that's the infrared uh {vocalsound} thing . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Oh yeah , of course . marketing: The the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables , like primary colours , spongy shape . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Um pen yeah ? Format . Current colour red . marketing: The playfulness , we decided to use kinetic energy as a power sour industrial designer: Oh {disfmarker} Yeah we did our special colour for the {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: Line widths , now that's a ten . marketing: That's conceptual , yes . project manager: That's enough to get started with , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . Um , uh it's just a scroll {disfmarker} marketing: Mm . industrial designer: It's gonna be one str scroll . user interface: Yeah , is it's horizontal or vertical ? marketing: How many pages ? {vocalsound} project manager: Uh , I just took one for every step and then a conclusion . user interface: I think {disfmarker} marketing: Alright . Y you have you have done the first two . industrial designer: Horizontal's easier too , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: 'cause you can {disfmarker} marketing: Okay , and and the look and feel is {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Is it more natural than this ? project manager: Well I think I have to make a p an issue called finance . user interface: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: So let's say {disfmarker} Whoops . 'Kay . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Basically . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} It doesn't look like uh {disfmarker} marketing: The items we had to drop . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . user interface: Uh it {disfmarker} it's it's not {disfmarker} Yeah . It's not very fashionable anymore . But uh it's okay . industrial designer: It's really ugly . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Where did we start with price ? user interface: Maybe m make it bigger ? Or {disfmarker} marketing: Twenty six and a half . project manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} marketing: Or not ? Or twenty six ? Something like that . user interface: Yeah . That looks little bit more uh {disfmarker} Maybe that's a s a special colour for it . So we can make it uh special ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: Oh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: This ? industrial designer: What do you mean ? Like a other colour than this one ? user interface: {vocalsound} Or or speckles in it ? I dunno . Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Speckles ? user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah can we do it uh {disfmarker} uh can we do a print ? user interface: ..$ I'm not sure . project manager: ... . I don't think so , if you see the options . But {disfmarker} industrial designer: I think we have to choose , yeah ? marketing: Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay special colour . We do have special colour . user interface: Yeah red is already a special colour , I think . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Does it mean uh that {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} It's not very special , but uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty ? user interface: Yeah . Just uh put the purple uh purple on it . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Purdy . marketing: Yeah . Some some big dots . industrial designer: Purple ? user interface: That's trendy . industrial designer: Yeah yeah . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Oh no my remote has acne . marketing: ... . We have the original balance sheet , or {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . user interface: Woah . industrial designer: No . That's why we have that button . project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Oh yeah . industrial designer: It's so cute . user interface: Hmm . Oh what ? industrial designer: Doh . marketing: Woah . user interface: {gap} ? marketing: {vocalsound} Just cut . Control Z_ . user interface: Oh no . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Is that that ? project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: No no . Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: How the {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} did we do that ? user interface: Oh it's it's just one computer ? Or {disfmarker} marketing: Just dual screen . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: No . But can we delete it , just with delete ? Or {disfmarker} industrial designer: We can try . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: That doesn't respond also to the undo . It looks like it's {disfmarker} user interface: Crashed . {vocalsound} Oh , no . industrial designer: No , {gap} {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Very nice . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Where do you want some more dots ? project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , over here . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} You can't even draw anymore . user interface: Hmm ? marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Y y you you {vocalsound} user interface: What's this ? project manager: Even children can draw . {vocalsound} marketing: you push the button or something . Or {disfmarker} project manager: Can you just push pen and then keep on {disfmarker} user interface: Oh yeah . Oh that's the select button . project manager: Hmm . user interface: It's uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay , it's not the prettiest , I know . user interface: No , it looks {disfmarker} industrial designer: It's not so random huh ? marketing: Lot of options . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: It's okay . Specially the the R_ . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , the R_ and another R_ . industrial designer: Yeah okay . marketing: It's called the Real Remote , right ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: Maybe maybe it c it can say that . The Real Remote . project manager: Yeah just on the the m um the L_C_D_ display . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Welcome . {vocalsound} project manager: This is your Real Remote . {vocalsound} industrial designer: We can make a l a logo . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: Like uh {gap} put it like the shape . project manager: Yeah . user interface: D designed by {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Something like that . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: I mean it's not too uh {disfmarker} That's not their logo , is it ? user interface: No . Do they have a lo {disfmarker} Oh , the {disfmarker} here . This i this is the logo . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Two R_s and a one {disfmarker} industrial designer: It's a {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . You can just reuse that , because the name is the same . Initials . user interface: {gap} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: You can copy and paste the picture if you want . industrial designer: How {gap} {disfmarker} Shall we do the logo in black or not ? project manager: Mm . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} What is that ? Look more {disfmarker} Looks more like a campfire . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Are you dissing my drawing ? {vocalsound} This one ? marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: It looks like a ribbon . {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} . Yeah . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: So who wants to draw ? This is actually quite fun . Do we need to do anything ? user interface: Are we uh ready ? Uh {disfmarker} Or {disfmarker} industrial designer: I hear you people are typing . marketing: Type in your report . industrial designer: Oh , okay . marketing: I don't see any new messages . So {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Luckily . marketing: Hmm ? Luckily , yeah . user interface: Is this uh the last assignment ? Or {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , it's uh user interface: Final {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: {disfmarker} Yeah . industrial designer: It's almost four . marketing: What time do we have to deliver the report ? Four o'clock or {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} At four , yeah , {gap} ? marketing: Or before that ? project manager: Okay .

Or something . marketing: within a mirror , yeah . project manager: {gap} {vocalsound} {gap} . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So it looks like a big screen , but {gap} {disfmarker} in fact it isn't . industrial designer: So are we gonna change anything to this ? user interface: It is {disfmarker} industrial designer: I mean is it gonna {disfmarker} marketing: Well it's it's single single curved . project manager: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: It's now single curved . So {disfmarker} It's flat . Oh no . industrial designer: This is gonna be flat . Yeah exactly . marketing: Th this is flat . Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . It doesn't matter . It's it's {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: But it's it's better to have in the front , this kind of shape , because it looks nice . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: I mean you see more of this than of that . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , more like that . industrial designer: Yeah . And this is also gonna be {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} It's not very uh ideal . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Nope . marketing: Do like this . industrial designer: But sometimes then uh all of a sudden it does work . marketing: Yeah . What's this ? user interface: {vocalsound} That's the detector uh for the {disfmarker} marketing: Ooh . user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Maybe {disfmarker} marketing: But I don't see a detector over there . user interface: Yeah . I don't know . industrial designer: {vocalsound} No it's {disfmarker} I think you only need two points . Or not . No , you sh marketing: I thought it was a kind of thing to put it on , and then draw right lines or something . user interface: Maybe that's why it's it's not working , because it's more {disfmarker} industrial designer: Slanted yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} Or just messed it up . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well maybe . user interface: Oh . {vocalsound} Oh yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah it it matters for the aim of this thing . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah but it wasn't good . {vocalsound} user interface: You've to make it s uh ninety degrees . marketing: Yeah it it has to touch the corners , I guess . But th this one wasn't good , because if I was drawing here , I drew a line and then it came over here . project manager: {vocalsound} Um now you probably have to recalibrate . user interface: You have {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Oh , five minutes to the end of the meeting . user interface: Oh we're always long . marketing: Oh . project manager: {vocalsound} And the recalibration is done using this icon here . user interface: Yeah , can we t can we get to that @ i marketing: Ooh . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Oh it's not working anymore . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah well I just {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah , it's it's okay .

Yeah but it's better , it's better {disfmarker} user interface: No it {disfmarker} industrial designer: 'Cause this one makes the angle either like this . So i if I change this , it will go there , if I change that , will go there . marketing: Mm . No . It's better than it was I guess . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . I will take this away 'cause it looks messy . marketing: {vocalsound} Silly . Yeah . Works pretty well . Five minutes before the meeting's over . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: And then ? project manager: Then I have to uh uh write this , marketing: We have to present {disfmarker} project manager: and I don't know if you have to present , because I didn't receive any information about that so far . marketing: Alright . industrial designer: Maybe we will . project manager: Maybe we get a a final mail . marketing: So it {disfmarker} after the {disfmarker} after after these five minutes , you have to {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah , I have still ten minutes to finish the report . industrial designer: What's this anyway ? user interface: So cake . {vocalsound} marketing: Alright . After after that five minutes , you have ten minutes to finish it , or {disfmarker} industrial designer: It looks like candle wax . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Alright . And we uh {disfmarker} project manager: And you can uh just uh relax and uh have cup of coffee or {disfmarker} marketing: Right . Chill . {vocalsound} project manager: oh no , they don't have beer here so you can't celebrate . marketing: Huh . project manager: You can just if you ma finish my presentation please .

So if you finish that then you'll see uh {disfmarker} Yeah next . marketing: Next slide . project manager: Oh yeah , we have to do the project uh evaluation . Just uh do that quickly . marketing: Yeah ? project manager: Uh {disfmarker} marketing: How do you do it ? project manager: Uh well basically what that says , we discuss it and um {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Alright . project manager: So how were {disfmarker} did the project process uh go ? Did you , were you all pleased with the process as it was ? Or are there uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh th uh do you mean the the interaction between us ? Or {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah the interaction and the steps we followed , and and so forth . industrial designer: Yeah well at first I was really stressed . Because it went a bit fast . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on , the second time I think I did a bit better . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: And the third time yeah , I mean {disfmarker} marketing: And we move more to to working together as team , user interface: No . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: because at first you you make your individual contribution , and then come here , and you have no idea what the others have to make . project manager: {vocalsound} {gap} . user interface: No . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah yeah yeah . marketing: And then finally you have some idea , okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that , project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own . So {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah we {disfmarker} marketing: The process , I mean , the interaction between us became better and better I guess . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . Especially after the first meeting . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: And {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , especially if f f if you see {disfmarker} uh you se you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting I guess . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . Definitely . project manager: Okay and was that due to my leadership ? {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah yeah yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well you did become more assertive the the second time round , so that {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . You were more in charge kind of thing . project manager: That okay ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . Um was there uh enough room for creativity ? industrial designer: I guess so . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah but only the the financial parts uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: I mean {disfmarker} marketing: Li Limiteded afterwards , user interface: Yeah . marketing: but {disfmarker} If if you don't take that into account , there's plenty of room for creativ creativity . industrial designer: I marketing: Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself , but also in explaining it to the other people , by means of uh industrial designer: We were pretty democratic . marketing: the the board and uh PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that . project manager: So and the {disfmarker} uh about the board {gap} digital pen ? Uh was that helpful or {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Ooh . marketing: Mm uh I think in in essence project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard . Because it it it just works better . project manager: Yeah it works . {vocalsound} marketing: I mean uh uh I've made {disfmarker} yeah , uh I've made several notes just to test it , and and just put the pen in into it , and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly . user interface: Yeah . marketing: So it it's better a better device than uh project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Maybe {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: than the screen . But the screen is useful , in essence , but it doesn't work that well . {vocalsound} industrial designer: It's uh it's {disfmarker} The the pen is more intuitive , 'cause we're all used to writing with pen . project manager: {vocalsound} Use the pen . industrial designer: And uh as I said , uh I uh have no idea how PowerPoint works , so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: But once I get to know the program probably , I mean , it looks better , you know . Or uh something like that . You can give it a kind of a home style , like we have i the the logo and everything . project manager: Yeah yeah . industrial designer: And {disfmarker} I don't know . marketing: Yep . project manager: Blink . Oh . {vocalsound} marketing: Warning . Finish meeting now . user interface: Finish meeting . project manager: Okay , are are there {vocalsound} any new ideas about this ? All I think {disfmarker} marketing: Well , it {disfmarker} project manager: I didn't really receive , yeah . marketing: It's use especially useful , I guess , to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff . project manager: {vocalsound} Uh uh w uh {disfmarker} marketing: And and project manager: S sorry uh {disfmarker} marketing: the {gap} screen and stuff like that . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: I think the PowerPoint is is too limited . You can't uh draw easy in in PowerPoint . It has to be uh {disfmarker} yeah . The drawing board has to be integrated into PowerPoint , so that you can just easily {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: You know , you can draw something on the sketch-board and then take it there , or whatever . marketing: Yeah . Yeah . But it it's useful to to show something to to an {disfmarker} a small audience , and then to {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah just for text , for text it's uh it's okay . But {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . These these kind of screens this size are useful to discuss things . So {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Oh . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yes . Check your email . project manager: Uh we should uh enter our questionnaire . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} You also . {vocalsound} user interface: 'Kay . project manager: Ah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Woah . industrial designer: Alright . marketing: Right . project manager: Okay .
