marketing: Okay . project manager: 'Kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . Welcome everybody . Um hope your sessions went well . Um so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . Um I've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . Um I I'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet . Right . Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this {disfmarker} marketing: And I can start if you want . Mm . project manager: sure . marketing: Is there an order ? No . project manager: Hm ? marketing: We haven't decided on an order . project manager: No , any any order's fine . Yeah . marketing: First . Okay . Um , how do I put this {disfmarker} industrial designer: Just uh {disfmarker} marketing: I'll just put the cable in . project manager: Oh yeah , sorry . marketing: {gap} Is that it ? Can you see ? {vocalsound} Oh , here . Okay . So what happens it doesn't work ? project manager: It sh it takes a few seconds I think . industrial designer: You may need to {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Who's that ? {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: No . industrial designer: But sometimes you have to do it {disfmarker} marketing: Is it in the right thing ? industrial designer: it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F_ eight . marketing: Oh wait , um . Uh . You need to help me . {vocalsound} project manager: Uh-huh , and then press function . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: and F_ eight . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Could you just plug it back into hers because she had {disfmarker} marketing: Oh , wait . user interface: oh . marketing: That's {disfmarker} is that it ? industrial designer: Adjusting . project manager: Here we are . {vocalsound} industrial designer: The cable might be a little loose or something . Oh , you got it . marketing: Right here we are . project manager: Oh . Is it on ? marketing: We're here . project manager: Okay . marketing: Okay , um . In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . I don't know what R_S_I_ means . Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue . project manager: Hm . marketing: Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than {disfmarker} you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together . {vocalsound} And that's all I have to say about the matter , {vocalsound} um . project manager: 'Kay . marketing: Shall I {disfmarker} what do I do ? Do I give this to someone else ? project manager: Yeah . Just move right on . user interface: Right . So get this . Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ? project manager: {vocalsound} Uh function F_ eight . marketing: Function F_ eight . user interface: 'Kay . What's function ? project manager: It's the little blue {disfmarker} w it's the one {disfmarker} th user interface: Oh function , I see it . project manager: yeah . Yeah should be {disfmarker} user interface: There we go . {vocalsound} project manager: It should be {gap} yeah . user interface: Okay . Um . This my presentation about the uh technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on um {vocalsound} just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . So uh and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet {vocalsound} . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: And okay so basically um {vocalsound} I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . Um {vocalsound} so I think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that {disfmarker} like close together that um {vocalsound} are used in the same way , uh {vocalsound} or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh {disfmarker} can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_ . Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? Um {vocalsound} does it do {disfmarker} or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ? And then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ? And um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um I dunno if this will work but {disfmarker} And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . {vocalsound} Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um {vocalsound} like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . {vocalsound} That concludes my presentation . project manager: {gap} user interface: Okay . You need the little thingy . Ooh . industrial designer: How do I um {disfmarker} marketing: S That's on view . industrial designer: Right . marketing: Oh . industrial designer: Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall . And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . So that concludes my presentation . project manager: 'Kay . user interface: Do you know about like {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm ? user interface: I dunno , you seem like you know about {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , uh I d I was an engineer before I came here . user interface: Okay . Cool . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . Well thank you everybody . Um {vocalsound} we have {disfmarker} we'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . Um , teletext is apparently outdated , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . Um , industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable I guess . Um if we have something {disfmarker} I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . Okay . Um . So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . Um , yeah . {vocalsound} Do {disfmarker} Let's {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: I guess we should yeah make some kind of brainstorming , see what we can {disfmarker} user interface: Like in terms of marketing: How it looks or {disfmarker} user interface: how it looks , or like what it does ? project manager: wha what {disfmarker} um {vocalsound} well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and I dunno the the s user interface: Okay . project manager: the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . So . user interface: Yeah . Okay . So {disfmarker} Is our target group then people {disfmarker} so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? project manager: {vocalsound} I think that seems to {disfmarker} yeah . Mm . user interface: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: It's easy to implement . user interface: Okay . So the {disfmarker} marketing: {gap} the the buzzer you mean , user interface: yeah , yeah , yeah . industrial designer: Locator . marketing: yeah , for sure , yeah . user interface: So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , project manager: Yeah , teenagers and young professionals . user interface: what was it ? marketing: Well that's for speech recognition . project manager: Oh , uh . industrial designer: Well {disfmarker} user interface: Oh . marketing: And screen . That's only for speech recognition and screen . industrial designer: I was thinking about that but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: and also , if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one , marketing: Yeah yeah yeah . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: or {disfmarker} it seems like a silly , user interface: Yeah . marketing: I mean {disfmarker} industrial designer: I'm not sure how you would implement it . user interface: Yeah . marketing: I just put the values {vocalsound} in . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: And if if you consider our budget , it probably {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: But um the screen is the same as what , {gap} industrial designer: It's a cool idea but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , I'm happy with that . project manager: Yeah {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Right so um {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: Hu yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Completely . user interface: Okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a {disfmarker} like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the T_V_ itself . industrial designer: Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place {gap} since the T_V_ already has power . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . user interface: Okay . Okay . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably . user interface: Alright . marketing: Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can {disfmarker} industrial designer: It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote {vocalsound} . project manager: right . Yeah , yeah . marketing: So do you plug it in the T_ {disfmarker} you plug it in T_V_ , this thing ? industrial designer: Yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ so if you need to find the remote , click the button . marketing: Okay . Okay . user interface: So it's now like a two-part thing . industrial designer: Yeah , so it would be a two part package . user interface: Okay . Alright . marketing: Okay . user interface: So we get to design that too . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Make it fashionable . Um , okay . project manager: So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals . industrial designer: Yeah I think so . marketing: Yeah . Just there . project manager: Huh . Okay . marketing: Mm . Are we um should that thing be on the {vocalsound} thing to put the {disfmarker} you s you talking about a home for it . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ? project manager: We probably leave that . I mean I guess one takes care of the other , like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . user interface: Yeah . Then it can live anywhere . project manager: Yeah {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Okay . For the {disfmarker} so you have that button , that {disfmarker} so there's {disfmarker} is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ? industrial designer: Um on the T_V_ or on the phone ? marketing: Are we just having a radio ? On the phone . industrial designer: Um it seemed like a {disfmarker} a beep seemed the most reasonable to me , user interface: T marketing: You don't need a light . Yeah yeah yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: I think that's what the phone has , marketing: Yeah yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: I mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it {vocalsound} and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever . project manager: And like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so marketing: You can hear it's under the couch yeah . project manager: {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: So i Yeah . marketing: Um , {vocalsound} {gap} So need the other buttons . So we have this {disfmarker} mm . project manager: So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r I don't remember who showed them {vocalsound} , yeah you you did um , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: That was that was me . marketing: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} project manager: they're {disfmarker} I mean one looked like it was for V_C_R_ type thing , and the other looked like just television . user interface: I think w I think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes . project manager: Oh really . 'Cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities . user interface: And uh industrial designer: Does anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across {disfmarker} international ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: They're not {disfmarker} no . marketing: They're not , no . industrial designer: Okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s . user interface: S project manager: Yeah , that's right , yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} It not V_H_S_ here ? project manager: But D_V_D_ probably is . industrial designer: Yeah , other than that region and coding thing . user interface: Um {disfmarker} project manager: And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type , that's the the technology these days . marketing: But V_C_R_s {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , for sure . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . So . Okay , let's see if I can {disfmarker} I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take {disfmarker} like just reduce the number of buttons you know , project manager: Yeah . user interface: like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_ . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Well for sure we need the um {disfmarker} I think we can just design the channels ? I mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much , project manager: S user interface: Yeah . project manager: Huh . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . marketing: s and it's usually that red user interface: Yeah . marketing: and I think it's quite nice to keep it like red . user interface: Yeah . project manager: You know , I've seen some remotes that {disfmarker} where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . So you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just {disfmarker} marketing: Oh okay , yeah . user interface: It seems like that would be hard though . project manager: But {disfmarker} user interface: I mean , like because unless you know {disfmarker} project manager: It might be confusing . Yeah . user interface: yeah . Just 'cause I wouldn't {disfmarker} I would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . Besides you like to be able to go power . industrial designer: Yeah , I never think to hold something down . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} I have the power {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . B {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: I guess . So we definitely want a power button and numbers . Right . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Well even um iPod thing {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , like um , I don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of user interface: That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah . marketing: scrolling {disfmarker} I don't know . project manager: Mm . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . Because people li seem {disfmarker} now the iPod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no {disfmarker} Know you don't have one two three four five {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , yeah . I think that's an interesting idea , 'cause it's cool , project manager: Mm . user interface: it's it's funny like you f like I just {disfmarker} I don't have an iPod but like I , you know , I just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day , and you just sort of and {disfmarker} it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , like it's not that hard , you know . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah yeah , it's just {disfmarker} and it's one thing which has everything . user interface: Yeah , and it is {disfmarker} yeah . It is really {disfmarker} but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ? marketing: Well can't it tell the {disfmarker} like can't you {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner . user interface: Yeah . Okay . marketing: you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . Yeah . Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button . project manager: Oh that's gonna {disfmarker} Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of {disfmarker} user interface: Like a disc . Yeah . Yeah . It's like {disfmarker} it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad . project manager: okay . I've never used one . No . marketing: It's like l this {disfmarker} like that , and then you do that . project manager: Okay . Okay . user interface: Yeah . Yeah and then . marketing: And then you can have um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing {vocalsound} like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus . user interface: Okay . So like it's like a little part of the circle that {disfmarker} Or it {disfmarker} oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , you can {disfmarker} project manager: Well i user interface: zap . marketing: Yeah , click o actually click on to have {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . project manager: We could we could even have four buttons , like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . So volume could be like the top it and the bottom {disfmarker} So do you need to {disfmarker} industrial designer: Doesn't it rotate though , user interface: okay . industrial designer: so it'll be moving around . user interface: Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like {disfmarker} marketing: What do you mean the function ? user interface: I mean like okay , 'cause so {disfmarker} I dunno , I guess {disfmarker} Okay {disfmarker} so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise . That that means you're gonna go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: But then {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: so if you wanna switch to the {disfmarker} to u do you have to switch to a function where like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down . marketing: Yeah but it knows for some reason . user interface: It just {disfmarker} marketing: The iPod knows . user interface: It just kno {vocalsound} the iPod knows . {vocalsound} S project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} If it works on an iPod then it works . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Huh . user interface: Yeah . So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want . industrial designer: I don't have one . marketing: Well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up . user interface: Okay . That's what I mean . Okay . Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down . industrial designer: Oh . project manager: So it's like holding {disfmarker} marketing: And then {disfmarker} well if you do that it goes , but if you {disfmarker} like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here , that I've seen . project manager: You can {disfmarker} o And you you {disfmarker} is there an extra actual button ? Or are you actually {disfmarker} you're just using the mouse to go up and down . marketing: Well what you {disfmarker} project manager: Like {disfmarker} user interface: It's like a b marketing: for the iPod you press an {disfmarker} w right if you're on the channel let's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down . project manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Right . Mm-hmm . marketing: But if you wanna keep it with volume here and here , I'm pretty sure {disfmarker} project manager: Well I mean if if you're gonna this for channels , right , then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: Like you could just have {disfmarker} marketing: I don't know , project manager: Oh , like {disfmarker} marketing: you could click and then have it up and down , project manager: Oh you could actually {disfmarker} user interface: Like {disfmarker} marketing: but I think {disfmarker} user interface: I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod . marketing: Yeah yeah yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah {vocalsound} . user interface: But the only thing is like , iPods are so expensive , like , it has to be {disfmarker} is that part of {disfmarker} project manager: Is that what makes them expensi I think it's all of {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} I don't think so . user interface: yeah , I dunno , I dunno . project manager: they have so much memory though , that's {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} user interface: You don't think so ? Okay . industrial designer: I don't think it's the wheel dealy . marketing: I think it {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . I think it's the uh h it's their capabili I mean they {disfmarker} it can hold what like five thousand songs or something . user interface: Okay . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} . user interface: Yeah . I'm thinking we could {disfmarker} if if we're hav So ba I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know . industrial designer: And they're re-programmable aren't they ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: You can put on your songs and then put on a different set , project manager: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: that's probably why they're expensive , they're like little computers . user interface: Yeah . project manager: S user interface: Yeah . Well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah yeah yeah . Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass . Because , the other thing , I didn't tell you all my presentation {vocalsound} , is that people find it {disfmarker} find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote user interface: Yeah . marketing: and that's another thing they complained about . project manager: Mm . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Um , what other buttons were there ? Volume {disfmarker} oh we've ts just said that . user interface: So okay . marketing: Channel selection . user interface: This is just for T_V_ , it's not for {disfmarker} or it is {disfmarker} does need to be compatible with {disfmarker} project manager: Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: I {disfmarker} A D_V_D_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject , user interface: Yeah . project manager: You know actually our our new project requirements , I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things . user interface: So how do you switch {disfmarker} marketing: Menu . industrial designer: and menu maybe . Oh yeah . project manager: So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . So like if we had that {disfmarker} project manager: But we'll hold off on that 'cause {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: But s yeah uh . marketing: But D_V_D_ players usually have their own remote . user interface: That's true , yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: So , I know I'm not c really clear on what {disfmarker} industrial designer: But it's cool to have it all on one , because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch . user interface: Yeah , yeah . marketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager: Mm . Mm . user interface: So you'd have to have like {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: I think {disfmarker} you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can {disfmarker} you're either on T_V_ , you're on D_V_D_ or you're on V_C_R_ , or you're like . So {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Well but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons . user interface: Yeah , marketing: Yeah , it is only fun user interface: but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad . project manager: But i Yeah . industrial designer: Oh . But I think the circle only does {disfmarker} channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah but it {disfmarker} it would be {disfmarker} industrial designer: but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch . user interface: So {disfmarker} but I'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , so like you're {disfmarker} if you're on T_V_ , like you can switch channels , but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know , to different {disfmarker} I mean do we need to think about that , project manager: Um , yeah , let's think about it user interface: that like {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes we can try that . project manager: 'cause we need to wrap up . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound}
