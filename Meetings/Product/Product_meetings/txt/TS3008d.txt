project manager: Okay , welcome to the detailed design meeting . Again , I'm gonna take minutes . Oh , we're gonna have a prototype presentation first . user interface: {gap} project manager: Uh , who's gonna give the prototype presentation ? You two guys ? Okay . Go ahead . industrial designer: Yes . {vocalsound} {gap} user interface: {gap} . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound} user interface: {gap} coffee . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: 'Kay , we've made a prototype . Um , we've got uh {vocalsound} uh our aspects from the last meeting . Uh , especially we looked at the form , material and the colour . Um , we've uh drawn here the p prototype . The logo is uh is uh {vocalsound} is pretty uh {vocalsound} obvious to see on the on the remote control , user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: but it is necessary when you want to build your uh company f to a level higher . Um , {vocalsound} our interface elements , there are shown in the in the drawing . Maybe you can uh point them uh {disfmarker} The functions . user interface: Uh , well the uh {disfmarker} all the functions are discussed uh {disfmarker} I think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious . Uh , it's a little bit . Uh , power button . Uh then the the the nine uh channels . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Uh the volume uh uh at the side , and the other side is the programmes . And then we had uh just uh two buttons , we place them in the middle , uh the menu , and for the teletext project manager: Oh no , the the the mute button misses now . user interface: {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I thought that was th marketing: Alright , I {disfmarker} project manager: Do y do you {disfmarker} user interface: Oh , the mute button . project manager: did we want to have a m mute button ? industrial designer: But uh that {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: It's uh here then , in the middle . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Huh . marketing: Alright , and uh you gotta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button . industrial designer: Yes , um user interface: {vocalsound} Well , yeah mo uh mo industrial designer: we've disc user interface: Yeah , well most of them are right-handed . industrial designer: Most of the users marketing: Yeah , but you you gotta make it clear on the {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah well , I don't have time in uh anymore on the {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes , y there there will be a p a little a little P_ on that and a little uh {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: Yeah , and a and a triangle on that . user interface: Oh yeah , just progr programme above , I think . marketing: Yes . Next to that I kinda miss a zero actually . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Wait , there's {disfmarker} was one thing I wanted to ask . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh , there are different ways for remote controls to uh {vocalsound} do uh like marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: uh d I call it teens and twenties . Uh , y th th th the two numbers . industrial designer: Yes . marketing: All n no , that's um {vocalsound} kinda dependent on the television . user interface: Yeah , true , yeah . industrial designer: It's a television . Yes . project manager: Yeah , but do we have {disfmarker} do we need extra buttons , user interface: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} for example some uh some have to {disfmarker} user interface: Uh I think so . marketing: I think {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes , yes , you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it , uh th with the one and a double uh uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , I think you should add {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Zero ? marketing: A cross , or whatever . Yeah , line . project manager: Yeah , but you don't you don't actually need them , user interface: May maybe here ? industrial designer: yes . project manager: becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . And then a second . marketing: No , that's dependent on the television . project manager: No , I don't think so . industrial designer: Yes , you have televisions , then you have to , you know , you have to uh press {disfmarker} marketing: I do know so . user interface: Is it depending on television ? project manager: Nah , I don't think so really , marketing: Yeah . project manager: because you have a {disfmarker} I know some remote controls that don't have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty {disfmarker} uh a number in the twenty or in the ten . industrial designer: Yes , but but a lot {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yes , but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they come with the television . Or actually , the other way around . project manager: No , I think {disfmarker} uh I really think it's n marketing: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: because you can {disfmarker} when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash , it's the same thing as when you just push the one , marketing: Yeah . project manager: because it i it first gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply . industrial designer: Yes , but marketing: Yeah , well {disfmarker} but su {vocalsound} If {disfmarker} industrial designer: some televisions don't accept uh that that {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , because that's i it's for television . It's exact the same thing . industrial designer: No , no , but s marketing: No no no . So some television respond differently . Look , if uh i i project manager: No , listen listen . When you push the button , the remote control gives a signal . I in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it . marketing: Yes . Yes , that's true . project manager: The one with dash , that signal gi and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one . user interface: Yeah . True . marketing: No {disfmarker} project manager: I think it works that way , really . marketing: No , it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it , uh if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , but it's exact the same {gap} that w would appear when you put a separate button {disfmarker} push a separate button . industrial designer: Yes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons . project manager: Yeah , but you don't underst uh you don't understand my point . marketing: Yep . {vocalsound} True . project manager: I think it's exact the same thing when y industrial designer: You want {disfmarker} Yes , but some television don't support it . project manager: No , but then they would a would also support that button , because it's the same thing . user interface: But the ex project manager: Listen , with {disfmarker} that that's that special but button {gap} you're talking about , eh ? That's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv T_V_ that they have to put a one in {disfmarker} on your screen and a dash , which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it . When you don't have that separate button , and you push y one , it's exactly the same thing . Do y you {disfmarker} the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had {disfmarker} industrial designer: No , marketing: No , s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c industrial designer: a remote can {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes , project manager: But you give the input . industrial designer: so they need {disfmarker} no , they need {disfmarker} project manager: You push the one . That's the same thing as the button with the one and it {disfmarker} marketing: No , that's not true . project manager: yes it it is . marketing: It's simply not true . It's simply not true . project manager: Think about it . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: No , user interface: You uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash , and then wait uh two uh seconds or something {disfmarker} industrial designer: but uh {disfmarker} marketing: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: And it's the same thing what happens and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one . marketing: No , remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds . Remote control is a stupid thing . If you push a button , it sends it immediately to to the television . project manager: Yeah , that's true . Yeah , but I m uh but it's {disfmarker} I I know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that doesn't sport these buttons , it still works . industrial designer: Yeah , it {disfmarker} project manager: But okay , we we'll impl marketing: No , definitely not . Definitely not . user interface: We'll discuss them in the usability lab . project manager: No , we'll apply them then for now . user interface: Uh eva evaluation . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: I don't know uh I don't know if if it's it's necessary . project manager: Yeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two . user interface: Yeah ? project manager: Yeah , I think so . Yeah , for now , if we don't know for sure whether {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: And the button for the SCART uh audio video uh external input . marketing: Yes . user interface: Ach . project manager: Yeah but {disfmarker} marketing: Uh , you can access that uh via zero , and then minus , I guess . project manager: okay . {vocalsound} What I said about uh the remote control sending another signal , that that might not be true , marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: but I still think i it it {disfmarker} all T_V_s in some ways support it , I don't know . I think it's more c is m maybe we don't {disfmarker} uh we both don't really understand how it i how it really works , industrial designer: No , no . project manager: but I think there's more to in than wha than what you just said . industrial designer: Uh , remote control sends one signal at one button uh press . project manager: I do think that uh m T_V_s support mur multiple kind of remote controls . M industrial designer: Uh , some {disfmarker} N some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten {disfmarker} project manager: Th won't work wi with uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: No , you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals . project manager: to have that special button . industrial designer: When you uh press one button , you give one signal . And the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher . But {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , well we'll see . marketing: Yep . industrial designer: When you make the technology that that it will uh give more signals , it could work , but {disfmarker} Just a basic idea of of of the most uh {disfmarker} most y most common uh and simple uh operations on the remote . marketing: Okay . I kinda miss the docking station . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yes . It's here on the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Well it {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: yeah , uh there's nothing {disfmarker} I think it's pretty basic , industrial designer: We came uh {disfmarker} user interface: the the {disfmarker} there's no fu industrial designer: Yes . user interface: there's one there's one button , marketing: No nothing really trendy about it . user interface: that's wha there's there's there's one function and that's n the one button when you want to find it . industrial designer: But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell , marketing: The button . industrial designer: because Real {vocalsound} Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls . So maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh M_P_ three players or or uh marketing: Yep . industrial designer: uh hearing devices . marketing: I think that's very difficult , because of different shapes of uh uh devices . industrial designer: Yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put uh {disfmarker} when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it , when it's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same uh {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , of course . Mm-hmm . Well it it got it {disfmarker} it has got to fit into the shape , of course . industrial designer: Yes , but we can make {disfmarker} marketing: The technology and the voltage can be the same . That's uh that's true . But uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this , then they all fit . industrial designer: No , we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same . marketing: Yeah , that's true , but uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it . Just have to be big enough for the biggest {disfmarker} marketing: Yes , but uh I I g Shouldn't it fall then ? It {disfmarker} isn't going to fall down ? {vocalsound} That's a bit uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: No , when you make it large enough no it it will not . marketing: yeah , I think {disfmarker} industrial designer: But then it's a little bit {disfmarker} marketing: No , but if if {disfmarker} like this , I'll I'll point it out , if you got uh a a a base a base like this , industrial designer: But it's just an idea . marketing: I won't draw it really . If you got a base which is uh as big as this {disfmarker} industrial designer: But it's flat it's flat as as this , so we can p make all the products as flat as this . user interface: You can . But i i i it's backwards . marketing: Yeah sure , but if you got if you got a tiny player , it can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yes , but when you make uh uh a bit of big {gap} {disfmarker} user interface: But it's it's backwards . It's leaning . It's leaning backwards , I think , in the in the docking station . marketing: Yeah . Uh , wha what you could do if you uh {disfmarker} from the bottom {disfmarker} user interface: That's text . {vocalsound} marketing: oh , right , help . project manager: But {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh , you could make like a hole in it , you know , of uh {disfmarker} in in the {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes , little holer {disfmarker} littler {disfmarker} Uh , little products go deeper in it . marketing: Yeah . That i that is possible , yep . project manager: Well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later , because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway , because we have some uh cost issues {vocalsound} still to come . marketing: Yeah , sure , you're right . industrial designer: Yes . And uh uh marketing: Oh . project manager: But we have to look n I don't know . industrial designer: the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control , because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area . marketing: I don't like the colours . Mm-hmm . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Then your uh left thumb of uh {disfmarker} your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button , which is the most common used uh function , and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: So it's it's it's really good design . marketing: Yeah . Alright . project manager: Yes . That's it ? industrial designer: Yes , uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber , and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material , a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it . marketing: The light . Okay . And other lights ? project manager: I think added lights are gonna be a problem too . industrial designer: Yes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make uh light on it . marketing: No , o on the on the front . Yeah , okay . Maybe the uh the logo . industrial designer: Yes . user interface: {gap} lights ? industrial designer: But , it will also uh uh use batteries , marketing: Yeah , why not ? industrial designer: and do we want to {disfmarker} marketing: Of course . project manager: Okay . For now , uh this is uh is good enough . user interface: Mm . project manager: Yeah , what was uh on the {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . industrial designer: The {disfmarker} all the aspects of the interface buttons were uh {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , but in the {disfmarker} oh yeah , the colour , because we're gonna use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber , isn't it ? Then we're gonna do the buttons in the i are we're gonna have rubber buttons . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: And they're be a {disfmarker} {gap} they'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes . marketing: Uh , in the same colour as the side . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . marketing: Yeah , I think I think that'll be good . project manager: Okay . And I think we should use a a darker colour for the um plastic , and maybe some more m brighter and flashy stuff {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes , maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh uh multiple uh lights , marketing: Yes . industrial designer: so it will uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , we'll talk about the lights later . 'Cause I also don yeah , industrial designer: Yes . marketing: Yep . project manager: it's depends on the costs and such . But uh , and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours , marketing: Yeah . project manager: but may I dunno if that's important , but we'll talk about that later . Okay , for now this is this is okay . marketing: We will . project manager: Um , the next p y you gonna give a presentation too ? Uh , I have to see the agenda . industrial designer: No . marketing: Well , uh yeah , I I'm gonna do something right there , yeah . industrial designer: {gap} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Detail design . marketing: We gotta do that on the right {vocalsound} {disfmarker} the most {disfmarker} right-most screen , because the leftmost {disfmarker} project manager: Evaluation criteria . marketing: Yep , that's me . project manager: Okay . user interface: Okay . marketing: Alright . I will be needing that image , so leave it please . Um {disfmarker} Go away . Right , we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points . {vocalsound} Um , we g the four of us are going to do that um together . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: I wanna have a colour over here , come on . Right , the remote {vocalsound} is not ugly , a bit weird sentence , but the positive things has to be on the left , so I {vocalsound} said not ugly instead of ugly . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh , what would you say , we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design , and please forget the drawing skills of these guys . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} The remote control is not ugly . How do you feel ? project manager: Yeah , I think four maybe would be appropriate , because it's {disfmarker} Yeah , maybe it really depends on taste . Uh , I mean it's kind of {gap} , our design . It's {disfmarker} marketing: Yes . project manager: so if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly , you know , o other people find it really cool . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Background colour . project manager: I don't know or uh I don't know how you {disfmarker} Casting . Yeah . industrial designer: I think I think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side , because you can uh make it in your own {disfmarker} marketing: How do you guys feel ? The different designs . industrial designer: yes , you can make it in your own uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yes . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: more to your own personality or or house style . marketing: Okay . project manager: Yeah , but we d we didn't {disfmarker} we're we're not planning to use fronts , I believe . marketing: No , not not fronts , but different designs . project manager: With a colour a co a colours . Oh , okay . user interface: No , not fronts . Different designs . Different colours maybe , yeah . industrial designer: Yes . marketing: And that's still uh uh , yeah , is is uh is a little personal touch , I guess . project manager: Okay , but {disfmarker} Oh , maybe we should do three or something that w you know , our {disfmarker} marketing: What ? Yeah , wha wha what would you uh guys uh think ? Personally . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Or forty . {vocalsound} user interface: We can make it a one . marketing: Personally . Yes , but what is it ? industrial designer: I think two or three . user interface: Mm yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Guido ? user interface: I agree . marketing: Two or three . user interface: Um , I uh I go for the positive . So I go for two . marketing: I was {disfmarker} I was thinking about three , so I guess project manager: Uh , I was thinking about four , so I think three is uh {disfmarker} user interface: Okay , three . marketing: three is uh a bit uh {disfmarker} oh , what am I doing ? I'll mark it . The remote control's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah well , let that {disfmarker} let's make that a one . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yes . user interface: Two . One . One . marketing: Yeah ? industrial designer: Yes . marketing: Antek , you agree ? user interface: Okay yeah , I'll I'll agree . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: That's one thing for sure . marketing: Yeah . You're not Antek . user interface: I'm the I'm the usability , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: I totally agree . The remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible . industrial designer: Yes . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , two or a one , I guess . user interface: The {disfmarker} project manager: It's something we really put work into . marketing: Yeah , I {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: It's all about the buttons . marketing: I would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant . {vocalsound} And our {disfmarker} oh yeah , it's a b yeah . Yeah ? Alright . That's a one ? You agree ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: The remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . I think we totally succeeded there . project manager: But {disfmarker} user interface: Well {disfmarker} project manager: Well maybe a two , because of the menu button or something . marketing: Oh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , well menu {disfmarker} Yeah , maybe . marketing: Yeah , that's true . That's true . project manager: And telete industrial designer: Also , the the the buttons of the one , the two , the the digits , project manager: Yeah , we don't know if the {disfmarker} uh they're necessary . industrial designer: o they're used uh uh {disfmarker} marketing: {gap} the the {disfmarker} yeah , m well , you d you've got a point . project manager: I think a two . user interface: Yeah , true . Yeah , I agree . industrial designer: Can {disfmarker} yes , three , two . project manager: Came a long way , but not {disfmarker} we didn't not uh {disfmarker} marketing: Two or three ? user interface: Mm two . industrial designer: But you can't make a remote control without them , marketing: Two ? Antek . user interface: Because we got {disfmarker} industrial designer: because {disfmarker} marketing: Nay that that that's true , that's true . They're definitely needed . project manager: No , w w it can also always be more simplistic , but two is {disfmarker} marketing: So {disfmarker} we put it on a two ? project manager: yeah . industrial designer: Yes . marketing: The remote control has got a really trendy look . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yes . A one . project manager: Yeah , uh a t I think a two . marketing: Maarten . user interface: Well . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah yeah , y i it's hard to say from this picture . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: We {disfmarker} we've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Ever , yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Guido . project manager: But I do think it's more {disfmarker} user interface: Uh , I will I will make it a three , because uh {disfmarker} yeah . I I th project manager: But I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful . industrial designer: Yes . marketing: Yeah , uh I agree . I agree . project manager: {vocalsound} So so I think maybe it has to score higher uh on this than on the {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . True , yeah . marketing: I was planning to give it a two , uh where I give the not ugly uh {disfmarker} project manager: A th a three . marketing: oh , yeah , that's true . You agree on the two ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: I i uh when you compare to the {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes . marketing: Great . Remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . project manager: Uh uh what's the difference with {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh , I copied that one . Well , uh forget that . project manager: Okay . marketing: Um {disfmarker} Go away . Remote control has got innovative technology implanted . user interface: No . We're not {disfmarker} project manager: No . industrial designer: No . user interface: well , maybe the the the {disfmarker} on the side . industrial designer: No , not L_C_D_ , so . project manager: Yeah , but we uh {disfmarker} {gap} you mean the rubber stuff ? marketing: Yeah , and the light . project manager: Yeah , but we have t we have to talk about the lights uh . user interface: And the light maybe . industrial designer: But that that's not innovative . user interface: But {disfmarker} project manager: And I don't u also it's also really not innovative , industrial designer: Lights lights are {disfmarker} marketing: Well , I g project manager: it's more {disfmarker} marketing: It's not {disfmarker} seven ? project manager: No , six . Or seven maybe , {vocalsound} yeah . user interface: Well , six . No , six . project manager: Or six . industrial designer: Six . marketing: Why uh why not a seven ? user interface: Six . project manager: Yeah , mine is seven . industrial designer: Because we've tried to make it a little bit innovative , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: but it but it {disfmarker} project manager: Uh it's uh depends on the on the maybe {disfmarker} marketing: How ? industrial designer: With the lights it {disfmarker} it's it's kind of future {disfmarker} user interface: {gap} {disfmarker} project manager: No , I think I think actually it's a seven maybe , but there's nothing innovative about it . marketing: Yeah , you think the lights are innovative ? Well , it's n true . Uh , I agree , industrial designer: But still you can retrieve it when it's when it's gone , with the {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} marketing: m but {disfmarker} user interface: Innovative in generally or just f original for {disfmarker} marketing: I'll {disfmarker} Yeah , you you didn't draw the docking station . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yes . {vocalsound} The docking station is a is a little bit innovative . project manager: N no no , marketing: Yeah , it it's {disfmarker} I think I think with its {disfmarker} project manager: t {gap} . user interface: A docking station is innova project manager: Yeah , I mean the dock station , but but uh , I think the the docking station , {vocalsound} it's gonna be a {gap} kind of a problem . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: It's a part of the remote . marketing: I think more m user interface: Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} And with the speaker on the {disfmarker} there's also a speaker . project manager: But {disfmarker} marketing: Uh that {disfmarker} that's n project manager: Well , let's leave it open for uh for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway . Well I i {gap} yeah . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: No ? marketing: No uh , well , the agenda says evaluate now , so I think we {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , for now it's a six or a seven uh , sev marketing: It's it's a six . project manager: six maybe , user interface: Six . project manager: because {disfmarker} industrial designer: But the retrieval or the {disfmarker} marketing: That m f project manager: Yeah , but I don't I don't know if it's very {vocalsound} inno yeah . marketing: Yeah , for the retrieval function . Yeah . I think that's very innovative for a remote control . project manager: Yeah , v industrial designer: Yes , {gap} how would you innovate a remote control more ? project manager: Yeah , more through uh like function T_V_ functionalities and {disfmarker} industrial designer: To put it on your head . project manager: no no , you know what I mean . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: You have {disfmarker} {gap} must be innovative technology for remote controls , but more in how you control stuff , not in how you find your {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah sure , but {disfmarker} project manager: yeah . Yeah , it's {disfmarker} marketing: But I d I definitely don't think it's a five , project manager: that's that's {disfmarker} think about it la later on marketing: but {disfmarker} project manager: and uh {disfmarker} marketing: Remote control is easy to use . project manager: Yeah , as a a one or a two ma uh at least . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yes . user interface: Yeah , a two . industrial designer: Yes . marketing: I think a two . project manager: Yeah , it's good . marketing: Yeah ? user interface: More two . marketing: Come on . The remote control hasn't got uh {disfmarker} {gap} . project manager: No , I would have seen {vocalsound} that one before . Oh , you skipped one uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: I've just filled {disfmarker} uh project manager: Uh , here . marketing: Go away . industrial designer: You like the buttons . {vocalsound} marketing: I found twelve questions so much , but it still is ten . project manager: Remote control will be bought by {disfmarker} marketing: It will be bought by people under the age of forty . project manager: Yeah . Definitely . user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Well {disfmarker} industrial designer: In in {disfmarker} and comparing with uh people of th of the age above ? marketing: No no no . No , just if they if they buy it . project manager: Uh , just in general . Yeah , a two . industrial designer: We don't know . But {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , but I think I think two . marketing: Yeah , what do you think ? user interface: Yeah , I think two , yeah . I agree . Two . marketing: Antek ? industrial designer: Yes , two , but only in c when you compare it with with elderly . project manager: Uh , that is not the question . It's just w it will be bought by people under forty . marketing: No , that's no comparison . project manager: Yeah , you can {disfmarker} yeah , you can be very picky about it . marketing: And I don't mean two people . industrial designer: This is just guessing . project manager: Ah yeah , just make it {disfmarker} we'll make it a two . industrial designer: Make it a two . marketing: W w industrial designer: When it succeeds , uh it can get a two , mu marketing: Right , the rem The remote control has recognisable corporate image , colour , logo or slogan . project manager: Oh no . Yeah . Yeah , you have make an user interface: We don't have the slogan though . project manager: {disfmarker} slogan is quite obvious {gap} . marketing: Oh , the slogan . project manager: Oh the {disfmarker} oh sorry , no , not not the slogan . marketing: Can we see the slogan ? project manager: Yeah , you can put that on the side if {vocalsound} if we would like to . user interface: The logo . industrial designer: A logo . user interface: Underneath it or something . industrial designer: Yes , uh encrypted uh with {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , and I will I th still think it's gonna be a two or a three . marketing: Are we gonna do that ? user interface: {vocalsound} A three . Three . project manager: Maybe a three this time . user interface: Yeah , a three . industrial designer: Yes . marketing: Three ? I agree . Because of the slogan {gap} {disfmarker} project manager: And uh {disfmarker} marketing: Remote control's got a basic design intended uh for novice users . project manager: Uh , it's a one or a two . user interface: Yeah , two . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Yeah , make it a two . user interface: Two . marketing: Two ? Two . Alright . We gotta add up the scores now to see our total average . Four , five , seven , nine . Forget that . Fifteen , seventeen , twenty one , twenty four , twenty six . Twenty six . It's a two point six . project manager: It's not that bad . marketing: Alright , we {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , and that's mostly the inno marketing: yeah . project manager: when we uh score higher on innovative technology , we would score two , marketing: Yeah . True . project manager: which is uh quite a great score . Okay . Uh , this is {disfmarker} was uh the evaluation ? marketing: {vocalsound} This was my evaluation . So {disfmarker} project manager: Because I I still think that the most important part of this meeting still has {disfmarker} marketing: We did a pretty nice job until now . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Um , is this your {disfmarker} industrial designer: Is there something after this uh meeting ? Or {disfmarker} marketing: Whatever . Well , I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire . user interface: No . Okay , yeah . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Still opened or uh {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay , finance . Because um user interface: {vocalsound} Shoot . project manager: I received uh a spreadsheet . marketing: A five . A five . project manager: Yeah , but I uh actually don't need this presentation , I guess . Oh . marketing: Doesn't matter . project manager: I'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together , because I didn't really fin uh I have a {gap} . user interface: {gap} project manager: Didn't really finish it . Well , we uh {disfmarker} We'll see . We'll stumble upon some problems . marketing: We probably will . project manager: {gap} I probably have already opened it here . {gap} try it again . First of all , the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list . But let's let's st start with beginning . We include one battery . I i uh I'll explain its {disfmarker} Uh , the the components are listed over here . Uh , price is given . We um {disfmarker} yeah , marketing: The amount , yeah . project manager: we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them . And then uh , we'll uh calcula Don't watch the number yet . I don't know if it's filled in properly . Okay , we need one battery . One battery . I think one battery is enough . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: We don't need kinetic , solar cells , hand dynamo . A s okay , this this is a p first problem . Uh , I think we should know how many simple chips , regular chips {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh it's it's one one chip , but but you have to choose one from it . project manager: Okay . But {gap} {disfmarker} industrial designer: The simple chip is e enough I I think , but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval , it can be uh {disfmarker} marketing: I don't know {disfmarker} project manager: Where did we find this information ? Was it {disfmarker} marketing: I haven't got an idea on on which we need to use , really . project manager: I think it was uh your job in the first uh meet Uh , f your first presentation to make this clear , but then you had some t time problems . user interface: No . industrial designer: No , uh I {disfmarker} Yes , my my my uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: The the email I got said uh simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device , it will uh cost a a bit more , like I think the advanced chip {disfmarker} maybe . marketing: Yeah . And how do you know ? I mean , you got that email . Did it point out what to use them for ? industrial designer: Bec No , the {disfmarker} they didn't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it . project manager: Maybe you can uh look it up right now . Okay , but {disfmarker} okay . When we don't {disfmarker} when we leave the uh retriever and such aside , what {gap} {disfmarker} industrial designer: Then it's a simple chip . project manager: then it would be a simple chip . And with the retriever , it would be an advanced chip . industrial designer: Yes , I I I s I {disfmarker} marketing: Alright , well , point out the advanced chip for now , I guess . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: That will be enough for future uh recommendations . project manager: Yeah , but it will it will it will be {disfmarker} cause a lot of problems . {vocalsound} The sample sensor {disfmarker} sample speaker . What is it m is that the speaker we were t I don't know what it is . industrial designer: I don't know it uh either . marketing: I don't know . project manager: Okay , we went for the double-curved case industrial designer: Yes . project manager: made out of plastic and rubber . And with a special colour . I guess that's what we were {disfmarker} user interface: Well , special colour . {gap} . project manager: Yeah , I don't know about the special colour , but I think w uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Otherwise , you get uh a standard uh plastic colour . user interface: I don't {disfmarker} marketing: I don't know if it's very special . project manager: Yeah , I think we uh we have special colours . user interface: Mm okay . industrial designer: Standard rubber . marketing: Alright , that's okay . project manager: Okay , then the push-button , I was just counting them . industrial designer: St {vocalsound} project manager: Uh , I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use , isn't it ? user interface: Whoa , it's a little {disfmarker} project manager: Well that's bit of a problem , industrial designer: Yes . project manager: because I re but I really don't understand that , because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons , and it wouldn't be possible according to this uh sheet . user interface: {vocalsound} That's huge . No . We have {vocalsound} the simplest buttons . marketing: No . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: No , it's only uh when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much . marketing: I don't think so , because it says amount . industrial designer: If you use a scroll-wheel {disfmarker} project manager: Ah . Yeah , it wouldn't {disfmarker} marketing: The the the yellow row is the amount of {disfmarker} project manager: Fill in the number of components you plan to use in the {gap} and the total cost {disfmarker} I don't know . I industrial designer: Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons . You can have f four kind of push-buttons . user interface: Uh , one til nine . industrial designer: Rubber . user interface: Is that one or is that nine buttons ? industrial designer: You can have uh {disfmarker} project manager: And I count them like this . One two three uh four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Because {disfmarker} Oh , this is {disfmarker} oh , this is one , okay . Twelve , okay , then it would be eighteen , because uh , I uh rated them as uh um as uh uh uh separate buttons . marketing: To n industrial designer: Different , marketing: that's total of four buttons . project manager: Yes . industrial designer: yes . project manager: And plus these two , f uh plus the mute button , and it's will be uh eighteen . marketing: I think that {disfmarker} Eighteen . One two three four five , si industrial designer: Why is that so uh expensive . project manager: Yeah , I don't understand . Y I do I don't get the point , because it's would be s relatively so expensive , just these m small buttons . user interface: Is it cents , the the the fifty cents a button ? marketing: Fifty cents for one single stupid button . user interface: No way . industrial designer: So , whe when you {disfmarker} so then it {disfmarker} project manager: Well , okay , well well let's make it just one . industrial designer: It's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of {disfmarker} project manager: Here , now it's now it's already s marketing: Yeah , exactly . Yeah . project manager: shall we just give our own interpretation to , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: because else we would really have a problem . It would be impossible to make it {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} I can't {disfmarker} user interface: It's way {disfmarker} marketing: I I I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button . Really . industrial designer: When you have the same amount of button , you have to put in wi in your carton . Board . project manager: And and less buttons than this isn't possible . industrial designer: And then throw it {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , yeah , {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: This is the most simple {disfmarker} user interface: No , no no . project manager: yeah , it is possible , but I've never seen one before . industrial designer: But whe project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah , only with uh page up , page down and volume , project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: No , really . project manager: Yeah , without the numbers . That's possible . Yeah , we could skip the numbers . user interface: Yeah , uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: but but {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , but I d I wouldn't want to own that . Really . user interface: That's still four . industrial designer: Uh , it's it's still for little children . They can handle that remote control , marketing: Yeah . project manager: Then uh , teletext would also be im impossible . industrial designer: but but it isn't fo Yes , it's for {disfmarker} it's li uh it's just for a little {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , that's no option , that's no option . project manager: Okay , we'll we'll just {disfmarker} okay . But then still , {vocalsound} when we {disfmarker} there's no room for a docking station or something . Tha w Le let's see th we have uh {disfmarker} oh yeah , button supplements . We'll give the buttons special colour . We'll give them a special form . Uh , I think we should mark the special form thing , because it {disfmarker} this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , I guess . user interface: {vocalsound} A special colour , why a special colour ? project manager: Because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings . user interface: But wha what s what special ? project manager: I think that's the {disfmarker} what they mean by a special colour . user interface: Okay , yeah . industrial designer: Otherwise , it {disfmarker} user interface: Uh , yeah . industrial designer: Otherwise it would be the {disfmarker} marketing: I don't think the special form is really true . project manager: I think all the special colour things have to be marked over here , because that's what we were planning to do , making it {disfmarker} industrial designer: Special form also , it says . project manager: Yeah , special material r also , marketing: Is it ? project manager: because i has rubber . And the buttons have to be rubber . industrial designer: What is the normal material ? user interface: Plastic . marketing: Yeah , I dunno . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Sh yeah . user interface: Plastic , I think . industrial designer: Classic ? user interface: Plastic . industrial designer: Oh , plastic . marketing: Plastic . project manager: 'Kay , but the problem now is that {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} There's no such thing as a docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} But we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station {disfmarker} project manager: Separately . user interface: Se no no no . industrial designer: yes . And and {disfmarker} but we don't have to tell it , but what we can say of {disfmarker} can um almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah . Yeah , but I do like the idea , but we {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: It uh {disfmarker} but it {disfmarker} then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore , but we can {disfmarker} marketing: No . industrial designer: No , but you {disfmarker} otherwise you can't retrieve it . project manager: but then you still have to use {disfmarker} we have to find out what chip we u need . marketing: Yeah , I really don't get it . I mean if it's a simple chip , then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents . project manager: I think we can agree on this . I I think the special colour thing has to be uh marked . 'Cause I think we uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , yep . project manager: Yeah , I think that's what what what they uh mean {disfmarker} industrial designer: But for two Euros and thirty cents , we uh we don't get a docking station . marketing: I think so , too . Oh , I don't know . project manager: But can we find out uh about uh this chips ? Because when we don't need a d a docking station , then probably we also have only {disfmarker} we also need a simple chip . user interface: And then we can get a docking station . {vocalsound} project manager: And maybe then we can do something extra . Oh , n uh oh , still {disfmarker} industrial designer: For {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: oh , it's gonna get more expensive with {gap} . Two . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Then we have some money left . We can put then {disfmarker} industrial designer: For two Euros . project manager: We can put a scroll-wheel on it or something . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Uh why ? project manager: Yeah , well who knows . Or a little bit of tin titanium . marketing: I mean i i if you {disfmarker} if it would cost two Euros , that had a total a total thing , it would be nice too , I mean uh we're not gonna add uh a trip to Hawaii to it . user interface: But what what can we do {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , or we can ki do the kinetic cells . That's also maybe an idea . user interface: But uh what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ? project manager: Yeah that's what then what he has to find out . Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now , then we know {disfmarker} then we exactly know what it will cost us . user interface: If if i project manager: Maybe is that {disfmarker} that's nice to know . user interface: Regular chip and {disfmarker} because we don't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip , for example . project manager: Yeah , bu bu but when we {disfmarker} yeah , but when we skip when we um {disfmarker} when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station , then we still {disfmarker} yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special , marketing: I like the hand dynamo part . project manager: because that was our our special feature . marketing: We can make a plain docking station for two Euros . user interface: Yeah . We'll go back uh tomorrow . {vocalsound} marketing: I mean {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , okay , you can also do that , but maybe {disfmarker} marketing: Wi wi without recharge {disfmarker} project manager: It still is a special remote control cons uh you know , wi its form is special and material . marketing: Yeah , but but we can make a docking station for two Euros uh if you don't put the recharge function in it . I mean , it has a shape . project manager: Yeah , but for two Euros , then we have still {disfmarker} maybe we have to use the advanced chip , marketing: Of course it has a shape , but i i project manager: then two Euros isn't even possible . marketing: Why should that not be possible ? project manager: Yeah , then {disfmarker} because then we'd {disfmarker} thirty cents left . marketing: No , for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip . project manager: Yeah , but {disfmarker} yeah , I don't know , because maybe d uh yeah , we have to find out with the simple chip . user interface: That's the question . If we do i do we need an advanced chip , or is it okay f project manager: Yeah , and w and and we uh need f marketing: Yes . industrial designer: It isn't in my information , so I don't know it uh either . project manager: and what is this ? Sample sensor sample speaker . industrial designer: It isn't in my information , I uh I {disfmarker} I've got a schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about uh advanced chips or {disfmarker} project manager: {gap} {disfmarker} You can look at it for s presentation . S technical functions ? user interface: No . industrial designer: Uh I've got here in uh {disfmarker} user interface: No no , they were uh mine , yeah . project manager: Oh . industrial designer: I will put a I will put a page on it . When my mouse works again . project manager: Oh , oh oh . Hey . Oh . industrial designer: My mouse is uh {disfmarker} marketing: Dead . industrial designer: Yes . marketing: Reanimate it . user interface: Died . industrial designer: Oh . Ah , I've got it . I will put uh my email on the the network . marketing: What the hell are these ? industrial designer: It's on it . marketing: Oh , whatever . user interface: Yeah , it's open . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Mm . I don't think here {disfmarker} it's in here already . user interface: It's circuit board . It's only just basics for for {disfmarker} project manager: It's nothing about s yeah . user interface: At the end circuit there is an infrared LED . industrial designer: Yes . marketing: This isn't helpful . project manager: No . But i in the presentation of yours , there was also something about different components . Which one was it ? user interface: Components design . project manager: Functional requirements ? industrial designer: Um {disfmarker} marketing: No , that was my presentation . user interface: Components design maybe . N on top . industrial designer: Yes , that was mine . project manager: Ah . Ah yes , it was the second one . industrial designer: But that was my second {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , it was your second {disfmarker} marketing: It's already open . project manager: your first presentation . marketing: It's at the bottom . project manager: Sorry ? user interface: Working design . marketing: It's uh at your task bar . user interface: Yeah , but it's the the other one . marketing: Oh . industrial designer: Mm {disfmarker} project manager: Uh , this is n this is not this n user interface: Was it working design or components design ? marketing: Sorry . project manager: that's not the right one . I don't {disfmarker} oh . marketing: Okay , sorry . project manager: No , this is the other one . Or maybe something is uh {disfmarker} maybe there's something abo in in these {disfmarker} user interface: Chip set . industrial designer: But this is the same uh {disfmarker} This is o only the possibilities . project manager: Here . industrial designer: Yeah . We can use a simple , a regular , or advanced chip . marketing: Yeah , nice . I it doesn't say anything . user interface: The display requires an advanced chip . project manager: You know that a push-button requires a simple chip , but a scroll-wheel , it it me requires {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} industrial designer: Ah , okay . project manager: Okay , so we only need a simple chip . user interface: Requires . industrial designer: With the light . user interface: Little lights . Yeah , but that that's just the same as the the LED . project manager: No no , that's just a simple chip . A scroll-wheel {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} marketing: That's not needed . project manager: it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip . So , we don't need any of them . marketing: A display uh is , of course , uh for showing letters . For showing text . industrial designer: L_C_D_ . user interface: Yeah . marketing: I don't think that uh just a l a little light {disfmarker} user interface: No . I think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay . marketing: Yeah , I agree . project manager: And what's the sample sensor slash sample speaker ? industrial designer: Maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up , page down . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , I guess so too . user interface: Yeah , true . Well , that's not too {disfmarker} what we want . marketing: Next channel . No . Well , we might want it , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} All in twelve Euros . project manager: Back to the costs . industrial designer: Twelve Euros and fifty cents . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So we're gonna use the simple chip . user interface: So , simple chip is okay . marketing: Great . Delete . industrial designer: And the lights . Where uh are the lights ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , lights , yeah , there's no marketing: Well , there're three , I guess . user interface: category . {vocalsound} project manager: Nah , there is some money left to be spent . user interface: Can we do it wi within two two Euro ? marketing: I think we can make a docking station . Yeah . project manager: Okay , but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control ? But I mean it isn't {disfmarker} it hasn't got any innovative technology , we aren't gonna apply any uh innovated {disfmarker} innovative te technology anyway , I think . I don't I don't see any possibility to do so , because it would {disfmarker} wouldn't fit our defi design philosophy . user interface: Mm-hmm . But it's original . project manager: But what w is there some extra {disfmarker} marketing: No , that's true . project manager: maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something . Instead of the rechargeable {disfmarker} the rechargeable thing was something to um {disfmarker} know , so y so people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore . marketing: M bu project manager: Maybe we {disfmarker} if we put the kinetic thing in it {disfmarker} industrial designer: But but sometimes you put a {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , you leave the p yeah , I know , but still I {disfmarker} they will think about that . I mean if you u industrial designer: Kinetics aren't uh nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking . project manager: The uh {disfmarker} it's made for s people {disfmarker} well , the they don't {disfmarker} if it was uh uh r useless technology , they wouldn't put it uh as a possibility . industrial designer: Uh solar cells are useless . project manager: And i it it {disfmarker} th th the the target marketing: Or the hand dynamo dynamo {disfmarker} project manager: the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking {gap} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Because I think it {disfmarker} when when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh uh power source , then it would be this one . Because it's one {disfmarker} it gets thrown around {gap} thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot {disfmarker} Hey that {disfmarker} maybe that's cool {disfmarker} that's a cool thing about it , you know . You don't use batteries . marketing: Yeah , but but if we ca project manager: I've never seen it before in a remote control . user interface: But then we could make a docking station . marketing: I don't know if {disfmarker} Five minutes . project manager: No , we we we can't make a docking station anyway . marketing: That's not true . project manager: Yeah , we can als or uh also m we we can make one {disfmarker} user interface: Wow , w why no li marketing: We can make a docking station for two thirty . project manager: we can still make {disfmarker} user interface: Look at now , we got two industrial designer: Fo {vocalsound} for a docking station . marketing: Two thirty . user interface: two thirty left . Ca can't we make a docking station of that ? marketing: We can make a docking station . Sure . industrial designer: With a cable , with uh buttons on it , with retrieval uh device in it . marketing: Sure . user interface: I don't know . marketing: The power device is is i i is very cheap . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: That's just a regular uh power cable and whatever . project manager: Yeah , but be serious , then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Wi with a button to user interface: Well , we we uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: wi with a button to retrieve it , so it will beep . marketing: So . industrial designer: Uh , so it's uh wireless technology . marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , but we uh we don't inc we haven't looked at the {disfmarker} these costs of the speaker and other stuff . I don't think it's realistic for you to do so . marketing: {vocalsound} Well then it's a useless project . industrial designer: Look at the case , project manager: Oh , because we {gap} {disfmarker} industrial designer: the case the case of of uh of uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , then we don't have any innovation things . project manager: We {disfmarker} well look at all the special stuff we have . Colour a the colours are special , the form is special . It {disfmarker} th this is whole concept . Uh maybe it {disfmarker} with the kinetic thing , I think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing . marketing: {vocalsound} Can't we uh {disfmarker} Can't we say fifteen Euros ? project manager: {vocalsound} Uh , no . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: No , sta yeah {gap} I mean {disfmarker} industrial designer: No , then we have to sell it for thirty Euros . marketing: No . user interface: No , we only make less profit of it . industrial designer: It's the {disfmarker} marketing: You can sell for twenty seven and a half . Then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs . user interface: {vocalsound} No . project manager: Yeah , I don my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing and make it uh like a {disfmarker} Uh uh I I I I still fee I also feel this concept of making it kinetic , because of the {disfmarker} you know , it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control . marketing: I don't think {disfmarker} industrial designer: Maybe we can uh can do it both . Maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote . Battery and kinetic . marketing: No . project manager: No , that wouldn't n no . marketing: Thirteen twenty . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , and it is also not a good {disfmarker} it's not {disfmarker} you have to really do it only kinetic , you don't want it to think about batteries anymore . marketing: And I think only {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes , but when it's {disfmarker} then when it {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , but only kinetic , then you gotta {disfmarker} project manager: No no . industrial designer: then you have to shake it uh and all when it's when it's empty . project manager: Yeah , it's great . marketing: You you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} No no no . No no , this is very sophisticated technology technology . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: When you use it {disfmarker} your remote like once a day , or maybe even less i i it {disfmarker} industrial designer: You asked for three d No , that's n that's not true . Uh , a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time . marketing: No . project manager: It {disfmarker} We can make it {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} no . Becau be but a remote control gets {disfmarker} why do they state that this technology can be used if it industrial designer: Yes , solar cells are also stated . project manager: Yeah , m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells . industrial designer: Why don't we use solar cells then ? project manager: Because I think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy , you know , with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing , and y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and {disfmarker} industrial designer: That's true . marketing: Yeah , it's funny for a week . I guess something like that , where you have to move it around very frequently , is demotivating . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , but you don't have to . Trust me . The idea of this technology is that you don't think about it , it just happens . marketing: No , I I don't move my uh my remote control very much , seriously . project manager: Okay , then we d Okay , well y we don't have to do it , but what {disfmarker} that would just have a lack of key features , you know . industrial designer: Oui . project manager: You m have to put something on your box . You have to make people buy it and uh {disfmarker} We can really can do the docking thing , uh it's not {disfmarker} yeah , uh we can do it , but it's would be a easy way out . industrial designer: {vocalsound} You can do it for fifty cents . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Well , we've got more than fifty Cents . project manager: Okay , but we have to grou to agree upon something , industrial designer: The c {vocalsound} The case the case alone is is is uh project manager: because uh we only have a minute left or so . industrial designer: the case alone for uh remote control is at least one Euro . Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station . project manager: No no , it's not possible .
