project manager: Help . {gap} It's up there ? That screen's black . marketing: {gap} industrial designer: {gap} project manager: Alright , okay . Okay , that's fine . marketing: {vocalsound} Oh God . project manager: Are we done ? Right , okay um , this is our second meeting and I might be a bit all over the place . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Um , right our agenda for today , do you want us to give you a second ? marketing: Uh , no that's okay , project manager: Okay , um {vocalsound} marketing: sorry . project manager: I'll go over what we decided last meeting , user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: um , we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , T_V_ , video equipment . user interface: Sorry . project manager: Um , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing . Um , our budget would have to affect um {disfmarker} try not to reflect our budget , um that we might have a bit of {disfmarker} oh oh you can see it , okay {vocalsound} . Um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Um want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . We discussed a flip-open design , um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming , things like that . Okay . Um , three presentations , I've got written here so shall we hear from Marketing first ? marketing: Um is it okay if I postpone that til later , I just want to get access to a little bit more information , project manager: No that's fine , that's fine . {gap} marketing: is that okay ? industrial designer: Okay , yeah I'll go first . Can I grab the {disfmarker} project manager: Unplug me . industrial designer: Thanks . What do I have to press ? Oh , F_ eight ? project manager: Um , F_N_ function F_ eight . industrial designer: Oh right , yeah . Okay . Maybe {disfmarker} user interface: Yep . industrial designer: Yep there we go . Okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: 'Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so . What {disfmarker} the first thing {disfmarker} question I asked was what are we trying to design ? Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that {disfmarker} well it wasn't really my area because {vocalsound} I'm dealing with the inside really . So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one {vocalsound} . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Um and uh {vocalsound} I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control . marketing: Mm-hmm . Could I {disfmarker} can I interject to ask a question there , project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah sure . marketing: is that appropriate ? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the {gap} surrounding it ? industrial designer: Um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries , marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in . marketing: Right , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ? industrial designer: Yeah the the {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . project manager: They are . industrial designer: well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption marketing: Oh I see . industrial designer: and how much you need to send the data across . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . {vocalsound} Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the {disfmarker} w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . And then I was uh {disfmarker} just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer . And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do . user interface: {gap} industrial designer: It's not a proper circuit , I'm not sure if it'd work or not , I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway , we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the {vocalsound} uh U_I_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would {disfmarker} the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to {vocalsound} whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and {disfmarker} reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment . And then finally , um we want uh the {disfmarker} it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good . Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of {disfmarker} d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa {vocalsound} thing that you could have , marketing: Mm . Mm . industrial designer: I {disfmarker} th that was just sort of a general point there . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} And that's uh {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: That's a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that , whenever you like me to present . industrial designer: Alright okay , and yeah , that's that's what I came up with there , project manager: Okay , thank you very much . industrial designer: so if you wanna {disfmarker} project manager: Um , would you like to continue on from that ? user interface: Yep . industrial designer: Ooh . user interface: 'Kay . It can be {disfmarker} project manager: Or , maybe move the laptop over . user interface: okay , that's okay with me . {gap} further . {gap} project manager: {gap} user interface: Oops . Why's it not working ? F_ eight , right ? project manager: F_ function . industrial designer: Function F_ eight yeah . user interface: Okay . Mm why's it in the right ? marketing: No . The plug hasn't come out at the bottom , has it ? No . user interface: Yeah , it's connecting {gap} . industrial designer: No , no yeah it's just {gap} . marketing: Meter adjusting . user interface: {gap} okay . project manager: Oh , there {gap} . user interface: Yeah . Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible . And to summarise I I would say it's {disfmarker} it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering {gap} maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will {gap} this two features together . So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you {disfmarker} you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . So it's like {disfmarker} it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh {disfmarker} added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not {disfmarker} of no use of punching in the uh {disfmarker} trying to put in those things in {disfmarker} on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? Yeah , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in {disfmarker} add in more features and make it less costly . Um , that's {disfmarker} so this is {disfmarker} if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use {disfmarker} usage and all that . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design . marketing: Mm . user interface: Uh any comments like , if you want ? project manager: 'Kay . Um , I think we'll chat about it at the end , user interface: Okay . project manager: okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah sure . marketing: 'Kay . project manager: Ooh , it's vibrating , that's strange . Oh , God . Right , okay . user interface: I think you'll have to {disfmarker} marketing: Have I got to keep this here ? user interface: You can't {disfmarker} marketing: Does it matter ? user interface: It'll have to {disfmarker} this can't be pulled . marketing: I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I ? project manager: We just do the best we can . marketing: Uh , whoops . user interface: You'll have to push it a bit more . marketing: Will it manage ? Bit more , user interface: Yep . marketing: oh dear . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah this is more than enough . Okay . industrial designer: There we go , I've got a bit more of the cable {vocalsound} . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Oh . {vocalsound} industrial designer: There we go . marketing: Is that okay ? user interface: Yeah I think you can pull it out now . marketing: Thank you , user interface: {gap} marketing: just pull it closer a little bit . industrial designer: Uh you should be able to {gap} and {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , you might . industrial designer: yeah , there you go . marketing: Get it right over , okay , thank you . project manager: Ah . Look at that . marketing: Okay , um , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . {vocalsound} Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . {vocalsound} Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here . The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , user interface: Yeah . marketing: so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . So again there's power implications there . {vocalsound} Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . Uh thirty four percent of people take {disfmarker} said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh {disfmarker} when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this . {vocalsound} I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you , user interface: 'Kay . marketing: but I think I'll just keep it simple , industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: if there's any more information I can email you extra details , user interface: {gap} That's fine . project manager: Okay . Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: is that okay ? project manager: Right , um industrial designer: Huh . project manager: we have new project requirements , um we're not going to be using teletext , user interface: Okay . project manager: um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . Um {vocalsound} our control is only going to be for T_V_ , it's not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it limits the cost for us , user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer . marketing: Mm-hmm , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ? project manager: It says for T_V_ only , so {vocalsound} looks like it's just {disfmarker} marketing: Just channel-hopping . project manager: yeah , I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but {vocalsound} I don't know , what do you think ? It just said , for T_V_ only . But I mean , general T_V_ controls do do video as well . marketing: Would that imply video use ? industrial designer: T yeah yeah . I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g project manager: I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you ? industrial designer: Yeah . If yeah {disfmarker} marketing: Mm-hmm , yes . industrial designer: and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so . project manager: Mm . I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and {vocalsound} programming . user interface: {vocalsound} Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ? marketing: Yes . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons , user interface: Ten perc project manager: Mm . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . project manager: Hmm . industrial designer: Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Pens industrial designer: and they're not that great anyway . marketing: In fact I've just called up that table there , industrial designer: Alright , okay . marketing: we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we didn't differentiate . Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen , that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ? industrial designer: Alright , okay . marketing: So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there , project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group , I think that's just general fear of new technology . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Yeah but um on on that again I just thought {disfmarker} 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: bu marketing: Oh yeah . industrial designer: so I thought that could be quite a {disfmarker} marketing: Right . project manager: We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing marketing: Mm . project manager: um because it is something I {disfmarker} it needs to be {disfmarker} the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling , industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: maybe {vocalsound} on the T_V_ {disfmarker} you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps user interface: Okay . project manager: and you're like oh okay it's over there , something like that , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yes . That's a super idea . project manager: but that's {disfmarker} that sounds a lot cheaper to me . industrial designer: Hmm . Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Um {vocalsound} the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . Um so we want logo , we want um fashionable , trendy , I mean what you were talking about with the marketing . Um , people paying more for it to look good . Um , we need to focus on that as well . marketing: Yes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty project manager: Yeah . marketing: and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno , project manager: Mm . marketing: you get the idea . It's it's gonna vary around the world . At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it's the user interface design that may {disfmarker} and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs {gap} ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: Sure . industrial designer: Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs user interface: Alright . industrial designer: I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same . user interface: Right . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: The features could be same and the body could look slightly different . industrial designer: Just {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: yeah , yeah . marketing: Mm . user interface: So {disfmarker} project manager: What about {disfmarker} you were talking about the buttons , user interface: Yeah . project manager: um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , I mean , 'cause we got to make it original , what about um you know with the touch screen computers industrial designer: 'Kay . Yeah , yeah that's what I was just {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: yeah ? Um so you {disfmarker} it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either , not sure about the {disfmarker} user interface: {gap} industrial designer: No , well no 'cause you wouldn't have to {disfmarker} you don't actually have to press them you just {disfmarker} project manager: You don't have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it . user interface: {gap} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Um , think that might appeal {disfmarker} I'm thinking kind of Japan , I'm thinking uh young , um office people , marketing: Mm . Mm-hmm . project manager: trendy kind of a thing . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def project manager: Um , but quite , um , easily labelled so that anyone can {gap} oh yeah that's obvious what that's for marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations , um {disfmarker} marketing: Mm-hmm , mm . industrial designer: Mm . But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs , ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um {vocalsound} if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big project manager: Were too big . industrial designer: because um {vocalsound} they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands project manager: Mm . industrial designer: so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh {disfmarker} so if you {disfmarker} I don't know what {disfmarker} 'cause you {disfmarker} obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others . user interface: Yeah , uh maybe to {disfmarker} as uh {disfmarker} it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: So , a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also , the market . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , yeah . project manager: I think we have to design one product industrial designer: Hmm . Huh . project manager: and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely . project manager: It's gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities , um . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . I'm concerned , when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that . Um , R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: I'm j I really can't get my head round this one , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about . industrial designer: I {disfmarker} yeah I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause {disfmarker} without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel marketing: Mm . I know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes I know . industrial designer: and it becomes {disfmarker} project manager: Or a speech recognition , industrial designer: yeah . Yeah , speech recognition , marketing: Yeah . project manager: which is extremely expensive , industrial designer: but {disfmarker} project manager: I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue . industrial designer: yeah . marketing: Yes . Mm-hmm . Do we have to initially um , you know looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . Do we really have to go for everyone right away ? Um . user interface: We could focus on the biggest market . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Mm . user interface: If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ? industrial designer: Ge uh {disfmarker} marketing: And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people . project manager: We are {disfmarker} we're talking about um the type of company that we're working for as well . That they want um it to be fashionable , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume {disfmarker} associate that with the older generations . marketing: Mm . project manager: Now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Mm-hmm {vocalsound} . project manager: but I don't think we're focusing on that , I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um , business kind of class type people . marketing: Mm . Mm . I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first {disfmarker} it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this . project manager: Okay , so the remote control functions . Um we've got the T_V_ , user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: we've got the video , now there's um I can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details , industrial designer: Video plus . project manager: yes . We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah yeah . project manager: I always found that really easy when I discovered it , um marketing: Mm . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: because you've got your general record anyway so if you {disfmarker} there's a programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to , you put the number in industrial designer: Just whack in the number . project manager: and it's just a number , it's not a date , it's not a time , it's not a channel , it's not when it finishes , it's not anything like that , industrial designer: And you w {vocalsound} project manager: it's just a number . industrial designer: yeah . And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that , project manager: No . industrial designer: you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway , project manager: You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway . industrial designer: yeah . marketing: Right , I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful {vocalsound} . project manager: It is industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: after um {disfmarker} if you look in the newspaper , T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards industrial designer: It's not {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth marketing: Ah , hmm . project manager: so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times , marketing: Right . project manager: um and it has been around for quite a long time . industrial designer: It's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things . project manager: No it's not um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that {disfmarker} marketing: Superb . Mm . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Yes . industrial designer: Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it {disfmarker} you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on project manager: Mm . marketing: Right . industrial designer: and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series . marketing: Excellent , mm-hmm . industrial designer: So that {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: But just to have that function would be would be really good . marketing: Right . project manager: Okay so {disfmarker} marketing: Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me , I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , {gap} to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: they'll phone the company , you can use their telephones . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it I press for this ? Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ? industrial designer: Mm . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um {disfmarker} the companies who uh who you deal with have actually {disfmarker} they've they've got an obligation to to help you out marketing: Mm . Mm-hmm . industrial designer: and also {disfmarker} I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having {disfmarker} marketing: Right . project manager: The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there , you're pressing this button and your T_V_'s not doing it . Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing , it's not working , what should I do ? marketing: Alright . {vocalsound} Yes user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel , industrial designer: {gap} marketing: but I mean for {disfmarker} if there were any more {disfmarker} or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video , project manager: I think so . industrial designer: Yeah , I mean {disfmarker} marketing: we're not gonna put any {disfmarker} {vocalsound} okay , just a thought . project manager: Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that . project manager: Instruction manuals . But I mean they're {disfmarker} there's customer service , marketing: Okay . project manager: there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to industrial designer: Yeah . Department , yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . Sure . project manager: and that way there's no call out charge , there's no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , um . marketing: Mm . user interface: Right . marketing: Yeah . user interface: I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to {disfmarker} for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that . industrial designer: And they're {disfmarker} marketing: Not for such simple functions industrial designer: yeah , they should be f yeah . marketing: because we're focusing on that , project manager: Mm . But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible marketing: yes okay . user interface: Simple . project manager: because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes . project manager: It does , industrial designer: It's the uh {disfmarker} project manager: you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong industrial designer: yeah . project manager: and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about . marketing: Sure , okay . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Um , what other functions ? We need {disfmarker} I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , but we should think about {disfmarker} c 'cause you've got the dilemma between {disfmarker} oh batteries , that's what I was thinking about . Mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ? industrial designer: Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but {disfmarker} project manager: Well they la they they last quite a long time , industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: and if you had uh {disfmarker} when you {disfmarker} th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Um , something like that should reduce the size of it . industrial designer: Yeah and if {disfmarker} yeah if you if you had if you had one of those {disfmarker} uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah it could be on that {disfmarker} yeah , okay . industrial designer: Yeah on that as well so . user interface: So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ? project manager: S industrial designer: Yeah project manager: Yes . industrial designer: some sort of docking station or {disfmarker} user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Rechargeable with a docking station . industrial designer: yeah . project manager: So the rechargeable which would be your field . industrial designer: Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time . user interface: Right . project manager: Yes , marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: which it is cheaper in the long run as well . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Um , th the shape you got trendy . I don't wanna big box with lots of things , you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either , marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many {disfmarker} {vocalsound} how much you try and make it simple , marketing: Mm . project manager: um {disfmarker} marketing: And we don't w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical , project manager: They do . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . We definitely {disfmarker} an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we don't want that . project manager: Okay so we've got a flip-screen . user interface: Okay . project manager: Um {disfmarker} user interface: What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back . Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box , like a chocolate . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: That's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: and you don't have to {disfmarker} you don't bend your thumb too much , so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat . marketing: Slightly curved , curved . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay . user interface: G uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like . So it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't marketing: Mm . project manager: 'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway . user interface: y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your {disfmarker} marketing: Mm . user interface: the way you h hold of {disfmarker} it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom , something like that . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay . user interface: I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth . project manager: Can you look into the company logo ? Um , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product . user interface: Current . project manager: I mean for example , if it was a C_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something , user interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . project manager: um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design , marketing: {gap} project manager: while also making it quite different from anything else that's there . user interface: We could look in at that but {disfmarker} Mm . What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells , marketing: I mean look at the mobile . user interface: logo could become as {disfmarker} you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model , rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like . project manager: Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different . marketing: I think that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that sounds a really attractive idea , user interface: A sea shell ? marketing: I've not come across anything like that before , if it kind of {disfmarker} yeah and that opens out into your flip-top . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think . I think it's a really nice idea user interface: Yeah we could look in at that . marketing: and plus you can get {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know even though we're using plastic , you can still {disfmarker} I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior . project manager: Or you could do um different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . You could have different kind of casings . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . Mm-hmm . Less chance of it being lost too , it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa project manager: Yeah . marketing: and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't {disfmarker} not gonna lose it so much {vocalsound} either . It's easier to {disfmarker} bit nice to handle . project manager: Mm . user interface: Yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are {disfmarker} whichever appeals the most like , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: that could be the most common design . project manager: Okay . marketing: Okay . user interface: But we can like think of five , six designs . project manager: Okay . Right , I think we have to round it up , um {disfmarker} marketing: Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything . project manager: Sure . marketing: So it's no teletext , it's only for T_V_ and by implication video , user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about Videoplus . project manager: That was um in cutting down the number {disfmarker} that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date {disfmarker} marketing: Right . Right . Right , so when they press for programming you {disfmarker} it comes up on the L_C_D_ , a reminder about using Videoplus ? So that they have a look at the guide and {disfmarker} Or was {disfmarker} is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just {disfmarker} that was an add-on feature ? project manager: {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that . marketing: Uh-huh . Right . Right , so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature ? project manager: Um it could be it c It {disfmarker} yes , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: it could be uh adv advertisement feature , um rather than design feature , marketing: Right . project manager: you know , drawing attention to that . And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual , 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful . marketing: Mm , and the rechargeable batteries . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Was there anything else there that we {disfmarker} in the new new project requirements ? project manager: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . {gap} project manager: We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it , um . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . That's not at the moment a requirement , it's something we're looking at , project manager: Yes . Yes . marketing: what preference {disfmarker} so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like . project manager: And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um . user interface: For detection , right . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} the instruction manual , I don't know if we deal with that , um . I think {disfmarker} user interface: Yep , project manager: Yep , user interface: I think {disfmarker} project manager: and different from what's out there . Yep , I think that's us . marketing: Okay . user interface: True . marketing: What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved ? project manager: I think you might get guidance , but um I th Instruction manuals , 'cause there tends to be a demonised thing , marketing: Okay . project manager: u um , they're {disfmarker} everyone's got like a big pile of them , but no one really uses them . marketing: Okay . project manager: Um . user interface: Oops . marketing: Whoops , questionnaire four . user interface: We should f project manager: Yes , right . Okay . user interface: I think it's time for us to get back to {disfmarker} marketing: 'Cause we're at lunchtime now I think . project manager: Right , okay . I think you can email me , if there's any more questions . Um and I'll be able to not answer them .
