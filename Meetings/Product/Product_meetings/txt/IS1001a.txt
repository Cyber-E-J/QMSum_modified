user interface: {gap} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} How do you wear this thing ? project manager: Hmm . Mm mm mm . {vocalsound} user interface: Not too many cables and stuff . marketing: {gap} user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Original . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Is recorded ? Okay ? Okay so welcome everyone . So we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control . So I will first start with a warm welcome opening {vocalsound} stuff , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be {disfmarker} you will have to fulfil to complete this process . So {disfmarker} user interface: Uh . Just one thing . Uh , you said twenty-five minutes , but I have something else to do uh , so gotta have another meeting uh soon , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: so maybe you could hurry up a bit {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} sorry ? user interface: It's true . I have another meeting so if you could uh {disfmarker} project manager: You have another meeting soon ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: So you have to be quick . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , for the lawnmower project . project manager: Okay . user interface: Okay . project manager: So the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: So uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points . First it will be the functional design . Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design . So the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil . And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing {vocalsound} and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point . So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board . user interface: {vocalsound} What an original idea . project manager: {vocalsound} Do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us ? {vocalsound} user interface: Orangutan . project manager: Okay {vocalsound} that's good . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: No no n project manager: {vocalsound} n n {gap} user interface: Can I give you the project manager: You should {disfmarker} user interface: {disfmarker} no ? But I don't have to say anything . When I'm drawing the orangutan . project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} If you want to react uh about this wonderful drawing uh {vocalsound} I'll let you uh comment . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: It's an abstract drawing of an orangutan . project manager: Okay it's an abstract drawing . user interface: Yes . project manager: I think it's nice and original . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} You should write y the name I think . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: I don't have a red colour . Usually orangutans have red hair so this is a very important but I don't have red pen , so {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} Yes . project manager: You want to draw something Christine ? {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay uh sorry . You have to imagine a little bit {vocalsound} um . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: This {disfmarker} project manager: Of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Sorry too {vocalsound} uh . user interface: Yes . I know . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Is this uh {disfmarker} user interface: Wha what is this strange beast ? marketing: Is it beautiful ? {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Is it a monster ? project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Do you know ? It's a cat . user interface: It's a cat ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Isn't it ? {vocalsound} user interface: I thought these things did not exist . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yes yes industrial designer: Me {vocalsound} marketing: is it {disfmarker} like that . user interface: Ah yeah {vocalsound} industrial designer: Ah yeah . Yeah . marketing: Is it better ? project manager: Ah okay it's pretty . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay it's your cat . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} It's my cat . user interface: Does have a name ? marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: The name is Caramel . user interface: Caramel . Ah-ha . industrial designer: Caramel . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . Olivier , do you want to {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} And you {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I think I'm too short for the cables . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Okay I go , but next time you'll do something I'm sure . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I'm a bit short on cable . user interface: Next time I concentrate . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . So what could I draw ? {vocalsound} Maybe I can draw like a very simplified cow . {vocalsound} I don't know if it looks like a cow {vocalsound} user interface: He looks like a bong . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Like a what ? {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . Sorry . No . industrial designer: Quite squarey . user interface: Scary ? project manager: {gap} {vocalsound} industrial designer: He also . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: I dunno it it looks more like a donkey in fact {vocalsound} I would say . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} I I think we will be finished this uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm . project manager: Okay so I hope that it helps you uh in the process of designing a remote control . user interface: Is it for uh for putting a {disfmarker} for logos , no . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} That's {disfmarker} project manager: Let's move on . So {disfmarker} Here the uh financial objective of our project . That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million Euros . user interface: I is there a matter for a new remote control ? project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah if it's trendy , original I d fulfil the user needs . user interface: Is it uh a single device remote control or is it a multi-device remote control ? project manager: We have to discuss that point . user interface: Ah project manager: On {disfmarker} user interface: this is not defined at all ? project manager: yeah you you can suggest points like this . So what what {disfmarker} user interface: Ah , okay . project manager: so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple . So what's {disfmarker} what are your ideas about that ? user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Maybe I can have the {disfmarker} your opinion from the marketing side ? user interface: Well uh do we sell other stuff ? Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us . project manager: Okay , so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device . user interface: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Do you agree ? industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yeah . So maybe it should be for multiple devices . And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} I think we shouldn't have too many b for my part . I think {disfmarker} user interface: No , I couldn I cannot fi think of any requirements right now . {vocalsound} industrial designer: If we don't have so many buttons could be nice . project manager: {vocalsound} Few buttons . Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: And do you have it also to be {disfmarker} to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ? Might be a good idea . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Okay . And do you have any um any uh idea of the trend {disfmarker} the trend in domain , what it shouldn't {disfmarker} it should look like , or things like that ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Something which is not squarey maybe uh , not a box . user interface: Mm . project manager: With rou okay . Like for {disfmarker} okay . user interface: Something like that , least fits in your hand . project manager: Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: The basic requirement . project manager: So . Fit in your hand , yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} Only a buck . project manager: And also it have , i it may be {vocalsound} it may be important for the remote control to be uh {disfmarker} To , to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: Waterproof . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Water-proof as well . industrial designer: {vocalsound} And I think we should have a device {disfmarker} project manager: Maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh {disfmarker} in your bath whereas the others can't . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Maybe water-proof would be very original . industrial designer: Sorry . {gap} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Havin having a water-proof remote control so that the people can uh use it in their bath . user interface: Mm . project manager: That could be uh {disfmarker} user interface: B it seems uh so , but uh if you don't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f project manager: Yeah but , it is still something uh you have to buy and that is um not maybe very {disfmarker} user interface: And , and that's one of the {disfmarker} that's one of the shock {disfmarker} I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it . project manager: Yeah , mayb B user interface: That's people {gap} they actually do it themselves . project manager: But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well . industrial designer: Yeah . {gap} directly . user interface: I it will look a bulky in that case . project manager: Yeah . Maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: That might be good uh track to follow . user interface: Like as an optional thing . project manager: Optional or selled with it ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} And I I think we should have something , most of the time I I lose my remote control . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping . project manager: Maybe we can have uh {disfmarker} But we don't design the T_V_ . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep . industrial designer: Ah yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Barks . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , barks , yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Barks . project manager: So we can uh have a whistle uh remote control ? industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah whistle . project manager: I don't know , whistle-able ? {vocalsound} Th industrial designer: Whistle tracking . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Whistle tracking yeah . Whistle tracking remote control . That's a good idea , that's very original and that's can uh improve . user interface: {vocalsound} That's that's quite cool , but uh of course we {disfmarker} you don't normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right ? project manager: Yeah d d uh . user interface: So i it's just going to add t to the cost . project manager: Yeah but s still we have to mm we have to {vocalsound} have an advantage over our competitors . I think this is a good advantage . user interface: {vocalsound} It's cool . I think I like the idea , but I'm not sure about the what you , project manager: Yeah . We have to ask {disfmarker} user interface: who is giving {disfmarker} who's giving who's giving our budget . Who's {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} yeah {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Which is you . user interface: 'Kay . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Okay so try to find that for next meeting . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . So next meeting is in thirty minutes or so uh . {vocalsound} Don't pani . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Don't panic . {vocalsound} project manager: So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working {disfmarker} any working function we have discussed . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: And also um {vocalsound} I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user . So . And then uh I will uh just ask you to think about that and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon . {vocalsound} user interface: Mm . project manager: So . Thank you I think that's all for this point . user interface: Good . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Thank you {vocalsound} user interface: Uh , so we come back in five minutes ? Half an hour . project manager: Anyway you will receive some messages . {vocalsound} Be careful . You eat it ? Does it move uh ? Okay , but I don't know if it uh is still correctly uh {disfmarker} We'll see . industrial designer: Ah . {gap}
