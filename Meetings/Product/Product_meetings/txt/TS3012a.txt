Okay . marketing: Hmm . project manager: Oh , let's kick it off . Oh , there we go . So , our new project is about {disfmarker} we need design a remote control for television set , so , which has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . I took this off our corporate website . {disfmarker} I think well it sums up what we need to do . It's We're inspired by latest fashion , not only electronics , but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design . That's why our product will always fit in your home . So apparently we need to {vocalsound} um be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market . So that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want . marketing: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: So {disfmarker} So we put the fashion in electronics . So that's what we need to go for . Anyway , we'll take this project in three steps , three pha uh three phase of design . First step will be the functional design . marketing: Yeah . project manager: And that's basically what we're gonna do . Everybody has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards , so we can share information about {disfmarker} So I'm gonna keep this short , since we had a technical problem . So skip through this . Uh . Okay . Every meeting we {disfmarker} everybody can present their uh their views and everything , so to help with these , you have {disfmarker} we have the SMARTboards here . We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation . I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board , so it's {disfmarker} actually it's very easy . Like it says , very simple , you just take out the pen . Like you see here , I'll just take the {disfmarker} take {gap} here . That's it , you just put it on the board . You see a pen here . You go here , just like using a pen . You can just draw whatever you want . It's like the eraser , can erase whatever you want . And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views , if you wanna change the format , you just {vocalsound} either take out jus just like the pen , and whatever you want , your current colour , your line width , just to make the line bigger . So it should be really easy . marketing: Okay . project manager: This is to take the {disfmarker} just take a new slide and back again . We're just gonna keep using this board all the time , so I think it will be {disfmarker} it's very clear for everyone , I suppose . So I'll take this out . {vocalsound} Okay . We'll use that later . Anyway . Yeah , just just just stuff that you wanna share , just put it in the in the project folder , like I put my presentation now . I'll put the the minutes of every meeting , I'll put them there too , so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever . So next , been here . {vocalsound} Well , {gap} gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot . So basic idea is we have a blank sheet . Just try whatever you want , and like it says , draw your favourite animal . I think the creative genius should go first . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} The creative genius ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Thank you very much . project manager: So , draw us your favourite animal . user interface: {vocalsound} Well , I'm more into the technical aspects of drawing , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: so I'm not really good at drawing animals , project manager: Draw us a technical animal . user interface: but uh the animal which I {gap} {disfmarker} Oh . project manager: Yeah , it's still erasing . user interface: {vocalsound} Pen . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Uh format . Else my animal will be like king-size . I pretty much like {vocalsound} a dolphin , because of its uh its freedom basically . Let's see . A head . {gap} actually worked with this . It's like uh it's a very {disfmarker} Uh high-tech . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Bit low-responsive though . project manager: {vocalsound} So that's what we don't want . user interface: Prefer pen and paper . project manager: We want a high-responsive product . So {disfmarker} It looks more like nuclear bomb . marketing: {vocalsound} Very nice dolphin . user interface: It {vocalsound} {vocalsound} doesn't look like a nuclear bomb . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: This thing isn't doing what I'm {disfmarker} What I want . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Let's go easy on it . user interface: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , well it does look like a nuclear bomb . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: I'll just finish up real soon , because I'm {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: So it doesn't really look like a dolphin , project manager: {vocalsound} Anyway , user interface: but then again , this is all new for me . project manager: it should {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} It's supposed to be a dolphin , you like the freedom that it {disfmarker} that it represents . industrial designer: Uh-huh . user interface: Like the ocean , like swimming . Do that in my spare time , so that's basically an {disfmarker} project manager: What do you like ? Okay . Well , user interface: Now we can forget this ever happened . project manager: our Marketing Expert .

They are {disfmarker} industrial designer: They are really bad , my drawing skills . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay uh-huh . project manager: Sure looks smooth . marketing: Oh . industrial designer: I'm not sure how the legs should go , but {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh these are stripes . user interface: Got it . {vocalsound} industrial designer: I've picked this animal because it's very fast . It is uh it knows exactly what it wants . Uh it hardly ever wastes any resources . project manager: What does it want ? industrial designer: Uh well , basically uh it hunts for prey , but it does it always in a very well-thought way . Uh it knows exactly what it wants . It never kills an animal uh just for the killing , so it's very efficient . And it tries to do everything as fast as possible . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: And it always goes for uh security , in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything , marketing: Mm . industrial designer: security , speed and efficiency is important . And I think uh those things we can use . project manager: I agree . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . project manager: , I'm supposed to draw the animal next . Yay I introduce to the world the amazing ant . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Uh hard worker . project manager: Great team-workers . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Do everything to Uh really small , but together they're really strong .

Whatever . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Think it need shoes . So {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} I'm just too lazy to draw it all black , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That's the coolest ant ever . user interface: You've done this before , haven't you ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: I love to draw ants . It's my hobby . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Anyway {disfmarker} Nah . {vocalsound} Just {disfmarker} I think it's very representative what we drew , I guess . Like you take {disfmarker} just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Just {disfmarker} Yeah . You're supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have , and just make it a little distinct . Anyway . {gap} another beep to stop the meeting . See . Warning . Finish meeting now . Uh put this down . Examples . Well I guess we have a little little time extra , but {disfmarker} Just a little quick discussion to to open open our work . So what do you guys think about {disfmarker} The first idea is just very short . I'll start with you . What are y What are your first ideas for the new product ? What {disfmarker} user interface: Well , I basically had a question . Do {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} Are we going to introduce a multi remote control ? Is it just the T_V_ or do we want to in project manager: The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control . marketing: Uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: Just for T_V_ remote control . project manager: Yeah , I guess so . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Okay . Well , I was thinking about design remote control , with our uh motto and all . marketing: But {disfmarker} user interface: Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with . marketing: Yeah . user interface: No rational changes or whatever , 'cause it {disfmarker} revolutionary changes , project manager: Okay , so very intuitive design , I guess . user interface: yes . {vocalsound} Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product . So that was something I wanted to add , project manager: {gap} user interface: and perhaps some usability aspect . T_V_ is becoming central in most homes . Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh , yeah , to be able to use it as well ? project manager: Yeah , we want {disfmarker} I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it . So {vocalsound} I think {disfmarker} I mean , really disabled people , yeah , {vocalsound} might be a problem , but I think it's a little {gap} take it into consideration . Um yeah . I think we really need to cut the meeting short . You have anything you wanna share quickly ? industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: Uh . industrial designer: Only one thing uh that has to be added according to me is uh the the material it is made of , it should be something light . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: That's {disfmarker} it speaks for itself , project manager: It should be light , okay . industrial designer: but some uh {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: Um , let's see , marketing: Yeah . project manager: where did I {disfmarker} Let's skip that .
