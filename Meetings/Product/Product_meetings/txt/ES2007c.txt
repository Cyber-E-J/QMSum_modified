marketing: Oh right okay . {vocalsound} I cover myself up . {vocalsound} project manager: I feel like Madonna with one of these on . I said I feel like Madonna with one of these on . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} I've always wanted one of these , I really have . {vocalsound} Where do you buy 'em from ? {vocalsound} They're {gap} . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Right . Hello everybody . user interface: Hello . project manager: Back again for another wonderful meeting . industrial designer: {gap} . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Is uh everyone ready ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Almost . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay , we c we can hold on for a minute . marketing: {vocalsound} Oh my gosh . {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} project manager: I figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm 'kay . project manager: Are you ready ? Okay , right , well , I take it that you are all ready now . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting . Um {vocalsound} which was we got together just to basically decide on {disfmarker} well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: and who we all are and stuff like that , mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . {vocalsound} Um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R_ and D_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: see I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . Um yeah , we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want . user interface: Hmm . {vocalsound} Do you have any preference uh of order ? project manager: Um I'd like to um hear marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first . I want {disfmarker} what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Batteries . user interface: I think she is still finishing her {gap} . {vocalsound} industrial designer: No no no no , it's fine I'm just preparing . project manager: It's just that {disfmarker} yeah , let's let's hear from you first . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Hmm . industrial designer: Where is that thing ? user interface: Okay , it's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: It's here . industrial designer: Oh sorry , couldn't see . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Would that work ? project manager: Get yourself in position . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay , so that's me again . marketing: Ah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is {disfmarker} which was used uh in the fifties for torches , if you remember that kind of {disfmarker} which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v project manager: I don't think any of us remember the fifties . user interface: Is it like a crank thing or something {gap} . industrial designer: yeah , yeah . It wouldn't be very fancy . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: You can have a kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days . So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that {disfmarker} it will give it the energy to work . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Or you can use solar cells , but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but {disfmarker} user interface: Well , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with {disfmarker} but also using some solar power . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Do {gap} sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ? marketing: Mm . project manager: Does anybody know ? industrial designer: I dunno actually . user interface: Uh I think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but I don't know . industrial designer: I dunno . Um . Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , marketing: Mm . industrial designer: but I don't know if it's worth the cost . So we've got to discuss that . project manager: Mm . Okay , jolly good . industrial designer: {vocalsound} For the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , if you know what I mean , so {disfmarker} project manager: What's a double curved one ? industrial designer: You know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium . And th for each of them you have uh cases where {disfmarker} for example titanium , you can't use it for {disfmarker} if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium . And if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account . But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing , so we could uh {disfmarker} project manager: So that might be an idea of using the rubber , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: but then it should , you know {disfmarker} user interface: Let's have a squeezable remote . {vocalsound} project manager: yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . And also it doesn't break as easily maybe , project manager: {gap} when a T_V_ programme's got one {gap} industrial designer: I dunno {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: watching the match and {gap} your team's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , I like that idea . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: So rubber would be {disfmarker} Okay . marketing: I think rubber's {disfmarker} project manager: Rubber , we're all we're all going {disfmarker} we're all liking that idea ? You think you can market that ? marketing: But after my after my fashion thing , I think you'll realise that rubber is more {disfmarker} project manager: Ooh , we like rubber , ooh . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh s so if d marketing: People . {vocalsound} industrial designer: okay . And then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um L_C_D_ , which gives you a display . Um scroll buttons , as well . project manager: Uh-huh . industrial designer: So if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons . project manager: Well , we're gonna go with {gap} I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so {disfmarker} industrial designer: So it's a constraint . Yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ? {vocalsound} If it's not a double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it's a double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons . If that makes sense . project manager: {gap} push buttons instead of the wheel ? industrial designer: Yeah . {gap} . user interface: If it's rubber , isn't it malleable anyway , {gap} it doesn't matter if it's double {disfmarker} I mean isn't a rubber case , mean it's completely flexed , I mean , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double {disfmarker} rubber double curved case ? {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} rubble double double . {vocalsound} industrial designer: No , but na le you see , you've got , okay , the energy that's one thing , project manager: I'll have a Big Mac , please . {vocalsound} industrial designer: then you have the case is uh , whether it's flat or curved . And that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved . And I'm just saying if it {disfmarker} if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go {disfmarker} I dunno why , but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons . So , either {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . industrial designer: I dunno we just need to decide on the on the case . project manager: Let's have rubber push buttons , hey . user interface: Okay . Go rubber . Go rubber the whole way . industrial designer: Let's go crazy . {vocalsound} And then , do I have a last slide ? Yes , I do . Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be {disfmarker} so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Um and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . Uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that's a higher price range . If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive . project manager: {vocalsound} Simple , yeah . Chip on print . It's a bit {gap} . {vocalsound} Okay , uh what I'm not understanding here industrial designer: Mm . project manager: {vocalsound} is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ? industrial designer: {gap} . Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: The infra-red . Yeah . project manager: Right . Um what a what alternatives do we have to that ? {vocalsound} Y um {vocalsound} what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ? industrial designer: Well , if if it's not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red . It's less expensive mm {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} so it sounds {disfmarker} industrial designer: Technically speaking , it's not as advanced , but it does the job , too . {vocalsound} project manager: So , why would we not go for that ? If it's something that's inside the the unit . {vocalsound} I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not . industrial designer: Fo It doesn't , yeah , yeah , yeah . Totally . Yeah . project manager: Um we wanna go for an i i all {vocalsound} industrial designer: So let's not go for the {disfmarker} project manager: so long as it works , industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . I agree . project manager: you know . So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print . industrial designer: So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons . project manager: Yeah . S yeah , push buttons . marketing: What about the just developed uh sample sensor ? user interface: I think push-buttons is {disfmarker} project manager: What about what ? marketing: G there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing . industrial designer: Well {disfmarker} project manager: Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ? marketing: Mm , I dunno . Be cool . industrial designer: It'd be it'd be cool , but they are saying they've just developed it , user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Channel two . {vocalsound} industrial designer: I'm just guessing . But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and {disfmarker} project manager: S user interface: Th the the {vocalsound} speech recognition um option is {disfmarker} it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh , project manager: Yeah . It's not something that we wanna t go into with this product . user interface: 'cause uh {disfmarker} The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , basically , you can program a sample wi um {disfmarker} That when you say something it will give a response , and you program the response as well . Just uh clips of tha that you record yourself . So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello Rick , or whatever . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: But , I mean , it's not {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hm . user interface: it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns {disfmarker} comes on , but it's not that . It just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response . marketing: Oh , it just gives an answer . user interface: So , yeah , I mean , like what's the point of saying , Hello remote , I mean , hello , how how are you ? {vocalsound} marketing: Oh , then then {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Just if you are really lonely , maybe . {vocalsound} marketing: I thought I thought it was {disfmarker} when they said {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , if you're really lonely , it is it's {disfmarker} marketing: I thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant um like , industrial designer: Channel five . And then it switches on . marketing: channel five , and it will change . user interface: No , tha that w that w that would be more promising . marketing: Like you talk to it . Can I have channel five ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: It it's just a remote that talks to you . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: Uh . {vocalsound} I mean to certain cues . marketing: Oh , then {gap} forget about it . Oh right okay . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay , so I'll go back , maybe , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . So for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the {disfmarker} user interface: 'Kay . Yeah , I'm fine with the basic battery . project manager: Basic battery . marketing: Mm . project manager: It's cheap , it's cheerful , it's worked , does work . user interface: Hmm . industrial designer: Cheaper option . Are you happy with that ? marketing: Mm . Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . So we'll go for the battery . Then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ? project manager: We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber , weren't we ? user interface: Yeah , so we want it rub rubber double curved . {vocalsound} project manager: The the {gap} {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: So it will look like something like this . industrial designer: Double ? project manager: The double whopper , please . industrial designer: Okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons , project manager: Yep , but {disfmarker} we're going for the simple buttons . user interface: So rubber rubber keys , yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: and that's fine ? project manager: And it's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it industrial designer: P user interface: Yeah . project manager: as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the R_ {disfmarker} people were getting the {disfmarker} complaining about R_S_I_ , and this is anti-R_S_I_ . marketing: {gap} . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So that's another marketing point that we can use . marketing: Well the rubber push-buttons {gap} . Don't you have to move your {disfmarker} project manager: But anything is gonna have buttons . marketing: Mm . project manager: Even if it's a jog wheel , it's still repetitive . You {disfmarker} industrial designer: I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a {disfmarker} project manager: You see , you can still get {disfmarker} it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen . industrial designer: That they don't . {vocalsound} project manager: It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same {disfmarker} doing the same movement . industrial designer: Mm . user interface: {gap} . project manager: It's not actually what you are doing . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific {disfmarker} marketing: Mm . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , the rubber's good . user interface: We're giving them a way to burn off steam , basically , yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , so they can sit there and go like {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Not that watching T_V_ should be that stressful . project manager: And you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Oh yeah , I guess T_V_ can be stressful , yeah , if you're watching sports . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Alright , that's me done . project manager: Okay , Gabriel . Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's {disfmarker} the interface . user interface: Alright . Alright . Yeah , some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about . project manager: Great . industrial designer: Sorry . user interface: Okay , so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division . It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them . Uh I also took uh Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um , 'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out . project manager: Mm . user interface: Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine . So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: I guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . It's it's pointless . project manager: Mm . user interface: Uh it's just a sample sensor sample output . It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_ . Uh so yeah , they they also give the uh {disfmarker} they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod . project manager: Mm . marketing: Mm . user interface: Um so we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Mm . user interface: Um the other suggestion , marketing: That does get annoying . user interface: and I I have a feeling that we're interested in in something more general , but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have {gap} lot of colours um , the keys might be you know , funny or or {gap} , project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: or uh something for the elderly , where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons . But you know we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Uh {gap} um {disfmarker} So , the key layout and design are really crucial . You don't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um . And I didn't mention that we need a power button {gap} in our last {disfmarker} I can give you an example here of uh , {gap} good layout and bad layout industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: uh from our manufacturing department . So this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so uh project manager: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: it's sort of confusing for the user . Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose . project manager: Do we have an uh example of a good one ? {gap} {vocalsound} Brilliant . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh-huh . Well {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} And for {disfmarker} something for kids . Yeah . Um . project manager: Yeah . user interface: And so , yeah , I th I think my personal preferences of {disfmarker} we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um . Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . I think it should be more general . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us . And , yeah , that's it for me . project manager: Okay . Well let's um {disfmarker} so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? The um {disfmarker} The the um the interface type we're going for {disfmarker} user interface: So we're {disfmarker} we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh . project manager: Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons . user interface: So , yeah , it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons . Um . I think we shall have a limited number of buttons , project manager: Yeah . user interface: ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Uh . And some sort of {disfmarker} it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that . project manager: Yeah . user interface: I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that . project manager: Okay , and we're not {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: Well now that we've decided on our {disfmarker} project manager: {gap} Are we gonna hav hav {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} are we d marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: have we decided on whether w we're gonna s supplement it with anything , you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we're not we're just gonna go for something {disfmarker} user interface: Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy , project manager: We're {disfmarker} marketing: Maybe we can {disfmarker} user interface: but um {disfmarker} Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow , or something like that . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Okey-dokey . Yeah , I don't have any other questions on this . Let's move over to {disfmarker} user interface: I I guess {vocalsound} the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . project manager: Yeah , sure . user interface: I mean , 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button . project manager: {gap} . user interface: But I think that should be {disfmarker} I mean um , I can speak with the button department , but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating . project manager: Yeah , the button that just does that , yeah . user interface: So that should be simple . project manager: Cool . marketing: Right . Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets project manager: Mm yeah . marketing: and what the fashions are for next year . Um . So yes {vocalsound} , so from looking at this year's trends and fashions project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market , we have found that for the remote control market {vocalsound} these are like most important aspects like that we really need to {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: which we've already probably discussed . Um {vocalsound} the most important aspect is look and feel . So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already {disfmarker} that we already have . So it has to be {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_ ? marketing: Yep . user interface: Mm . marketing: Exactly . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative . So {disfmarker} project manager: What's that mean ? marketing: {vocalsound} Technologically it should be like um work , basically , I guess . It should work . user interface: Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense , marketing: Should {disfmarker} user interface: I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market . marketing: That's new . project manager: Okay , now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . Actually , I mean , these first two points we've already sort of gone away from , marketing: Yeah . user interface: 'cause our rubber one is not fancy {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . marketing: Mm . user interface: I mean it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy . If that's what people want then we {disfmarker} maybe we're going in the wrong direction . And it's it's not technologically innovative either . project manager: Maybe we could um {disfmarker} marketing: So , {gap} no loose {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . marketing: That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth , 'cause if you like put up Bluetooth , and it's like a Bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , oh , 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is {vocalsound} , like people {disfmarker} and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , they don't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not . project manager: Of course , they do . marketing: Well , they do , but it's like it's not {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} One hundred per cent , that's your first thing , you go , oh I'm not gonna buy that , 'cause I dunno if it works or not . marketing: Yeah , but it looks good . If it looks good and it's {disfmarker} it can just be there for decoration . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , well , what do you two think about this ? user interface: So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other marketing: But like {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , what {disfmarker} I don't understand what m user interface: electronics ? marketing: You could always insert , yeah . user interface: Yeah , that's basically what it allows you to do , project manager: Yeah , user interface: right ? project manager: and it {disfmarker} this is just gonna {gap} {disfmarker} all this is being used for is your television . marketing: Yeah , but , I mean , people like {disfmarker} project manager: It would {disfmarker} that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does , marketing: Well , if you're looking at {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if you {gap} looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art . industrial designer: Well {disfmarker} project manager: does it ? That would mean we'd have to make a television as well . industrial designer: Bluetooth would , for example , enable you , I think , to um um connect {disfmarker} for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now . Things like that . project manager: No , that would be your telephone {gap} in with your television . industrial designer: No i user interface: Yeah , the {disfmarker} that wouldn't be the remote so much , project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , user interface: I mean {disfmarker} project manager: and i industrial designer: No , but if you get Bluetooth on the remote , you'd be able to {disfmarker} project manager: Nah , the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible , basically . industrial designer: I with the television , yeah . {gap} I was just trying to find an advantage . Wha what w what advantage would you get for the {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . marketing: Well , it doesn't {disfmarker} project manager: An and there is no there is no such thing marketing: Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth , that was just an idea , but like it needs do something that , you know , is new . Whether it's a battery {disfmarker} it could be something really really minor , you know , like {disfmarker} but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people've already seen it , people've already got it . project manager: Okay . marketing: If we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have and um just go creative . industrial designer: Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then . It's been done for watches , but I haven't seen that for remotes , yet . project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Yeah , this {disfmarker} that's that's very good . marketing: And then you can market it . Never have to change a battery again . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Change the batteries ever again . project manager: And and this is all tying in very nicely . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: The fact that it's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about . Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , well , and in little characters you say , yeah , but not too much . {vocalsound} user interface: Yes , so can {disfmarker} project manager: But yeah , by the squeezing it the {disfmarker} marketing: I think , safety s user interface: Yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating {disfmarker} like the energy generator . project manager: Yeah , that's a great idea . Well done . marketing: Yeah . Third most important aspect {vocalsound} uh is it's easy to use . user interface: {vocalsound} {gap} we're all about that . marketing: And I think we've all um worked that out . Um okay , in the fashion , how it's supposed to look . Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . {vocalsound} So next year people will be buying {vocalsound} , I found this really funny {vocalsound} , you know , strawberry shaped chairs , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: I wanna watch the pineapple channel . {vocalsound} marketing: Rubber things . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , so it's it's not quite spongy , but spongy , I would say is {disfmarker} user interface: {gap} . project manager: Well spongy , that's where {gap} . Yeah , we're we're ahead of the game there . user interface: Yeah , that's great for us . marketing: yeah , so we're in . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . And so personal {gap} what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , while still keeping to the company's image , basically . So yeah . project manager: Okay . marketing: {gap} . I had to say {disfmarker} user interface: Right . marketing: So we're moving in the right direction like {disfmarker} project manager: Alright , yeah , no , this i this is good , user interface: Yeah . project manager: so through all that we've {disfmarker} we go we're {disfmarker} right , we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing , industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yep . user interface: Yeah , that's great . project manager: that's great , using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-R_S_I_ you can {disfmarker} as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries {vocalsound} , marketing: {vocalsound} Mm . project manager: and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though . industrial designer: {vocalsound} No vegetables . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , I don't know how we incorporate {disfmarker} project manager: {gap} . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: We don't have to follow every trend , I guess . marketing: Maybe make it like fruity colours or something . user interface: Uh-huh . marketing: Some sort . Or {disfmarker} user interface: The power button could be like a big apple or something . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Well yeah , but Apple would sue you for that . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , this is true {gap} . {vocalsound} user interface: They don they don't own {vocalsound} all images of apples . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {gap} sued the Beatles so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Okay , we'll make it a uh pomegranate , a big pomegranate . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Well , okay , it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is its image . Like , yeah , we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be , user interface: {gap} . project manager: or like are we going {disfmarker} yeah it looks slick , but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ? marketing: Well {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I think , if it's rubber it needs to be project manager: I mean you said earlier on i {vocalsound} it should be funky . marketing: different . I think , it's {disfmarker} it should be {disfmarker} I mean , what do you associate with rubber ? You know like project manager: {vocalsound} L keep it clean , keep it clean . {vocalsound} marketing: really different colours basically . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay , sor I sorry , I used the wrong word , what do you associate with the mate the material {vocalsound} that material ? {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Um like I'm just thinking bright colours . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Bright natural colours , nothing too {disfmarker} project manager: Bright , but not too bright . {vocalsound} marketing: Bright , but too {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink . Wanna make it different colours so {vocalsound} anybody can choo like like {gap} {disfmarker} project manager: Like the volume buttons should be the {disfmarker} all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ? user interface: Mm . marketing: Yeah . And on the back of it have the logo . project manager: Okay , what {gap} ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Sure . industrial designer: Why not ? project manager: Okay . Tha user interface: The one thing I'm wondering about , I hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , I mean we {disfmarker} that's we we {disfmarker} user interface: I mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes , and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} This is the remote control tomato . {vocalsound} user interface: I mean {vocalsound} what are ninety per cent of people gonna take ? {vocalsound} marketing: Well {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I can say in this country , you'll get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool . Like {disfmarker} and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , Mummy I wanna buy that one . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} And uh parents will see the will see the pro as well , because it's um like kids won't break it , it's not breakable if you throw it around . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Especially with younger kids , you know they can pick it up and and {disfmarker} Yeah . The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: Well , it's it's gotta be chew proof . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {gap} I'm gonna write that down . marketing: So {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} {gap} marketing: so it's rea it's quite project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: it's quite like um user friendly industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: and also for different families , like like family use as well , so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , I think . Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like {gap} pink remote control for their room something . project manager: So , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the {disfmarker} industrial designer: That's {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: Mm . marketing: So like you walk in , you're like , oh I like that remote control , because it's so bright , and then , and then the shop assistant comes up and says , oh what colour would you like ? and then they go like , oh I can choose the colour {vocalsound} wow . So it puts , I think , even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of , you've got all colour it's either that or nothing . So they also get to pick . Well , personally I like walking into a shop and choosing a colour . user interface: Yeah I mean , that that seems to work well with for products like iPod , marketing: It's um {disfmarker} user interface: where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing . project manager: Mm . marketing: Yeah . Mm . industrial designer: Although I'd be curious to see how many uh {disfmarker} marketing: D you've got the {disfmarker} industrial designer: You know , there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose , and I would be curious how many people choose that colour . project manager: Well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know , user interface: Right . project manager: if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular . industrial designer: Mm . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: And produce less of the silly colours , maybe . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay .
