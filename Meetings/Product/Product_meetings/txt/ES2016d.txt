project manager: Yep . Soon as I get this . Okay . This is our last meeting . Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation . {vocalsound} Um then we will um do an evaluation . Uh or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . Um then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line . Um let's see , minutes from the last meeting . Um we looked at uh the the trends . We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . It was twice as important as anything else . Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . Um and a spongy feel . So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . Um looking at other other devices . Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that . Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . Um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . But I think we've still decided not to go with that . {vocalsound} Then we looked at the components um the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . Um and basically how , what were making for the prototype . So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over . user interface: The prototype discussion . project manager: The prototype yeah . Do you need a {disfmarker} this ? user interface: No . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Can try to plug that in there user interface: There is our remo {gap} the banana . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: but {disfmarker} user interface: Um {vocalsound} yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow . Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Um but it would be held in such a fashion , marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: where it is , obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic . These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . So that's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . You have to use your imagination a little bit . And this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through . project manager: Very nice . user interface: And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . Volume up and down . And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . It's that that simple . That just represents the infrared uh beam . That's a simple on and off switch . Um I don't know , we could use the voice . T that blue bits should be yellow , that that'd be where the batteries would be I suppose . And um {vocalsound} that's about it . It's as simple as you , we could make it really . industrial designer: Right . user interface: Is there anything you want to add ? industrial designer: That's what we have there . That's plastic . Plastic covered with rubber . We might uh add some more underneath here . Maybe give it , give it a form . I mean you're supposed to hold it like that , but um just if you grab it , take it from somewhere , user interface: Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: so {disfmarker} yeah , user interface: Doesn't make much make much difference . industrial designer: you have some rub yeah . user interface: You could work left-handed or right-handed I suppose . industrial designer: Exactly , {gap} use both . Might as well think about {disfmarker} user interface: T the actual thing might be smaller . industrial designer: Th think about the button as well . Like either put either one {gap} one on either side or user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: What but what's that button ? industrial designer: not do it at all . It's a quick on-off button . user interface: Just the on and off . project manager: Uh , 'kay . industrial designer: That's um marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: yeah I think it's pretty important . So you don't have to fiddle with that . project manager: 'Kay . industrial designer: Right ? Um that's not um {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice . You wanna play with that over there . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: There you go . user interface: It's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy Play-Doh , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Would you like to uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Right . user interface: but {disfmarker} marketing: Pretty impressive . project manager: Well done . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Kind of a banana . user interface: And whether or not it would fall into the cost {gap} everything I suppose . With the scroll and the L_C_D_ . project manager: Well luckily we are going to find out . Or not luckily . Um do you have a marketing presentation for us . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} I do . Okay . You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria . Um . Okay . So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found . Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier . And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype . And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did . Um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . So we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale . And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . With seven being false , we did not achieve that . {gap} . Okay . So for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: I think it's definitely different than anything else out there . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Mm . user interface: Yeah . project manager: So if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes I would say , I would say most definitely . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: I would {gap} . project manager: It's bright . user interface: It's bright . It's {disfmarker} project manager: It still has your traditional black . user interface: It's curved . It's not {disfmarker} there's no sharp industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: angles to it . project manager: Yep , not angular . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: I'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: However the colour , we don't have a say in that . marketing: Yeah I think the colours detract a little bit . {vocalsound} user interface: Some people might say it . Yeah . industrial designer: That has been , that has been dictated pretty much by the company . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely . project manager: {vocalsound} Yep . marketing: That's true . Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: 'S nothing you can say about that . I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: But {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah something more modern to go {disfmarker} a a modern colour to go with the modern form . industrial designer: Right . Right . It's different . You don't want your uh three feet huge L_C_D_ dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that . marketing: Um okay so , do you think , since we {disfmarker} This was a a sign criteria , do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ? industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Does that sound good ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: What do you think ? Three ? Four ? project manager: I would say marketing: Five ? project manager: four . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Four is fair . Okay . project manager: Very non-committal , four . marketing: Okay , the second one . Did we make it simple for new users ? industrial designer: It's very intuitive , I think yeah . user interface: Yeah . I think that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had . industrial designer: {vocalsound} S give it a one . marketing: One , project manager: Yeah . marketing: 'kay . Okay . Um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ? user interface: Uh yeah . 'Cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls {gap} most common , which are channel and volume . marketing: I'd say that {disfmarker} project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Right . user interface: And then the other ones are just a matter of just going , just scrolling further . project manager: S scrolling through and selecting a few . industrial designer: Right . So that's a one . marketing: So one ? project manager: I think that's a one . marketing: Yeah ? {vocalsound} Okay . Okay um the fourth one . How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? One of the number one complaints . industrial designer: Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Whether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it . {vocalsound} user interface: It's bright yellow . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Bright yellow's hard to lose . But um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . That , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . That was what we'd we'd mentioned . project manager: So if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could {disfmarker} user interface: Just just to use , to find it when it was lost . But like I said , like I don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily . industrial designer: Oops . Hmm . user interface: And it's not gonna fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things . That's gonna be a difficult shape to {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well what {disfmarker} project manager: And it is quite bright and {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Maybe in the middle again , three or four or something ? project manager: Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: S marketing: Okay . user interface: I mean you know {gap} loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , I mean a million ways . project manager: Yeah . user interface: You can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: That's true . project manager: But if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite a bit I think . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Oh yeah . You probably {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Probably two . You know . If we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Mm . project manager: I'd say two . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: With the speech recognition , which of course may be changed depending on budget . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Y you could add an extra feature actually . Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: We could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far . project manager: Which , which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes . user interface: Yeah true . But I mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have . They're cheap . marketing: Annoying alarm or something ? project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: It's it's {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: So it can't be that industrial designer: Um the {disfmarker} it's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and stuff , user interface: expensive . project manager: Some sort of proximity {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping . That can't cost much . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide , so you have one piece , you have to glue somewhere behind your {disfmarker} stick it behind your T_V_ and the other {disfmarker} user interface: {gap} stick it on the T_V_ {gap} . project manager: {vocalsound} Pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Right . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: That'd be tough then . {vocalsound} Well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television , yeah . Ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: So . Are we adding one of these two features ? industrial designer: Let's add one of those features and say yes . {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} gonna say {disfmarker} okay . project manager: Okay . marketing: So we're {vocalsound} back to a one ? user interface: Two . marketing: Or a two ? project manager: Two . industrial designer: Two . marketing: Two , 'kay . Okay . Are we technologically innovative ? industrial designer: Uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} I'd say so . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Uh don't get many mo remote controls with industrial designer: It's all just {disfmarker} user interface: screens on . industrial designer: It's all just stolen technology when it comes down to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah it's stolen technology . marketing: From iPod yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: But we have {gap} . project manager: But there's not a lot of yellow , there's not a lotta yellow . industrial designer: right marketing: But for remotes {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: Course that wasn't really {disfmarker} industrial designer: right user interface: Fa industrial designer: right right . project manager: we were kinda forced to take that colour . marketing: Two ? Three ? user interface: {gap} 'cause it's stolen . project manager: I don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth . {vocalsound} user interface: No maybe not . industrial designer: Yeah not really . marketing: But how many remotes do you see like this ? user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: If we added the screaming factor {vocalsound} then we go up . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Not so many . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Um I would say we're probably at four . industrial designer: Right . marketing: Really ? Okay . {vocalsound} That's gonna hurt us . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . Um spongy material ? industrial designer: Yeah well you have that , kind of , sort of . project manager: We have some spongy , yeah . user interface: Yeah as much as as needed , I think . marketing: 'Kay . industrial designer: It's not a one though . project manager: No . industrial designer: One would be the whole thing project manager: Yeah . Because it's only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side {disfmarker} the bottom {disfmarker} the underneath on the back . industrial designer: to fold and stuff . Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So that's a four at most . project manager: Probably a four at most . Possibly even a five . marketing: And lastly , did we put the fashion in electronics ? project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Y yes . user interface: Yeah . marketing: I'd say we did . project manager: If your fashion is b is Carmen Miranda , you betcha . {vocalsound} industrial designer: More {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the L_C_D_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour , user interface: On the {disfmarker} project manager: It's true . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: but it definitely is {disfmarker} user interface: Be what we were told , and they'd say yeah , definitely . industrial designer: {gap} . marketing: 'Kay . Alright . Now we just gotta calculate . Six eight twelve sixteen . Seventeen divided by s user interface: {gap} . project manager: Seven is {disfmarker} marketing: Eight . project manager: Two point {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} two point four ? user interface: Is that some long division ? No . project manager: Something . marketing: Well I haven't done math in years . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: What two {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} I dunno . user interface: Just , I'm sure there's a {gap} . marketing: Okay we'll say two point four two . Right ? How does that look ? industrial designer: I'm impressed . I can't do that without a calculator . {vocalsound} user interface: No I can't do long {gap} marketing: {vocalsound} It's been a while . user interface: very impressive . project manager: And what what is the acceptable criteria ? Is there like a scale that we have to hit ? marketing: Oh no . They just told me to industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it {vocalsound} basically . project manager: {vocalsound} Alright then . marketing: So that's that . project manager: Okay . Well , let's see . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Now we get to do the budget numbers . You didn't know that you were gonna have a budget . But we do . Okay . user interface: Yeah . Yeah so . You'd been going a long time dividing that . It's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on . marketing: Oh my god . user interface: Two point four two basically . marketing: Okay . Yeah we'll go with that . project manager: So I have here an {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Fifty percent , you're kidding . marketing: Not too shabby . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} P project manager: We want a fifty percent profit on this . Oh you can't really see that very well . user interface: {vocalsound} Charge about three hundred quid for it . project manager: {vocalsound} Twelve and a half Euros is what supposed to cost us . Okay , so {disfmarker} industrial designer: It's too much . project manager: Well let's see . industrial designer: Um {disfmarker} project manager: The f the {disfmarker} Wonder if I can make this {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: What the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh it won't let me do that . Okay . Alright so at top , I don't know if you guys can read that or not . I can't 'cause I don't have my glasses on , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: but so we've got the energy source . There's uh four , five , six categories . industrial designer: Battery . project manager: We have energy source , electronics , case . Then we have case material supplements , interface type , and then button supplements . Okay so {disfmarker} Uh first of all energy source , we picked battery . Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ? user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Probably some e either two or four . industrial designer: Two . project manager: Two ? {vocalsound} Like it . {vocalsound} industrial designer: At four it's gonna be too heavy , so that that's not our problem . People can change it every month . project manager: {vocalsound} Excellent . industrial designer: {vocalsound} They won't know until after they bought it . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: This is consumerism . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip-on-print , regular chip-on-print , advanced chip-on-print , sample sensor , sample speaker . industrial designer: {gap} . user interface: We're advanced chip are we ? industrial designer: That's the advanced chip-on-print , yeah . project manager: 'Kay , {gap} we have one of those . 'Kay then the case is a {disfmarker} Probably it's double curved . industrial designer: Double curved , yes . project manager: Case materials are industrial designer: Plastic . project manager: plastic . Um I guess it's two , since one for the top , one for the bottom . industrial designer: N no . project manager: Is that right or is it just one ? industrial designer: No that's just one . project manager: Maybe it's one because of the {disfmarker} industrial designer: It's just one mo single mould , we can do that . project manager: 'Kay . user interface: Yeah {gap} yeah . marketing: Right . {vocalsound} project manager: I guess it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero , which is nice . industrial designer: Exactly , right . marketing: Oh . project manager: Special colour ? industrial designer: That's not a special colour . It's a specially ugly colour , but it's not special . marketing: Bright yellow . project manager: {vocalsound} Interface type . We have pushbutton , scroll-wheel interface , integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton , and an L_C_D_ display . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: S industrial designer: S {vocalsound} user interface: That's {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: So we actually have the L_C_D_ display marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: And then {disfmarker} project manager: and then is it the integrated or is it {disfmarker} user interface: I'd say the integrated . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes unfortunately . project manager: 'Kay . Button supplement ? Special colour ? user interface: Mm . project manager: Um special form ? Special material . industrial designer: We could of course make the buttons wood . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Say mahogany or so marketing: {vocalsound} It'd look really lovely . project manager: Or titanium . industrial designer: Mm-hmm or titanium . project manager: They cost us all the same . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: {gap} remote control {gap} . project manager: Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged , industrial designer: Uh just {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements . user interface: No that's getting a bit tiny . project manager: Um {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: I'd ignore that . marketing: Leave it blank . project manager: Okay . We're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a L_C_D_ and scroll . So our total is fifteen point five . Which I believe is industrial designer: Yeah that's too much . project manager: by three Euros over . industrial designer: It's hard to believe . So we'll go for the hand dynamo huh ? {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: So the only thing better than um a banana-shaped remote is one that you shake . user interface: If it w What if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: And just had a scroll wheel interface . And the L_C_D_ display . I suppose the L_C_D_ C_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though . project manager: Yeah 'cause the {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Well 'cause we have to have both right ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: I mean let's let's face it , it also depends on the software on the on the television . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: You can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: So s yeah let's take away the {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even , industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the T_V_ itself . industrial designer: Right . project manager: So we may not need the L_C_D_ display ? user interface: Uh that is possible yeah . industrial designer: Right . We may not need it . There you go . project manager: Well there we go . industrial designer: Perfect . project manager: Twelve point five . user interface: There we go . marketing: {vocalsound} Perfect . project manager: Okay . So we just remove our {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Screen . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: screen here . user interface: Make it a bigger dial . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Easier to use . Even easier to use then . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay , the {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Besides look at what the L_C_D_ does to our lovely remote . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Back to the design room boys . industrial designer: So we can just take away a heck of a lot of the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} . industrial designer: there you go . {gap} central ? marketing: What's the blue part ? user interface: That was just {disfmarker} industrial designer: Oh that's just {disfmarker} user interface: we ran out of yellow . {vocalsound} marketing: Oh that's the batteries . industrial designer: yeah . marketing: Okay . {vocalsound} industrial designer: There you go user interface: There you go . industrial designer: . Oops . user interface: Even simpler . marketing: {vocalsound} Looks more like a banana . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: There you go . user interface: For all those fruit lovers out there . industrial designer: One more criteria . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Okay so the costs under twelve point five Euro . Was no . We redesigned it . Now it's yes . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Next slide . Project evaluation . Uh project process , satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , new ideas found . Um {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} I guess that {disfmarker} Let's see here . I think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me . But I'd like to hear your thoughts . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Fair enough . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Trying to fill in some time there . {vocalsound} project manager: Uh h what did you think of our project process ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: Great . {vocalsound} user interface: I think we did {disfmarker} yeah I think we did quite well . Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Good . marketing: Good teamwork {gap} . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Just half a day , you have a remote . There you go . user interface: Yeah . Right from the start of the day . project manager: Yeah I think {disfmarker} user interface: We sort of knew where we were going straight away I thought . project manager: {gap} we st we started off a little little weak . Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Um {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing . Um room for creativity ? There was that . Um I think we tried a lotta different things and um I think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things . Um you guys worked together well as a team . And um the means ? Which was the whiteboard and the pens . user interface: Yeah . We've used the whiteboard . industrial designer: Super super . project manager: I had some problem with the pen I think , but {vocalsound} minus your p marketing: Minus your PowerPoint fiasco . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well that's not my fault . That's obviously the people I work for uh that work for me , marketing: No I know . I'm {disfmarker} project manager: Well {disfmarker} marketing: yeah . Incom {vocalsound} industrial designer: uh they've just you know {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Have a {disfmarker} industrial designer: Heads are gonna roll , believe me . project manager: we have a list of employees that you would like fired . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yes yes . project manager: Okay . N new ideas found ? Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Mm . Kinda . project manager: Yes for the remote . Maybe no not f for user interface: Technology used . project manager: technology . Alright . Closing . Costs are within the budget . Project is evaluated . Um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary . That's it . user interface: Excellent . project manager: And I still have to do my minutes for the last meeting . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Actually . Um so there will probably be another questionnaire coming up . And then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can , what goes on after that . marketing: We might have a while though . industrial designer: {gap} . project manager: But that's the end of our meeting .
