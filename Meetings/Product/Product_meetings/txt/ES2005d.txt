user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Okay , almost there . project manager: Okay . We'll sta I'll use the PowerPoint , I guess . How was that , was that fun ? user interface: Mm . Very fun . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . Uh oh I've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but I will do . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Hmm . project manager: {vocalsound} Upsidaisy . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um we {disfmarker} marketing: E excuse me I forgot my project manager: Yeah . marketing: copy . {gap} project manager: Alright , okay , yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: He's gonna get his pen . user interface: Oh right . Okay . project manager: Um {vocalsound} Will you guys first with your prototype um before we get to the good news ? industrial designer: Yeah , there's good news ? project manager: Uh {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Oh . user interface: Mm . project manager: we have budget problems . industrial designer: Oh . Cutbacks . project manager: I'm afraid you're all sacked . Oops . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: I don't even have this on . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay , have you got a presentation to make ? industrial designer: Okay . marketing: No , not mine yet . project manager: No . Okay industrial designer: Oh . project manager: so it's just your your show . industrial designer: Um maybe we should bring {gap} so that the camera can see {gap} . Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . Sure . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: We made three for you . project manager: Three ? Oh . user interface: Um one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato project manager: Tomato ? What tomato ? {vocalsound} user interface: and the other one is st marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: I don't recall a tomato . {vocalsound} user interface: Look . Oh yeah , well yeah , we had v some red left over . project manager: Ah I see , okay . {vocalsound} user interface: So . Okay , so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , or as mm few buttons as possible , project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: mainly speak recognition . The yellow there is the um project manager: Logo . user interface: the slogan , yeah , project manager: Okay , brilliant . user interface: that we need to incorporate , it's very simple . If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , project manager: Okay . user interface: um but mainly it's speech recognition . project manager: Okay , so the buttons would be like , you know individual users , or {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah and {vocalsound} yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there . project manager: Alright , okay . user interface: Mm I'm not sure about that . Um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier . project manager: Right . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , you guys can have a look at that if you want . project manager: That's groovy . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {gap} marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} Uh can I have {gap} project manager: {vocalsound} Well I like the feel of it , I like the feel of it . user interface: Yeah , sure . Um that one is {disfmarker} marketing: Oh sorry s {vocalsound} user interface: Oh no , it's delicate . project manager: At Oh dear . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: That's that's already got its stand that one . That's it stand . project manager: Alright , okay . user interface: It does also lie flat , but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand . project manager: Okay , brilliant mm . user interface: Um the black on the back is the slogan . project manager: Okay , nice and obvious there {vocalsound} , user interface: Uh yeah , that {gap} {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Well , we did think of that . project manager: if it's standing up , I guess , yeah . user interface: Yeah , if it's standing up it's it's on there , but also we're gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle . project manager: Oh right , okay , brilliant . Like that from its centre . user interface: So um and that's the um transmit the L_E_D_ thing . These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . We n were weren't sure about putting them there , because um i it's it kind of could get bashed . project manager: Where you're , yeah , uh were you're holding it kind of {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . Well , if you hold it , you can {disfmarker} you all can hold it , is {disfmarker} it does actually feel quite ergonomic , project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: if you've got small hands . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} Um , obviously I don't think that's real sized {gap} . project manager: Yeah , okay . user interface: It would have to be a bit bigger . project manager: Yeah , scale model , yeah . user interface: Okay . Um that's a speaker at the top , so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Um and {vocalsound} um then the buttons . Yeah kind of self-explanatory , just buttons whenever you need them . Tried to keep it simple . Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom . project manager: {vocalsound} Alright , excellent . user interface: {vocalsound} We used those {gap} . And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one . project manager: Okay . user interface: It's not in the traditional place , project manager: No . user interface: but um it's quite an obvious place . project manager: It's out of the way as well , I suppose , so . Excellent . user interface: So {vocalsound} there we go and and um we have the banana-based one too . industrial designer: Oh yeah , yeah . project manager: Yep . {vocalsound} industrial designer: This one is uh , I suppose for the younger audiences . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: A a more friendly type of {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , {vocalsound} so so Barney the banana {gap} . industrial designer: Right , right . It's to uh induce more television watching I suppose or {disfmarker} project manager: Ah excellent , just what we need . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Say it for the camera . project manager: {vocalsound} Lo Sort of Loch Ness banana . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Right , right . project manager: Cool {gap} yeah . Well , nice to have uh options at least . industrial designer: Yep . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . project manager: 'Kay and {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} So are there any um improvements or issues or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: It won't stand . project manager: Oh there are issues , oh there are issues . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Just let it lie down , it wont stand . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Oh . project manager: Uh , let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Um {vocalsound} unfortunately the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros . marketing: Mm . user interface: Oh . project manager: So we have to industrial designer: What's on the uh on the left ? {gap} project manager: rea Sorry , I've accidentally highlighted somehow {disfmarker} Um . {vocalsound} There we go . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Oh god , why is it doing that ? user interface: Ooh . project manager: There we go . {vocalsound} So basically , um in order to save our two Euros um I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Um . user interface: More like a traditional remote control . project manager: Yeah , I mean it's already got a kind of cool shape , so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out . user interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . project manager: And by doing so {disfmarker} Oh no , hold on . Doesn't save us quite as much . I don't know what's going on with this again . industrial designer: W why is the uh double curved two of them ? project manager: Oh , good point . marketing: And double curve on both sides ? project manager: Um . marketing: Curve {vocalsound} . Yeah , this is double-curve , project manager: That's {vocalsound} sort of curve in and out . marketing: no ? industrial designer: Is i marketing: This is double-curve . It {disfmarker} This one is single curve . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: 'Cause this is single curve , this is curved on both sides . So double-curve . project manager: No , I think it means double curved as in um user interface: Like an S_ shape . project manager: like uh {gap} a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward . user interface: Okay . project manager: Okay , I might be wrong though . marketing: Like this , one curve on this side , one curve on that side . project manager: I don't think that counts as a curve , I think that's just a shape . marketing: Hmm . Hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: A curvature is like the {disfmarker} this case . user interface: Okay . marketing: Maybe . industrial designer: {vocalsound} 'Cause that's the uh the biggest expense there , right . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: {gap} got two of them {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , and why why I've got it two , I don't know , I can't seem to select any more however . industrial designer: Okay . Well we can work around that um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Right . No . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Cut things out . But you think it should be one . project manager: It's meant to be one , yeah , I don't know why I put two in there , industrial designer: Okay . project manager: but um {disfmarker} Hold on till I find it , I think this shift button might be stuck again . No maybe the shift button's stuck in . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm . project manager: {vocalsound} Um okay , so that would take away three , which would give us {disfmarker} marketing: Should {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Oh that's fine . industrial designer: Yeah , so we're {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty . user interface: Cool . Cool . project manager: Um {vocalsound} user interface: So we could even add something . project manager: We cou Oh not quite , have the scroll-wheel , unfortunately . industrial designer: We should fire the accountants . project manager: What ? industrial designer: Fire the accountants . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Ah yeah , we could add things . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell , where you're starting from , and then use the arrow keys . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Does that work ? project manager: Yeah , I know , that just extends it as well . industrial designer: No mm {vocalsound} . marketing: Uh you can do one thing {gap} . project manager: I don't know . marketing: You just select one box outsi yeah , this box . Then move it with the help of this {disfmarker} Okay . project manager: It {disfmarker} One of the buttons is sticking , I don't know {gap} . marketing: {vocalsound} Just uh just uh {disfmarker} Okay , just a minute . Okay . No input , like this . {vocalsound} Shift . No it's not . project manager: No , it's 'cause the uh the shift button's stuck , or something . marketing: Yeah , it's not working . industrial designer: Is it the other shift button maybe ? marketing: Should we ask Meli project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Should we ask our technical expert Melissa ? project manager: {vocalsound} No that's fine . Um we've worked out what it would be anyway . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Did you try both shift buttons ? It could be the other side . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Cancel . Piss off . industrial designer: That's too bad . project manager: Oh well , never mind . Um {vocalsound} . Right , so that's finances and I dunno what we {disfmarker} what could we reckon we could add ? Um user interface: Well maybe we could add something , but maybe if {disfmarker} project manager: Well I suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got . So {disfmarker} user interface: What do you th We're trying to save money , so . Yeah , if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to . project manager: Yeah . user interface: But if there is anything you think we've missed out there , then , you know , feel free to add it . Maybe {disfmarker} I mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front , project manager: Yeah yeah . user interface: because it's not in an ideal place right now . project manager: Well that's that's uh {disfmarker} Okay , so project evaluation . We have under twelve {vocalsound} Euros fifty . Project process , how do we think that went ? Are we happy ? industrial designer: Oh . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Yeah I think we have a a winning product . project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Evaluation . Oh we've been writing this up for m months . user interface: I think it went quite smoothly . project manager: Uh room for creativity , were we happy with that ? user interface: W I think we were very creative . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: No , I mea I think it means sort of individually . user interface: Oh right , okay . project manager: Yes , no , maybe ? user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Okay . Groovy . So uh we're just gonna . Uh yeah , okay . Teamwork ? Leadership , sorry . industrial designer: Great leadership . {vocalsound} user interface: Excellent leadership . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Thank you very much .

Um industrial designer: {vocalsound} These pens are are neat though . project manager: I don't know what , new ideas found , means , to be honest . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , these are new ideas , like glow-in-the-dark or something like that . We discussed all the new ideas , but of course we couldn't reach any proper goals , we couldn't use these {gap} , but we h we are using these scroll buttons like this . These are new ideas we And new shapes , everything project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: . At le {vocalsound} project manager: Mm 'kay . Groovy . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So just general thumbs up for all of us then . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Hmm . project manager: That kind of unfortunately is too quick . marketing: Hmm . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Well um . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Uh {vocalsound} . I suppose yeah . Um . industrial designer: Uh so let's talk about our bonuses and the raises we're getting for this , right . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} That's it , um I think another couple of days holiday pay might be well in order for all of you . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Right , right . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Let's see if I can get this bloody thing to work . industrial designer: Uh maybe we should start cleaning up the clay . project manager: Whoops . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , maybe . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: So {disfmarker} project manager: Does it go back in , does it ? Reusable . industrial designer: {gap} user interface: {gap} industrial designer: Something we should get {gap} . project manager: I don't know what this is but it's really really annoying . marketing: So {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Uh Brian , have you have you finished ? project manager: Uh-huh . marketing: Uh mine needs also this . project manager: Um I have , yes . marketing: At last mine is also the presentation . project manager: Huh ?

Is it ? Okay . marketing: Uh {vocalsound} is the project evaluated , that is mine . project manager: {vocalsound} Doesn't tell me . {vocalsound} Oh you're doing that . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: We evaluated ourselves , we thought we were great . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh . user interface: Mm , love to eat that now . industrial designer: Anybody {vocalsound} user interface: Kind of a green banana now . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: Clay covered banana . user interface: It's {disfmarker} this as well , sorry , we forgot to mention it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex , new material that we've got . project manager: O okay , hold on . user interface: {vocalsound} I've got . industrial designer: {gap} blue . user interface: {gap} project manager: {vocalsound} I wonder w which cell do I want . {gap} industrial designer: It's fun to touch . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} So . Yeah . project manager: Okay , I didn't realise you had that bit . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} So . user interface: Oh could you pass the tomato please . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Sorry . Thank you . marketing: So now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product . How we are going to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: means uh at what standard what standard {disfmarker} whether it meets our standards or not . How mu What rating we will give to these products . So of course this is {disfmarker} will be a team work , w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this . project manager: Okay . marketing: We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product . Then trends , whether it is as {gap} fashion trends or not ? Means {vocalsound} because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: So this is also an important factor for our evaluation also . Then marketing strategy of the company . As we have already discussed that our company is quite {gap} in the market , not only in terms of providing quality products , not only in pro providing latest technologies , but also in terms of providing environmental s user interface: Sorry {gap} . Sorry , marketing: Yeah . user interface: carry on . {vocalsound} marketing: So {vocalsound} but also in terms of providing environmental safe products , uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues . So {disfmarker} Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . I'm having this scale this scale , project manager: Okay . marketing: so we have to do it on a board . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: {gap} marketing: {gap} the user requirem I think . project manager: Alright , okay . user interface: Okay . project manager: The board working again , is it ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Do we have the uh the marker for the board ? project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} project manager: {vocalsound} Uh . user interface: Um . industrial designer: There it is . marketing: {vocalsound} Thank you . project manager: {vocalsound} {gap} marketing: So . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} So these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product . First of all uh comes user requirement . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: So we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not . I I will {disfmarker} first I would like to have your views , what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ? user interface: Um {vocalsound} I think {disfmarker} Yeah , it did . marketing: S user interface: It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Um so . project manager: When the user requirement is essentially just to operate the T_V_ , user interface: Does it work ? project manager: so yeah , user interface: Yeah . So . marketing: {vocalsound} So what do you think you will personally give . project manager: of course we haven't actually got a working model yet . user interface: I would say seven . marketing: Seven . Uh . user interface: {vocalsound} Seven is good , yeah , isn't it ? I can't {disfmarker} True or false ? No sorry tr one is true . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: One , yeah . marketing: Uh one is {disfmarker} means highest ranking , okay . user interface: Yeah . marketing: But I think highest ranking is seven , or one ? project manager: No it's it's like true is one end , and false is the oth industrial designer: No that's false . marketing: Okay , right right . So it's one for from your point of view . user interface: Okay , so one . marketing: And what do you say our Industrial Expert ? user interface: Yep . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Uh . It's hard to know . I I give it a two . {vocalsound} marketing: Uh d you can you can tell on on the like {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: I think she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our i Interface Expert . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: But you can give your views based on technology , whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ? industrial designer: Um yeah , I think i it might even exceed it um . But I guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Um {gap} I'm gonna give it a two . marketing: Two . industrial designer: Two . marketing: And what about uh you , Brian ? project manager: Oh , I'll go for a one . {vocalsound} marketing: You will go for one . project manager: Basic requirements but of the pro of the project . marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . Uh for me personally it is everything fine , it may be having good design , it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise , price-wise , but there is one thing which limits the customers , like we are having only two , three designs , like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah th {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: and user interface: Mm {vocalsound} yellow . marketing: {disfmarker} Uh yeah , lower end . And the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: But if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him . user interface: Uh-huh . project manager: Come on that was the tha {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: No , don't buy our product , because we are l we like this only . project manager: {vocalsound} 'Kay . user interface: Uh-huh . marketing: So we are showing our preference for particular fruits , user interface: Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Being fruitist . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: two or three kinds rather , and {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} So . user interface: Is that no is that not trends ? marketing: Uh no , uh personally as a Marketing Expert I don't believe that , project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: because whatever companies {disfmarker} they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: So you can {gap} {disfmarker} what shape a person will like . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: So in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers . And by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also . user interface: Uh-huh . But in electronics , I think , it's not q always quite so um {disfmarker} you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: I think , you know , if you're going to buy a T_V_ maybe a company'll have {disfmarker} That you're going to choose from , a company'll have two or three choices , but they're different designs . We were coming up with one product . marketing: Uh maybe . Okay but I will I will personally {disfmarker} won't give it {gap} beyond three . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: No , I mean uh {vocalsound} obviously your opinion , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: I'm just trying to {disfmarker} Okay . marketing: So we can {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} He's a tough cookie . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , maybe . Three or four ? project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh , no sorry , industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: it should be {disfmarker} project manager: Six . Five or six . user interface: What are we doing ? industrial designer: What are we doing ? marketing: No sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , we are doing a very wrong thing . user interface: Adding them up ? industrial designer: We're gonna average them ? marketing: Yeah , yeah , we are taking everything , industrial designer: Okay . So seven fourths . marketing: and that's {disfmarker} I have taken it very wrongly . user interface: Oh . marketing: Yeah uh industrial designer: About one point f one point eight . marketing: three four four two six seven seven sev Yeah one pe exactly . So we can say one or two . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Okay . marketing: {gap} because it is one point eight uh {gap} two , so we will do two . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Oh I see . industrial designer: Yeah round it up to two . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Okay , yeah . industrial designer: So trends . marketing: So where were the trends . industrial designer: Can you explain what you want us to write there ? marketing: Sorry ? industrial designer: How it {disfmarker} how conforms to the current trends ? marketing: Yeah , again the the fashion trends , this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the {vocalsound} uh as a fruit shape or something . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . marketing: Uh . user interface: Well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it um , well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: so I would actually give it a three . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Tha three or four , I'm not sure . marketing: Okay . Yeah . user interface: Three . Go for three . That's fine . marketing: Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: 'Kay . As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it's missing the screen , as we said , um but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons , um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism . So I give it a a four . I'd give it a kinda middle of the road for user interface: Mm . industrial designer: for technology . project manager: Yeah , I am sort of pret uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Just the fruit does me in , I mean uh it might user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: it might be trendy to some , but I'm just not swallowing the fruit , so um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh also uh I would have liked to have seen the L_C_D_ screen in it . Um so yeah I'd say about four as well . marketing: Okay . Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , like , these products are in fruit shape , because that wha people now {disfmarker} our fashion trend shows that people like everything {disfmarker} all f everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them {gap} or showing some association with them . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: So and in this way our product is good . And the second thing , now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: So that is also ef that also {disfmarker} user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market . And yes . It is cus spongy also . So they can play with it , it's quite good . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: So then I think , maybe I can give it two . So four five ten thirteen thirteen {gap} . So we can {disfmarker} Is it fine ? So what about company strategy ? industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: {gap} user interface: Um . industrial designer: Well it was yellow . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , the company strategy , okay . Um {vocalsound} there was lot of discussing , that was good . Um I feel I got my say . Um so I'd give the company strategy a {vocalsound} two . industrial designer: Well , I think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy . marketing: Okay . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Is that the question ? project manager: Yeah , yeah . user interface: Is it ? Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Um . user interface: Okay , so {vocalsound} one or two . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: One . Okay , just leave it , it's fine . industrial designer: I'll go with two . marketing: So what about you , Brian ? project manager: Um yeah , a three . Pretty much kept to the company strategy , so I would go for a {disfmarker} a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . marketing: Yeah , and me also , like , this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe .
