project manager: {vocalsound} Wouldn't wanna be Project Manager . {vocalsound} Uh , what we going to do . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Um , once again I'm uh gonna take minutes . So , um no presentation for me . Uh , first we have a prototype presentation by G_ and G_ . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Afterwards some uh user interface: Yo . marketing: J_ and J_ . {vocalsound} project manager: eval eval evalu industrial designer: Evaluation . project manager: evaluation user interface: Evaluation criteria . marketing: Evaluation . project manager: s {vocalsound} sorry . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh evaluation crit criteria . Uh , in combination with the finance I um {vocalsound} uh I received uh a an uh an Excel uh file user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Hmm . project manager: which we have to fill in later on . Um , you see . Uh , and then we must see uh if we uh stay under the twelve and a half Euro . marketing: Hmm . Interesting . Ah , okay . project manager: So , that's uh that's a big user interface: {vocalsound} Oops . marketing: {vocalsound} Cool . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . That's gonna be t problem . project manager: l so let's uh wait it uh um marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: we have we have must {disfmarker} uh , user interface: Some creative uh {disfmarker} project manager: we must have uh some time for that uh because it will be uh {disfmarker} yeah , quite a lot of mathematics . user interface: Oh . Yeah . project manager: And after that , uh uh an evaluation of uh the process how we uh how we have done it here with the SMARTboard , with the with our laptops , with the {disfmarker} all uh all this . And uh afterwards , uh we closing . Once again , forty minutes , so uh let's start . user interface: Ok okay . project manager: I would g give the word to um G_ and G_ for the prototype presentation . user interface: Shall I give a short introduction and then uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , well sure . marketing: J_ and J_ . project manager: J_ and J_ . user interface: Okay . {vocalsound} J_ and J_ , okay . marketing: Jane and Jane . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: 'Kay guys , take it away . user interface: Take it away . industrial designer: Hi . project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Um , this was our first concept . We decided to use a single touch-screen . So , we've worked out this concepts , how to how to hold it , where to put the buttons and and stuff . And um , well , we began with uh with a form of shape , that is uh is easy to hold w in one hand , left or right handed . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: So , we made i it a little bit less thick and uh it has some ar artistic meaning . No ? This uh isn't nothing . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Idea maybe uh is better . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Um well , during the meeting I showed you the concept of uh placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb , and uh the menu structure , uh if necessary , with your other hand , so it's just gonna hold it easily . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: And it has to be acce accessible with your uh other hand too , of course . project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: So we began uh working out a concept . industrial designer: Yeah , uh well , and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel L_C_D_ uh screen . Well , these would be the main buttons , h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to . But , well it's standard they will be delivered with this kind of uh set-up . We have the {gap} more advanced menu uh setting right here . We have the sub-menus and stu stuff . We made a top {disfmarker} oh , or a front view . Just so like you wanna uh back view . As you can see , this uh {disfmarker} there , there are uh two uh weird bumps in it . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} This is for uh the added uh effect of uh well uh y youth and dynamic . And uh this is for the artistic effect . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well , what we figured is uh we'll show you a picture {gap} later on {gap} you have more b a better idea after that . But , idea is for to stay in balance with these two uh {disfmarker} with these two . marketing: Hmm . industrial designer: And so when you put it on the table , it will just {gap} lay down . It won't {vocalsound} uh roll around or stuff . But it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe , or like these old uh phones . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: Y you you may get the idea . So thi this is about uh how we figured it should be . The s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber layers , like we discussed early on . Uh , you would s you wouldn't see the uh straight panel , but more fluidly and round . user interface: Yeah , the panel just uh of course goes like this . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: But the overlaying layer is uh a little bit uh curved and stuff . project manager: No , okay . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: And uh , in these bumps you could actually uh {gap} put some electronics uh that would {disfmarker} you can make a more thinner uh design , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: and that would actually look very nice , yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: And uh , about the colour , what have {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . Oh , we added that this um can be held with your hands for this {disfmarker} maximum is om yeah , one and a half centimetres . So , you have room here for your battery and maybe even other um electronic chips . S and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some {disfmarker} have some wires underneath it to make it as uh thin as possible in the middle for good grip . marketing: Okay . Hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , f uh , as colours , do you do you have the picture in uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Oh yeah . Now , well this is the idea about uh the bumps . Uh , you can see there's a v a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior . It uh {disfmarker} you just want to hold it you uh you are young and uh dynamic like us . marketing: 'S l {disfmarker} it's like an uh Easter egg . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , it's like an e but this is for children . We we want a more adult version . But , this is like a remote control for children . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: It's called a weemote {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} . A weemote . marketing: Weemote . project manager: Weemote . industrial designer: Yeah . Hey , that's actually a brilliant uh marketing stand . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Wait what I w got in mind . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So this actually basic the idea . We we just want to build a more uh adult vers adult version of of this . project manager: Yeah , I can imagine that . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} And and for colours , we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey . Those are the technological colours actually , user interface: Yeah . It would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable , industrial designer: so it d user interface: so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple , industrial designer: Or blue or whatever . user interface: but when the o older people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one . And young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible , marketing: Hmm . user interface: they think , ah I'll buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip uh {disfmarker} marketing: Hmm . Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop . user interface: Well , um I think a cover is necessary , 'cause als otherwise you'll just have the L_C_D_ screen . marketing: Yeah , okay . Yeah , okay . user interface: So , there must be some cheap standard cover , um maybe white or something , marketing: Hmm . Mm . user interface: that's could comes with it and you can buy , so we can make extra money . project manager: Yeah , but uh you d you mustn't forget that uh our target aim is younger people . marketing: Oui okay . project manager: Uh , we had decided to uh put uh some flashy fruity colours in it , uh and uh in the survey from uh Milan and Paris uh it uh it came out that uh uh the d the older people are uh more willing to uh to spend money on extra features . So I think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard , user interface: Okay . The other way around , you mean . industrial designer: {gap} Oh yeah . project manager: and for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated , more traditional look , they're willing to pay uh that . user interface: Uh-huh . project manager: They want uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they want more luxury stuff , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: but they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: So , maybe it's an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard . user interface: Okay . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah , maybe {disfmarker} yeah , perhaps you're right . Uh , I I would I would actually agree with this sounds logical . user interface: Okay , yeah . marketing: An another idea . Uh , maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style . project manager: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} They'll please the elder users as well . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Well yeah , a colour of {disfmarker} a wood style , a white c and uh a couple of h hip uh fruity colours . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: And lea uh l delivered standard with a fruity colour , but not too not too much . industrial designer: Nah . Yeah . marketing: Yes . Not not too uh {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: This is banana and mango , not not purple or p orange and yellow . marketing: Yeah , exactly . project manager: Yeah . But , the mai I think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours . marketing: Yeah . Or blue or {disfmarker} project manager: Not too , but w a little , user interface: Ah . Mm-hmm . project manager: because that's our aim . industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: li like like this like this . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: This isn't this isn't too much , is it ? user interface: Yeah , okay . No . Yeah . industrial designer: I f marketing: {gap} . project manager: Well , the buttons don't have to be uh all uh all of {gap} industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} The buttons , marketing: Well I I I think so . industrial designer: I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , except for the buttons it's {disfmarker} it could be a standard model . project manager: yeah . It {disfmarker} Yeah . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah , uh something like this would be nice . project manager: Okay . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Okay , that's that's it from us . project manager: Thank you . marketing: 'Kay , it's my time now . user interface: It's my turn . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: The Marketing Expert . industrial designer: Uh-oh . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: During the {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Oh . {vocalsound} During the design uh design life-cycle we uh project manager: {vocalsound} Sorry . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and stuff . Um , now is the time to uh evaluate our prototype concept to uh to the past requirements . {vocalsound} So we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis . Um , we're going to do that with a seven point scale . Opening a Word document now . Okay . One {disfmarker} oh , okay , uh I have to expla explain something . We have to uh be consensive about about things . So , it has to be a group uh group decision . project manager: Okay , marketing: Okay ? project manager: so we gon we gonna evaluate the marketing: Uh {disfmarker} We're going to vote . We {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , the the thing we {gap} saw . marketing: yeah ? The prototype . project manager: Okay , just saw . marketing: Yeah . Okay , one . The remote control is designed for people with age below forty . project manager: Yeah . Seven ? marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Seven is false . project manager: Uh , true . {vocalsound} Sorry . marketing: Yeah , b one or {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , one I think . industrial designer: Why ? marketing: Most true ? industrial designer: Yeah , it's not just uh designed for people under the age of forty . It's also designed for people above forty . user interface: Mm . marketing: Yeah , project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: so {disfmarker} industrial designer: So {disfmarker} marketing: so a o one is appropriate ? user interface: No no , a little more in the middle . marketing: Or , more like a four . user interface: No , uh three or {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: I have {disfmarker} I've {disfmarker} marketing: Three . industrial designer: Yeah , two or three , because it's not just {disfmarker} uh the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: But it's also designed for people of age above forty . So , marketing: Ah , exactly . Exactly . industrial designer: I'll say it's about three . user interface: Yeah , project manager: Okay . user interface: it will be primary appealing to to m minus forty , but also appealing to {disfmarker} marketing: Three . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . But also for {disfmarker} yeah , okay . Uh , second . The remote control is beautiful . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Wow . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , acco according to us , it's one ? Or {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , I I think {disfmarker} user interface: it's the marketing uh angle on television . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , user interface: We have a wonderful {disfmarker} marketing: p s Of c of course you have to be uh very positive and uh enthusiastic about your own product . user interface: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Well , it's also fancy then . marketing: Three . Uh , the remote control looks fancy . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes . user interface: Yeah . marketing: One ? project manager: Yep . user interface: Of course . We have a perfect remote . industrial designer: Yes . marketing: Good . Four . The remote control has big , clear channel switching buttons . user interface: Yes . Yeah yeah , oh they have to agree but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Yes . industrial designer: Leads to user face , yeah . user interface: I'm the User Interface uh Expert . {vocalsound} marketing: Daniel . Uh , teletext buttons and volume buttons ? user interface: Um , uh no . project manager: No teletext buttons . Teletext is in the menu . user interface: You you've different menu . industrial designer: Yeah , false . marketing: False ? user interface: And volume is impo marketing: And volume ? project manager: Volume is true . user interface: yeah . marketing: True . industrial designer: Uh , hmm . marketing: Big and clear ? project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , the they are big and clear . {gap} . user interface: Yeah yeah , big and clear . project manager: Yeah , big and clear . user interface: But you could make a teletext button uh six . marketing: Hey . user interface: Otherwise , the people who read this uh are gonna think we have no teletext button . marketing: Hey . Hide . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , but but the teletext button . Yeah , you can ch That's in a menu . marketing: {vocalsound} It's it's not {disfmarker} industrial designer: So , it's w yeah , it {disfmarker} it it marketing: yeah , it {disfmarker} industrial designer: it isn't entirely unclear , marketing: J industrial designer: but {disfmarker} So , I wouldn't give it a seven . user interface: No . industrial designer: I would give it a more a five or a six . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Five ? industrial designer: Uh , I don I don't know . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: What do you think , uh Mister Project Manager ? marketing: Yeah , it's it's {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: Oh , okay . Well , I agree . I was thinking very black and white . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: Black and red . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Thank you J_ . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Okay , don't forget to save it . Uh {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Red . Okay . Volume . The remote control is easy to be found . user interface: Uh well , when we put in fancy colours , yeah project manager: {vocalsound} Fruity . {vocalsound} user interface: and {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , it has these {disfmarker} all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: So , if you so if you have {vocalsound} trouble finding it {disfmarker} user interface: But , um it it's not making any sound uh , marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: have we deciding ? marketing: Oh , okay , user interface: So {disfmarker} marketing: but {disfmarker} If you put uh your normal uh remote control under your bed , or you throw this remote control under your bed , is it better findable ? user interface: {vocalsound} It'll make a difference . We have the better re {vocalsound} I don't know . Yeah , I think so . My remote control's black . marketing: A li little bit maybe ? user interface: A little bit , but {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: Yeah . Well , we p we can do it glow in the dark . marketing: Four ? user interface: Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Fi project manager: So , if it's in the dark place , you still see it glowing . user interface: {vocalsound} K yeah . marketing: I {disfmarker} user interface: Fo fo yeah fo five is {gap} . marketing: Ah , I I I think five . It's it's {disfmarker} it doesn't really make a lot of {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well , then uh then I'll go for four . marketing: Four ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Because uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false . user interface: Yeah , okay , you're right . industrial designer: Uh , marketing: {vocalsound} Yes , but five is between four and six . {vocalsound} project manager: I think {disfmarker} industrial designer: so I'll I'll go for four . project manager: Ah , you must see it as uh , w uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls , there may uh uh be there in your uh T_V_ room , this one will stand out , I think . industrial designer: Wha user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: B_ . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , that that's a better question actually . marketing: Yeah , project manager: Exa I think that that's what it's about . user interface: Yeah . marketing: it {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} user interface: If your uh fifteen remotes in a drawer , uh you find it , yeah ? project manager: If it {disfmarker} if this lying on your couch , you're you're {disfmarker} you think what's that for kinda orange uh thing . marketing: Yeah , yeah . project manager: So {disfmarker} marketing: But but the survey under users was that they uh really lost it . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , that's stupid . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Like , no not uh not seeing it , but lost it in the house or something . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . user interface: Uh , but when you lost it you're just not {disfmarker} marketing: But , okay . industrial designer: Well , if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere , uh then you'd uh recognise it as , whoa , that is strange . project manager: {vocalsound} That's our remote control . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , mostly when you lose your remote control , it it's under your {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , okay . Yeah , I I agree , I agree . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah , what is that . Uh , user interface: Most of times when you lose it you're sitting on it . Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: so it's {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . Eight , the remote control has fresh , fruity colours . project manager: True . {vocalsound} user interface: Um I would call uh {disfmarker} choose two , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: 'cause we decided not to make two f uh fresh colours , as it would not {gap} . marketing: Yeah , yeah , not too flashy . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: The remote control is made of soft material . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Um , industrial designer: Yeah , rubber , is kind of soft . project manager: Yeah , but not too soft we have decided . user interface: kinda soft , but but not this {gap} . Yeah . marketing: Three ? project manager: Three , yeah . user interface: Yeah . Yeah yeah , easy to use , project manager: Easy to use . One . user interface: {vocalsound} very afford . marketing: Easy to use ? project manager: Yeah , can it be zero ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well , {vocalsound} I don yeah , it is kind of {disfmarker} marketing: Top easy to use ? industrial designer: It {disfmarker} marketing: It's it's not the most easy to use {disfmarker} user interface: No , you can do two , because um industrial designer: No . Uh {disfmarker} marketing: It can be easier . user interface: it can be easier . But then you're l industrial designer: It could {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: Jus just with ten buttons , that's the easiest . user interface: yeah , but then you'll lose {gap} project manager: Yeah . user interface: function f yeah , functionality and our fancy uh look , so . industrial designer: Functional ability . marketing: Yeah , but the most uh easy to use is just with one button user interface: But {disfmarker} It is r it is rather easy to use , because you have the primary buttons always visible . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: on t {vocalsound} Yeah , okay , but easy n not not the most easy to use , I think . user interface: {gap} industrial designer: {gap} . user interface: No . industrial designer: No , it's it {disfmarker} I I'll go for two . My vote's on two . {vocalsound} marketing: Two ? project manager: Okay , two . Yeah , two . user interface: Yeah , m mine too . marketing: We also have to compare it to the uh to the remote controls on the market nowadays . So {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , but waits just a minutes . Inspiration . project manager: What's the time ? We also have uh to do the evaluation , uh the production costs and uh stuff . user interface: These are the m regular remotes . marketing: Yeah yeah , I'm uh hurrying . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay , eleven . The remote control is innovative . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yes , true , one . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: You're agree , Tim ? marketing: A very {disfmarker} of course . project manager: You haven't seen a more innovative uh thing in uh Paris ? {vocalsound} marketing: The remote control has m remova {vocalsound} removable {gap} from Multilux . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yes , one . Very multifunctional . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: No . marketing: The remote control , i it has speech recognition . project manager: False . industrial designer: Yes , marketing: False . industrial designer: it {disfmarker} user interface: This is used with speech recognition , this . marketing: The remote control has built-in games ? project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yes . But uh , maybe make it two , because the games are in a sub-menu and not uh {disfmarker} it's not an entire game . project manager: Yeah , but they are built in , so it's one . industrial designer: Yeah , they are built in . user interface: Yeah , okay . marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {gap} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Not down . marketing: And the last , paren {vocalsound} parental advisory function . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} You really like the parental advisory . {vocalsound} user interface: Yes . project manager: Freak . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yes , {vocalsound} I do . user interface: Th did you make this or the {disfmarker} industrial designer: Bu marketing: Save as . industrial designer: Yeah , he made it . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} It changes it maybe . marketing: Okay , I will uh user interface: Oh yay . marketing: do the the math . user interface: Oh dear . marketing: Now it's your turn . project manager: Okay , thank you . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} We'll see . user interface: Hmm ? project manager: Mm . Okay , we have now to c uh to calculate the production cost . If it's under uh twelve and half Euro , then it's uh ok uh okay . But i is it {disfmarker} if it is b Huh ? No , this isn't right . Okay so , {gap} . Redesign . user interface: If they're under twelve fifty . project manager: Oh yeah , if they under {disfmarker} Yeah . No . Oh yeah . Yeah , it's {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah ? Cau 'cause {disfmarker} so it's okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: sorry . Yeah , if the costs are under twelve and a half Euro , uh then we uh can uh ra uh move on to the project evaluation , as we have uh experienced it . Otherwise , we have uh do uh have to do a little uh redesign uh thingy . So {disfmarker} Uh , we have to fill in the numbers of the component uh components . We have to uh fil uh , want to uh do it in and uh see uh if we stay under the twelve and a half Euro . So , do we have uh a hand dynamo ? No . industrial designer: No . project manager: That's zero . industrial designer: Me , too . user interface: Battery , yes . One . project manager: Battery , one ? industrial designer: Yes . user interface: One , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay . Kinetic , one ? user interface: Kinetic , one . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: Okay , solar cells , zero . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay , uh simple chip on print ? industrial designer: Uh , n no . marketing: No . project manager: No ? No , advanced chip . user interface: No . industrial designer: No . marketing: Advanced chip . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Sample sensor sample speaker ? user interface: No , the advanced chip is uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: No . marketing: Advanced chip is three . project manager: Three ? marketing: Three Euros , yep . project manager: Yeah uh , but it it's one one thing , it's three Euro . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Uh , we have one . We have one {disfmarker} marketing: Okay , one piece , yeah . industrial designer: {gap} . project manager: Uh , what's the sample sensor ? industrial designer: No , sev zero . marketing: No . industrial designer: Well , that's um {disfmarker} marketing: Speech recognition , I think . user interface: Yeah , you give it a sample , uh one . industrial designer: yeah , speech recognition project manager: Okay . industrial designer: and s project manager: Zero . Uh , uncurved flat . user interface: No . project manager: No . industrial designer: A zero . marketing: No . project manager: But is it s it's not made from a single uncurved thingy and then uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and then uh {disfmarker} user interface: You {disfmarker} no . marketing: No . industrial designer: No . No . marketing: Thingy . {vocalsound} project manager: no ? Okay . {vocalsound} So it's only uh once double-curved . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , marketing: Yes , user interface: 'cause um the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the o on the uh the back of the {disfmarker} marketing: three . Eight . project manager: Okay . We're now in a problem , 'cause uh we have uh reached eleven Euro yet . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Uh , we don't have anything else . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay , go on . Just go on . project manager: Okay , but uh we have {disfmarker} industrial designer: Just go on . Then we'll see uh {disfmarker} we'll we'll see uh wha how much we are over budget . project manager: Okay . user interface: Could you step a little to the right ma marketing: Two . user interface: Yeah . Oh , sorry . marketing: Two . project manager: Uh , rubber . user interface: Or {disfmarker} project manager: You . industrial designer: Zero . project manager: Titanium , no ? {vocalsound} user interface: And zero . Special uh {disfmarker} is the special colour ? project manager: Special colour ? user interface: Mm . industrial designer: I don't think so . No , this is a standard colour . marketing: No . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , but we want to make uh the wood colours , uh that uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} S industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yes , this is a special colour . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , if if you're honest , we'll uh type one , special colour . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , but but D but Daniel , tha that's that's another brand . industrial designer: {vocalsound} That's an add-on . project manager: Yeah , one . marketing: That's another article to sell . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but we we going to {disfmarker} yeah yeah , that's true . But yeah , it's it's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} user interface: Uh , j maybe we'll finish uh the the list first and then look back , aye ? marketing: That doesn't account for this . Producing this . project manager: Okay , the push-button , no . user interface: No . Scroll wheel , no . project manager: Scroll-wheel , no . user interface: {gap} {disfmarker} No . project manager: No . Oh , no . Yes , one . user interface: {gap} {disfmarker} project manager: Uh , button , no . user interface: One , yeah . project manager: No , the the {disfmarker} user interface: No . industrial designer: No . user interface: Mm , is it {disfmarker} project manager: we don't have a s user interface: No . No . industrial designer: These three . project manager: no . Okay . industrial designer: Well , we're only four Euro over budget . marketing: No . project manager: Oh , okay . So , um what's the thing we can change ? user interface: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: But {disfmarker} user interface: No . No . industrial designer: Well , other case , we can make it single-curved or uncurved . project manager: Uh , can I uh I say something ? user interface: Mm , single-curves . marketing: Yeah . project manager: No , can I say something uh as Project Manager ? marketing: Yeah , of course . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . project manager: The kinetic thing , can we just skip it , user interface: Just cut off the kine yeah . project manager: because uh you have to shake it , but that's not really innovative . user interface: Or {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . Okay , sure . user interface: yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah , we just put a good battery it it . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Mobile phones nowadays . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Daniel . Daniel , project manager: Yo . Sorry , marketing: what do you think about {disfmarker} Here . project manager: yeah , yes . {vocalsound} marketing: What do you think about uh putting a battery in it , but also selling like uh the covers , a docking station project manager: Yeah . marketing: just apart from the from the thing , so that you can uh put uh project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: {vocalsound} rechargeable batteries in it and just {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . user interface: But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual . project manager: Yeah , and not really {gap} . marketing: Yeah , yeah , okay . project manager: But we {disfmarker} if you forget about the kinetic , marketing: Just an idea . user interface: Yeah , that's a cost reduc industrial designer: Yeah , sure . marketing: Yeah . project manager: well if we do that , we shall {gap} . user interface: Ah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay , project manager: So um {disfmarker} industrial designer: well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved . marketing: Yeah , of course . industrial designer: And that would solve the budget problem . project manager: Uh , b but i but the single-curved is just {disfmarker} oh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: No , it's it's just one curve and not a back uh curved I think . Or {disfmarker} industrial designer: It's just {disfmarker} yeah well , the single-curve that {disfmarker} project manager: Oh , okay , okay . industrial designer: Yeah . Exactly , yeah . project manager: So that's wh tha that's one option . user interface: {vocalsound} Or are these two curves ? Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: And then w yeah , and then we could have it , but uh {disfmarker} it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look . marketing: Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , but what else uh do we have to cut out ? No advanced chip , uh that's a little bit of problem . industrial designer: We going to cut {disfmarker} project manager: No , tho uh that that can be done . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So uh , user interface: Although , can we make it with a regular chip ? project manager: okay , a little less uh conversation . user interface: Curvy . marketing: Hey , those ar arcs , why are there for ? project manager: Sorry ? marketing: The blue blue uh project manager: Fill in {gap} {disfmarker} Just a user interface: Explanation . marketing: Okay . project manager: explanation . user interface: Twelve fifty . project manager: I can delete it for you if you want . user interface: Well {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: No , no no . project manager: So , if we do this , uh we're on uh twelve and a half Euro . And we're done . user interface: Yeah , but does it fit with our design ? project manager: {vocalsound} Uh well , the only uh thing that don't {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Do we have to u adapt it ? It's single-curves . project manager: Yeah , single-curved , but there's a curve in it . So {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: W Could we just make the bubbles uh cut off the back , and then we're uh has {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , we just make it flat . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: But , you do l marketing: But , wha 'Kay , look , what is the uh {disfmarker} If you make it double-curved , it costs one Euro more . user interface: More . Yeah . You make it optional . marketing: But {disfmarker} No , but does it have a lot of extra uh {gap} industrial designer: Function . user interface: Functional . marketing: fun function more like {disfmarker} industrial designer: Worth , does it have added worth ? user interface: Uh , there's an a a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: No , um {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , it's really a static value . Yeah . marketing: Yeah , uh aesthetic . I mean , uh you make like eleven and a half Euros profit instead of twelve and a half . But {disfmarker} I don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price . project manager: Yeah , it is . Oh . industrial designer: Yeah , well let's assume it is . marketing: No , we can't go above that . industrial designer: We we should assume it i that it is . marketing: Yeah ? project manager: Yeah , okay . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion . marketing: Yeah , okay . Then it's okay . industrial designer: R if you uh promote a kinetic um {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} kinetic remote control , I mean , that would b sell better than an {disfmarker} a normal remote control . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Do you think ? Well , now you can shake your remote {gap} control . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , I think so . industrial designer: No , well , y I mean uh , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k uh remote control is kinetic . project manager: {vocalsound} Kinetic . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: You have standard old battery control uh remote con marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: What a what about all the m the environment freaks ? user interface: Yeah , but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile . So {disfmarker} marketing: Not freaks , industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: the envi No . industrial designer: True . marketing: I I think it's it's {disfmarker} It look like this one . user interface: You ma can make an an especialised extra gold version . project manager: Yeah ? Who {disfmarker} because if you want to go to kinetic , you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: and I think now it's it's more of uh a compromise user interface: Yeah . project manager: thing . marketing: Yeah . project manager: And if you make the single curve ha just a big curve , {vocalsound} then it's uh then it's uh {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , just one big curve . {vocalsound} project manager: yeah , one big good curve . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} I was going to uh say nasty words , but I don't . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: This is strange by the way . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Wood is m is is is cheaper than rubber . We thought that wood would be more expensive . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Uh , this uh American figures . You just cut down some trees . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , maybe . But uh that {disfmarker} this is this is it ? Yeah . Okay , this is it . marketing: This is it . user interface: Whoever makes uh a remote control out of titanium . project manager: I'm gonna save it . Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} Yes . {vocalsound} industrial designer: It is possible , but you can't use double uh curves for titanium . user interface: No . industrial designer: That's one of the functionability uh {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , well , considering we have {disfmarker} marketing: Ah no , we have to do all those hours again . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Go back . One back ? Costs on uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No redesign . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Well , we were above , so we did a little redesign {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: We sue . {vocalsound} We {vocalsound} Yeah , we'll start her all o all over again . marketing: Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} okay , yeah . project manager: Okay , um now uh it's about time to uh talk about uh this project . Uh , some uh things . Were there uh room for uh {disfmarker} was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ? user interface: Um {disfmarker} marketing: Hmm . I I didn't think so . That {disfmarker} there was a lot of room for it . But , that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us . project manager: Yeah . marketing: It was just fixed information and get your stuff from there , and I couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff . Bu project manager: Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . That's true . I agree with that . industrial designer: Well , I th I think you two , {vocalsound} uh especially you and uh and uh Daniel , you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project . project manager: Yeah . That's true . marketing: Yeah . user interface: For us , there was a lot of creativity . industrial designer: 'Cause I think m user interface: We could just sign up an uh remote if we liked . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , that's true . industrial designer: I think Jeroen and I , we had a more design {disfmarker} we could have more {disfmarker} we had more room for creativity than than you two . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . Yeah , that's true . project manager: Okay . Uh how about the leadership ? {vocalsound} user interface: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Ha . marketing: Leadership was uh crappy . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Crappy . {vocalsound} Cra industrial designer: {vocalsound} Nah , the leadership wasn't crappy , it was the leader that was crappy . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay , thank you very much . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Nah . No , the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} leadership was okay . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Now we're done . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , example of crappy leadershi marketing: No , leadership was uh user interface: Okay , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , it was good . marketing: {vocalsound} Okay , I thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting . project manager: Yeah , that's true . marketing: Uh , you could have {disfmarker} but uh , it was your first , no uh no disrespect or something , project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more . project manager: Yeah . marketing: So like , I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting , and {disfmarker} user interface: You could of said , shut up you fool . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . I notice it too . marketing: But {disfmarker} project manager: I was a I was also very uh unhappy , uh very unsatisfied uh about the marketing: About me . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} {gap} about the first meeting . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: So , uh I hope uh uh the the the other meetings uh industrial designer: Try to learn from your mistake . {vocalsound} And we will never do it again . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , you made up . {vocalsound} project manager: get better and uh I think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk {disfmarker} marketing: No , it {disfmarker} you did better . user interface: Yeah , more more consensus . project manager: yeah . user interface: Ev everybody w was agreeing every {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . Much more constructive . project manager: Okay , so uh that's cool . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Uh , teamwork ? Well , maybe that's uh only {disfmarker} Yeah well , it's for us , because uh {disfmarker} user interface: Well , we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task . project manager: Yeah . Yeah and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed . user interface: So , it is a little bit {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: But , really teamwork were you two uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . No {disfmarker} Well , it went okay . marketing: Two guys . project manager: The {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , that went w it went well . project manager: Yeah ? industrial designer: It's it's just uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Stupid stupid pen , but uh {disfmarker} project manager: No hard feelings . industrial designer: Nah . Yeah , we we had some trouble with the pen , but {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Now you you must push a little while . user interface: Yeah , but but draw something uh difficult . industrial designer: Yeah , but us {disfmarker} user interface: D uh just write your name right now . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Try to write your name , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: {gap} user interface: in in writing letters , of course , yeah ? Yeah , normally , uh this uh {disfmarker} the w Block letter sign it , yeah ? project manager: O Just uh {disfmarker} user interface: Just just write your name in in one line . project manager: okay . user interface: If it's a little bit too small {disfmarker} {gap} bit quicker now . project manager: You can be {disfmarker} you can go quicker , 'cause then it it won't notice it . user interface: It didn't {disfmarker} Uh he he knows how it works , yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Oh . project manager: I follow the Master class for the SMARTboard , so I think that's the that's the main issue . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} Um , so uh about this one you were uh you're dealing with , marketing: Means . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: um the the the the digital pen . user interface: Y well , yeah . Th the i The idea is great , but it doesn't work properly . Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . Yeah . marketing: Digital pen , I thought uh th the first time I did individual work , I used it . project manager: Yeah . marketing: But , a and the first two meetings I brought it with me , but I didn't use it at all after the first the first meeting . project manager: No . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: No , I have it working . But , uh yeah , well uh {disfmarker} marketing: It's it's not real real use for me . industrial designer: No , it doesn't have that much added value to the {disfmarker} project manager: Huh . Well {disfmarker} user interface: Nee . As uh as I said a m a c few moments ago , it {disfmarker} I would like , myself , to write with a normal pen , because must um {disfmarker} Yeah , it's almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner . project manager: Yeah . user interface: I it's the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow . project manager: M yeah . Yeah . And it is still your own handwriting uh popping up in uh Word . user interface: Yes . No , and it doesn't give any added value . project manager: No , uh that's true . No . marketing: Not really , no . project manager: And uh the SMARTboard is uh useful , but the the pen is I uh {gap} {disfmarker} not user-friendly , I think . user interface: Yeah , not user-friendly . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things , marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , and it's it's not very precise . project manager: and that's the {disfmarker} user interface: We're trying to m to {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , like when you do this . user interface: Yeah , it may um {disfmarker} Yeah , and tr try to wri write your name uh in a in a normal uh size , yeah . Smaller . marketing: Smaller ? user interface: Yeah , smaller . Just like when you're writing on a letter . project manager: Yeah , but that's not th the the {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} when you {gap} at a foreign audience , you b don't gonna wr uh write uh small . user interface: No , a as you saw on on this drawing , just open open this one or that one . It's uh th it it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , uh we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons , it's almost impossible to get clear uh {gap} when you're uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . marketing: Oh . Sorry . project manager: But maybe there's some function with {disfmarker} no , it isn't . With uh {disfmarker} user interface: And the eraser was another problem . It w t is is this large . {vocalsound} And when you try to erase this line , y {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . Well , I'm gonna erase my uh name . {vocalsound} user interface: I'm gonna erase my name there . project manager: Yeah , it's a big uh big eraser . marketing: Okay . New ideas ? user interface: M Abo What kind of new ideas ? project manager: Um {disfmarker} Well , the the idea of the touch-screen is uh {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Do you ? user interface: Yeah , uh {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Go on . {vocalsound} project manager: I'm just uh {disfmarker} user interface: New ideas about uh the working of this software , about about the project , about the remote controls or {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . Mm , yeah , I think so . project manager: I don't know what what I mean . {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} No . user interface: Hello . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Did you heard what he said ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Know what I mean . {vocalsound} marketing: I don't {vocalsound} I don't know what I mean . {vocalsound} Oh , I have some figure . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Here . project manager: {vocalsound} Oh . marketing: The eva the evaluation , project manager: Oh yeah . marketing: the mm the mean uh number is uh one point eight one point eight six . project manager: That's interesting . marketing: So that's fairly uh fairly good , I think . project manager: Okay , user interface: Yeah . project manager: because what does it mean ? user interface: So true . marketing: Uh , that uh project manager: All the mo yeah , are between one and two . marketing: all the requirements uh are true or very true , right . Yep . project manager: Yeah . Oh , okay . Yeah , okay . Thank you , expert . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} But the new ideas found for uh wi with working with this uh software ? user interface: Not really , just they have to improve it . project manager: Not really , yeah ? user interface: Uh , the concept is okay , project manager: Yeah , I think {disfmarker} user interface: but it has to be quicker . Uh , it is still opening my programme , n almo almost uh my entire computer is locked up during the process project manager: Yeah . user interface: and it , yeah , just takes too many time . People will still feel the need to to write it quickly on uh a page and not download it and save it , and {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . You had expected it to to be uh more more uh {disfmarker} user interface: More user-friendly . project manager: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} 'Cause when you use a pen , you can just draw like you d draw normally , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: and you do marketing: May maybe the idea you proposed is uh a screen here . user interface: Yeah . marketing: And draw it , and it's it's placed over there . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , that l project manager: Yeah . user interface: Would be easier . Or at least when you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you don't have to adapt to the technology , just you can write in the way you normally write . And now you have to um keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen . marketing: Hmm ? No . user interface: And that's a very bad concept . project manager: Yep , yep . Yeah , that's true . marketing: Ah , very bad . user interface: Nah , okay , I I {disfmarker} it's my opinion that I {disfmarker} marketing: But {disfmarker} I think this is better than regular flip-overs , but {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , it's can be saved easier . marketing: Yeah . user interface: But if you're in normal flip-over {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} a lot of people write text . There's no text option . marketing: Yeah . user interface: And writing text {disfmarker} uh , yeah , you've gotta really do your best to write some {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , and and maybe some uh functions for uh {vocalsound} uh uh circle or uh a square . You have to draw it yourself now . user interface: Yeah . Or maybe even insert picture . marketing: Yeah . user interface: If you have uh some presentation , and you have some f project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Or text function . Just t t type text , and that that would be uh excellent . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Mean {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , but insert image isn't available ? user interface: {vocalsound} 'Cause then you could {disfmarker} marketing: Here . Picture from scanner , clip-art . project manager: Yeah , that that can be done already . user interface: Oh , okay . project manager: But not the the the the predefined uh squares I think uh {disfmarker} user interface: So you can {disfmarker} marketing: Hyperlink ? Hey , what if you do like hyperlink ? user interface: With uh W_W_ dot Google dot com . marketing: Type type it ? user interface: Oh yeah . Maybe {gap} . marketing: Re Real Reaction dot N_L_ . project manager: Hmm ? Sorry ? marketing: Yes , is {disfmarker} now is okay . Okay ? user interface: You'll just make a link in {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Huh . project manager: Well , that's nice . user interface: There's one way to uh {disfmarker} project manager: Is it {disfmarker} marketing: 'Kay , double-click it . user interface: Maybe if if you're not using the eraser {disfmarker} project manager: Here . oh . Oh , sorry . marketing: You're erasing . user interface: Something else th Yeah , arrow . project manager: Yeah . Here , that . marketing: Double-click it . user interface: Okay . project manager: So you have {disfmarker} user interface: Well , it's {disfmarker} project manager: as you saw , you have a little uh {disfmarker} Oh , you can {disfmarker} Yeah , thank you . You can go uh user interface: Yeah , okay . project manager: there . So there the the the functionality is there , but it's not it's not ideal , user interface: But {disfmarker} project manager: and it's it's very {disfmarker} user interface: {gap} . project manager: it costs a lot of time to uh user interface: To use , yeah . project manager: to use . And that's a pity , marketing: Yeah . project manager: if you uh if you have uh thirty , forty minutes uh for this kind of things , user interface: Yeah . project manager: and we are now with four people , user interface: And that's m project manager: but it {disfmarker} well , imagine you are here {disfmarker} you're with the ten people and everyone uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} That's mostly the case , from the {disfmarker} over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case , project manager: Yeah . user interface: and if you have to do all this kind {disfmarker} project manager: Two minutes of drawing , yeah . user interface: You'll rather use PowerPoint and work it out in advance . marketing: Yep . project manager: Yeah . user interface: And th the one or two things you have to draw when you're there , just use a flip-board . project manager: Yeah . marketing: What I really miss also is uh industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} is a d is a turtle {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: is a decision uh decision system like um {disfmarker} With the evaluation , you have to Polls like , what do you want , a one , a two , project manager: Yeah yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: maybe a a l a little application like uh uh {vocalsound} give your own number and click one two three four five six seven . project manager: Yeah , just like he said with the with the {disfmarker} a screen which you can write , also uh a kind of voting uh mechanism . marketing: Yeah , j ju ju yeah , v voting application . industrial designer: Oh . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Just a little group group decision application . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: But uh , {gap} problem is , well you can't discuss anything {disfmarker} well you you ca uh you can , but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now . We {disfmarker} I mean uh w w w one one person s maybe said three . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: But , well uh I {disfmarker} we said {disfmarker} uh , no I w th think two , because this and this , and then you can react uh on it . marketing: Yeah , okay . industrial designer: But if you you put a three on it , uh just {vocalsound} figure well , everybody knows what I'm knowing , so they'll all just put a two on . marketing: Yeah , of course . But , uh you can still discuss about it , industrial designer: Yeah , but it would {disfmarker} {gap} yeah . marketing: but but click it in an application , that's a lot easier to process . industrial designer: Yeah okay , the {disfmarker} for processing part . marketing: {vocalsound} The digit . Yeah . industrial designer: But then uh , I think the idea of one person entering it and the rest uh discussing it , that uh isn't that bad idea , actually . project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Not that your opinion isn't valued , but but still . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . Okay , so {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . marketing: Okay . user interface: Yo , manager . marketing: That's it ? project manager: Uh well , just about , user interface: When are w industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: because uh marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: When are we going to produce it ? project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , tomorrow ? Uh , the costs are within the budget . marketing: Celebration . project manager: Uh , the project is evaluated . marketing: Yeah . project manager: But , before we going to celebrate , uh I have uh a little question which you can't answer , marketing: Yeah . project manager: because uh there must be some kind of end report . I am busy with the end report right now . You might thinking what the hell was he doing uh {disfmarker} marketing: What is an end report ? project manager: Uh about all the meetings , what we have decided , a r r a report of this day . marketing: Yeah . Yeah , yeah . project manager: Uh , that must be made , but I don't know , {vocalsound} here is uh standing uh whoa , we can celebrate now , but the end report is {disfmarker} marketing: Oh , you ha you have ten minutes left , I uh read . user interface: Oh . marketing: You have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report . project manager: Okay well , that uh that can be done . Maybe we can do it uh together . You can see what I've uh {disfmarker} yeah ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: So I I s I will uh put it on a story-board . industrial designer: Yeah , sure . project manager: You can see it . Because I think it will uh it must be uh {disfmarker} marketing: Um {disfmarker} You you already made a beta version , or {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , it's a three uh {gap} with seventy five uh {disfmarker} marketing: Pages . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , just about . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Y yikes . {vocalsound} Seventy five pages . project manager: Well , just a moment . End report . marketing: Okay , Daniel . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Do you want a chair maybe ? user interface: A chairman . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: No no no , marketing: Hey ? project manager: I'm just uh {disfmarker} marketing: Oh , okay . project manager: you can s you can read it and uh {disfmarker} here here it is . End report . industrial designer: So you you finished it actually , and so we just have to read it and say yes or no ? project manager: Well , this not nit it {disfmarker} user interface: Yes . {vocalsound} project manager: read-only . But it's not uh fully finished yet . marketing: Five minutes for finishing . project manager: Um , this is about the functional design , the things {disfmarker} yeah yeah . marketing: Management Expert , you have to change that . project manager: Oh yeah . I'm uh {disfmarker} when I said it , I remember I had it here . marketing: Marketing . user interface: It's a read-only version . marketing: Yeah , but you can save it u the {disfmarker} under another name . user interface: Oh , okay . project manager: Marketing Expert , okay . Um about the three functions where {disfmarker} uh which are most used and uh which must uh immediately be visible on our uh remote control . Um , it must be uh simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people . So , this is really about wh uh what kind things uh must be in it and uh {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: Maybe um the {disfmarker} {gap} {vocalsound} user interface: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , I understand you , I can talk a little bit Dutch . {vocalsound} marketing: The {disfmarker} Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: You {disfmarker} Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: No , you have to put {disfmarker} uh , switch channels uh at the top , because that's the most used function and teletext at the second {disfmarker} project manager: Oka okay , okay , I {disfmarker} I really {vocalsound} didn't knew that . marketing: Oh nay , a volume changing , second . project manager: So , this one's first . marketing: S switch , yes . project manager: You go there and you go there . So , okay . marketing: Yeah .
