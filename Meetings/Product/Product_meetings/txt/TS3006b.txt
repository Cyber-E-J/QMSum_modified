industrial designer: {gap} . user interface: Hello {vocalsound} . 'Kay . project manager: You all saw the newsflash ? industrial designer: It's {disfmarker} project manager: Or you got the same message ? marketing: Yeah I I just saw it one minute ago . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah sorry . industrial designer: I don't know . marketing: When I uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: I didn't see it yet I think . user interface: Newsflash ? D did I miss something ? marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Yeah . Yeah I received an email so I thought I I can't mail you so I thought I'd just drop it in the folder , but {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah pretty much . industrial designer: Hey what's wrong with my computer ? user interface: Okay . project manager: Is it unlocked ? user interface: No . industrial designer: {gap} . marketing: Mm . Yeah that's my presentation . {vocalsound} project manager: Woah . I uh kind of opened it {gap} . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Huh ? marketing: Mm ? project manager: Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: What the {disfmarker} marketing: Oh right . user interface: I think you have to uh change your desktop uh project manager: Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: size . marketing: Ooh . {vocalsound} project manager: 'Kay . Everybody ready ? industrial designer: Not really . marketing: Well {disfmarker} industrial designer: Sorry . project manager: No no no . Yes yes yes . user interface: {gap} computer is uh not functioning ? marketing: Alright . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: Okay . Where do I find this ? I'm not so g display huh ? user interface: Uh display . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: And then uh settings ? industrial designer: Appearance ? marketing: Huh . user interface: Mm I'm not sure I {gap} . marketing: {vocalsound} You read the newsflash ? {vocalsound} project manager: 'Kay . Can we get started user interface: No . industrial designer: No what was it about ? marketing: Hmm . project manager: or is there some pressing issue ? industrial designer: Yeah my computer is not functioning properly . project manager: Oh no pressing . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Did you plug in the power cable when you come back ? industrial designer: Yeah yeah . No but my screen is reduced in size . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . That's difficult . Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: What ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Feedback . marketing: Hmm . user interface: Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay . marketing: {gap} alt delete . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} Format . {vocalsound} project manager: Format save . marketing: {gap} . So it doesn't draw the attention away . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: This is dreadful . user interface: I made uh uh my own map . project manager: Oh yeah sure . industrial designer: No not this , but the task . user interface: It's a {disfmarker} project manager: You have Playstation also ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} No that's okay . No I just flapped it , closed it , took it here and then this happened . Ah . Uh {disfmarker} where was it ? In settings ? Okay . Alright . Thank you . project manager: Huh . industrial designer: Do you guys like your tasks ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: I spent a lot of time thinking about what I was gonna do and then a couple of minutes before this I get my function you know the information that I need . user interface: Yeah wa wa you actually {disfmarker} Yeah . But it it's not clear what you have to to to type uh type in your presentation . industrial designer: So frustrating . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . I I had a whole idea and then just was typing it and then oh . I have to do that so switch . industrial designer: Yeah {disfmarker} Yeah exactly . This presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause I hadn't time to intergrate tha the information yet so {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Really annoying . project manager: Okay . So there we are again . marketing: By your humble P_M_ . project manager: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay this is the agenda . Um we have three presentations , I heard . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Really . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah really . {vocalsound} So who wants to start ? marketing: Yeah that's fine {gap} . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: We have to start it right away ? {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . Uh this is you ? marketing: Functional ? Yeah functional requirements . project manager: 'Kay . marketing: Alright . I'm gonna talk about functional requirements . Um {disfmarker} Well uh some research has be done uh has been done . Uh observing of one hundred uh subjects in the usability lab using a remote control . Uh and they also filled in a questionnaire . The findings were um , well you can see them for yourself . They disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls . {vocalsound} Users think they're ugly . Um {vocalsound} they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users . So they they d they don't match what they want to have on it . Um {vocalsound} they are often lost somewhere in the room . Um it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . And they're bad for R_S_I_ . {vocalsound} I don't know uh how a user can reach that but okay . Um {vocalsound} industrial designer: Ts marketing: there is also uh was also some research on uh the most relevant and and and irrelevant uh f functions . Uh most irrelevant and less used were audio settings , mono , stereo , uh pitch , bass . Um screen settings for brightness and colour and stuff like that . Um but they are used . I mean the {disfmarker} industrial designer: So they do need to be in the {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah they do need to be on the on the remote control . industrial designer: Alright . marketing: I mean if you can't control the the sound settings {disfmarker} I mean if you dislike a very uh loud bass or something , you you need to change that . project manager: {vocalsound} {gap} often . marketing: So um yeah we have to . industrial designer: By the way my T_V_ doesn't have an equ equaliser but marketing: We c we c Yeah I mean w we can't {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Next generation does . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {disfmarker} okay . marketing: my my T_V_ has , industrial designer: No . {vocalsound} Alright . marketing: but we we can leave them uh away . Uh most relevant , uh most used functions , uh they speak for themselves I guess . Uh power button , uh channel , volume selection . Uh teletext but we can skip that because I saw the newsflash , and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used uh any more in the future . project manager: N not used anymore . marketing: So forget this one . user interface: Okay . marketing: Uh channel settings , so for programming uh your channels in in the right order . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: By the way where did you guys get that newsflash from ? user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} I was wondering uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: I didn't get anything . marketing: Yeah , {vocalsound} on on the project uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . Not by mail . I receiv the mail but you don't . So {disfmarker} user interface: But you you've got more information than {disfmarker} uh . marketing: No so it's a text file n in the project folder . So teletext can be skipped . project manager: That's in the presentation , so {disfmarker} industrial designer: Alright . marketing: Um there was some research on new features in a remote control . Uh about an L_C_D_ screen uh and speech recognition . Well we got an update for the for the audience . Or the the the targeted group . So it's above forty I guess . project manager: Uh below I believe . marketing: The new product ? Or below {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah below forty . marketing: because that's pretty relevant . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: I thought I read a {disfmarker} project manager: Our current customers are in the age group forty plus . marketing: Yeah ? project manager: And the new product should reach new markets , which is the customers below forty . marketing: Below ? Okay well {vocalsound} user interface: But where did you get uh that information ? project manager: That's in a newsflash . marketing: that's that's in the newsfla project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . {vocalsound} marketing: okay that's a good to know . Um because you see see a clear distinction between the age groups , concerning the features . user interface: Yeah . marketing: I mean uh above forty people are not so interested uh not so interested in a screen or speech recognition . Uh but below that age they uh they pretty much are . So I think we can build that in . Um {disfmarker} Yeah well we can skip this part as well , because I thought I read above forty so we could skip the features , but we just have to build them in because uh they find it very interesting . Um well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible . Um and and also there's {disfmarker} so not only the design of the bus uh buttons but o how you can push them , and stuff like that . So the physical uh aspect of it . Um {disfmarker} And I think {disfmarker} and certainly for for the for the lower age groups , uh nice design , which uh does not make the remote control {gap} in your room . user interface: Yeah . marketing: It's it's actually a part of your interior , of of your design in your room . So it's {vocalsound} the people can say , well what's that , well that's my remote control , so it's d it has to look nice and feel nice , and and have all the functions that uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . But it also needs to have corporate identity . marketing: Yeah so the the logo has to be project manager: Present and the colours . marketing: uh present yeah , and the colours as well . project manager: {vocalsound} So we can't change much of that . industrial designer: Do we have {disfmarker} uh yeah {gap} . marketing: Yeah so but I I don't think that's that's a problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway , and most of the times there is a brand present on it . project manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . marketing: So I think that's not gonna gonna affect it very uh very much . project manager: Okay . marketing: Well that are the the consequences uh on a marketing uh part . project manager: {vocalsound} 'Kay . industrial designer: Alright . marketing: Yes . user interface: Okay . project manager: It's open already so you can use {gap} to marketing: {gap} . project manager: find yours . user interface: Mm . It's {disfmarker} project manager: F_ five . user interface: F_ five . Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} Go Jurgen . user interface: Oh . What is this ? marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Oh no . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: How do I uh {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} You pressed alt F_ four ? {vocalsound} user interface: No no no . I pressed the mouse button . project manager: Oh great . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: It's {disfmarker} th that's the self-destruct button . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: Yeah . Okay . project manager: Uh maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it . user interface: Okay . Um if you all go stand around uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . Just {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Computer {disfmarker} industrial designer: Alright . marketing: Sure . user interface: Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: That's nice . {vocalsound} user interface: No . project manager: F_ five . Yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Okay . marketing: Alright . user interface: I uh had uh two examples . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Um this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: This the easy one marketing: Yeah . user interface: I think we have to to combine them . And uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Um but yeah the the age is uh under forty ? project manager: The mm yeah . marketing: Yeah and and and marketing research stated that that that kind of users are not afraid of of a lot of functions . user interface: So we {disfmarker} Okay so so we have the option for more functions . marketing: So not not too much but {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: Um {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: And we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech {disfmarker} marketing: And the speech recognition yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: alright . user interface: Uh yeah this this one we can remove for kids . It's just only for adults so uh we can uh use some advanced options . But {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah from age of sixteen so yeah . user interface: Yeah but I prefer we we uh use the the basic options uh yeah . We have to to make them very easy so for just uh zapping around the channels you can just push one button . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: But if you want to to use your your video recorder or something else , you should use use an uh an advanced option . marketing: Yeah but uh the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device , only your television . user interface: Okay one device . project manager: Yeah . So n it's very easy . user interface: Okay . I didn't see {gap} . marketing: So w project manager: Now yeah it's okay . user interface: {vocalsound} Okay and I also uh yeah . W yeah . marketing: So there are not extra options in this case , but uh {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . user interface: We have to make it fashionable . Like you uh said uh before . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Uh yeah the basic functions . Um yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed . project manager: Yeah so maybe you can hide them or something . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah well what what we can do with the screen is is all the the configuration options , you can put that in the screen . project manager: Yeah you make a screen menu or something . marketing: And the and the {disfmarker} yeah screen menu to to to uh to do that , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: and then the basic function just on the device itself . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: So it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen , uh with a clear menu . project manager: Yeah and the other oth other uh functionality is the screen . user interface: Yeah . project manager: What does the screen do ? user interface: {vocalsound} Did I uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Alright . marketing: Uh . {vocalsound} What are {disfmarker} wh project manager: Yeah . It's low power . user interface: did I break it ? {vocalsound} marketing: What {gap} . project manager: So what does the screen do ? They said they needed it but what does it do ? What do they want with the screen ? user interface: For for the advanced functions I think . project manager: Yeah that's what we make it up . marketing: Yeah well it {gap} yeah it didn't project manager: So but what did the marketing {disfmarker} marketing: it didn't say what they want to do with the screen . project manager: No . marketing: Well I , my guess is it's it's pretty handy for advanced uh advanced functions . project manager: Yeah okay it's handy . With no predefined uh {disfmarker} user interface: Like searching for channels and {disfmarker} industrial designer: Ah look . marketing: Yeah searching for channels , programming them . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: We have your uh {disfmarker} oh never mind . {vocalsound} project manager: We're back online . {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . That's uh {disfmarker} I'm al I'm almost finished so {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Um the {disfmarker} we have to to to watch out for the {disfmarker} i if we make it f very fashionable , it it the functional functionality will go down . So we have to make uh a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable project manager: Mm-hmm . Content and form . user interface: yeah content and form . industrial designer: {gap} . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} Now that that was uh was the end . project manager: {vocalsound} That was the end . Okay . user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Well my presentation is a bit uh sucky . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Well you can improvise right ? project manager: Uh which one is it ? Technical functions ? industrial designer: Yeah a little bit . project manager: This one ? industrial designer: Uh no . No no . {vocalsound} project manager: Functional requirements ? industrial designer: Yeah I think that would be it then . {gap} project manager: No . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: You didn't put it in ? Or {disfmarker} industrial designer: I have no idea . marketing: So we we can go for {disfmarker} industrial designer: That w {gap} . project manager: {gap} it's not really English . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Let me check . I know . project manager: Uh kick off . Oh working design I got it . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So we can go for the look-and-feel of the the left example , and then a screen on top of it . project manager: Here you go . industrial designer: Alright how do I uh skip pages ? project manager: Just uh press uh {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: The keys yeah ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Alright . Um yeah well I was working on this before I got my information . So I was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about uh remote controls . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: And well the info on the website which came too late . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Um so I didn't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: So uh uh this is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last uh meeting . Those were my uh starting points . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Uh I was working on a s yeah on a schedule , and I was supposed to do it like this . But um yeah then uh the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow , so I was trying to organise them for myself . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Mm . industrial designer: And then make the project manager: Design yeah . industrial designer: the design , a the actual design , marketing: Design ? Yeah . industrial designer: but I never came around to do that . So I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say about it . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: I mean everything speaks for itself I guess . Mean you press a button um {vocalsound} the it tru goes , it sends a signal to a chip , project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: which uh translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Yeah frequency . Yeah . industrial designer: And uh or temporal fr frequencies actually . And then uh through a uh transformer , it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the T_V_ project manager: Yeah decoder . industrial designer: and the T_V_ will translate it into a function . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah well this was actually {vocalsound} all I got around to do . project manager: {vocalsound} Blank . Yeah okay . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: I mean I dunno if I'm too slow for this stuff , but uh {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Work harder . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want uh {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . Whatever . project manager: Yeah . Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah we want to incorporate in uh into it . user interface: Yeah . project manager: 'Kay . Um for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext , only for T_V_ . Uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty , but I don't think it's w wrong if we can uh target the current customer group as well . marketing: Mm . project manager: And uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control . And we have to decide on the functions , and on the , let's see what was it , uh the target group . We have to make be clear what that is . marketing: {gap} group of users , or {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah users . marketing: because it says below forty I mean . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah so I think it's easy but {disfmarker} marketing: I guess that's that's the tar yeah uh or male and female {disfmarker} user interface: But uh it's it's also for children or just uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah it's below forty so we can decide where to {disfmarker} marketing: Uh six {disfmarker} the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen . user interface: Okay . Okay . marketing: Sixteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , thirty five to forty five , something like that . project manager: Okay . So below forty is okay . marketing: So um {disfmarker} project manager: But we need an {disfmarker} lower level which to s uh focus . marketing: How do you mean ? project manager: So is it from sixteen to forty ? Is it from twenty to forty ? Is it from thirty ? marketing: Uh sixteen to forty . project manager: Yeah ? 'Kay . user interface: Yeah . We we have to {disfmarker} marketing: Well I I guess people of sixteen are are quite used to technology . project manager: Yeah . marketing: So they they adapt to it pretty soon I guess . user interface: And if we have a larger public we have uh yeah more options to to uh sell our product . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah so what we might wanna do is uh yeah cust I have customised the screen functions , if you know what I mean . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: The uh younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions . But maybe elderly people don't understand it so well , so they need a simpler remote . project manager: Design . Mm . industrial designer: And yeah that you can choose what the design displays , or wha whatever . user interface: Yeah that's that's why uh I wanted to to make yeah two uh different uh yeah groups of functions . The the simple functions for for the the whole public , and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} And maybe y industrial designer: Experienced yeah . marketing: But uh all incorporated in the screen or or just on the remote itself ? user interface: Na I w I should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display . marketing: Yeah project manager: Yeah . marketing: like like you have a visual of the of the brightness with with a kind of sliding bar and a bus and and stuff like that for sound and and vis and and visuals ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . So is {disfmarker} you should have a menu for all the the functions you don't use regular and which are {disfmarker} marketing: Uh you can make a {disfmarker} if you make a drawing . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . Aye yeah . marketing: Uh {disfmarker} Uh {gap} . project manager: Shall I uh {disfmarker} marketing: Uh black's okay . {vocalsound} And draw it very big . project manager: Yeah . It's okay . marketing: Oh . {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: {gap} no , it doesn't have line control , so {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah we get the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah well , this is basically uh it's {disfmarker} industrial designer: The remote ? project manager: The remote , yeah ? marketing: alright the remote ? Um well usually the power button is on top I guess . project manager: Basic . Is on top . Which should be easy , easily reached with the thumb . marketing: Yeah so it should fit right in into your hand . user interface: Yeah . L left top or right uh top ? project manager: T I s should said right . marketing: Right . Right . user interface: Yeah , right . industrial designer: Right top . marketing: I most people are right-handed so {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah definitely . marketing: maybe left-handed special addition , but okay . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: If you put it like like here . Or something . I dunno . Um then you could put a screen , like on a mobile phone , also on top I guess . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah but if you are using the the normal functions , the the basic functions , you normally press them on the u yeah . project manager: Do the also with the thumb . So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your uh thumb , also reach the middle . Or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly . marketing: Okay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand , and the screen is below , and the buttons are in the middle . project manager: You you need to be able to hold it so {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Okay for example {vocalsound} if you put the screen here , it's more about the functions now than the than the layout . project manager: Yeah okay that's true . Layout . That's for the {disfmarker} marketing: Doesn't work too well . It's uh it's bent . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: I can't help it . {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} . user interface: You broke it . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: {gap} . project manager: Man . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Right . project manager: Yeah okay . {vocalsound} marketing: Okay you get it . Uh for example if y if you put all the {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Right . project manager: {vocalsound} You want the normal piece of paper ? And you have a pen ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: And might be easier huh ? marketing: Maybe this . {gap} kind of works . project manager: Yeah ? marketing: Like if you have like uh ten buttons for for all the for all the channels , project manager: Mm-hmm . Uh . marketing: um and here one for for project manager: And the for flipping up and down . user interface: Yeah yeah . And volume control . marketing: Yeah that that usually uh {disfmarker} like here , here , here , here . industrial designer: Yeah I {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: So you have up and down for the for the channels , and left and right for the volume uh {disfmarker} project manager: And left to right . And those can also be used for the menu . industrial designer: Yeah exactly . I thought {disfmarker} but this is really your department , that we need just the functional display and four cursors . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah okay but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things {disfmarker} marketing: And you you have {vocalsound} industrial designer: And {disfmarker} marketing: most of the time you have one button in the middle . It says menu , industrial designer: Yeah okay . project manager: For the menu . Yeah . marketing: and then if you press it you {disfmarker} the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into functon project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and then just {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . marketing: mo most of the time this menu button is also like okay , to to confirm a a kind of action . project manager: Yeah . marketing: So you scroll into it , okay . You select a function like v like uh bass . You just adjust it with these two buttons . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Then okay to confirm , and then uh on on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: And then finally say okay , exit . Or or one button to exit it . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Uh in one time I dunno , that's not really my department . user interface: {vocalsound} And do we need a a logo on our uh remote control , or {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} That's more your uh your department to to uh to {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . But it should be {disfmarker} if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top , user interface: On the left uh top yeah . marketing: yeah . I mean it's uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah but that depends on where you put the screen . user interface: Okay . project manager: But it's essential that there is a screen . marketing: Yeah . Yeah I mean the position of the screen is also more essential than {disfmarker} I mean we we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there . project manager: Yeah . And for the speech uh recognition part , if we want to incorporate that , we need a microphone . marketing: But um {disfmarker} Yeah so it should be {disfmarker} I mean if you have it in your hand here , should be on top somewhere , maybe . project manager: Yeah . This would be uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Why did we wanna put the display in the bottom ? marketing: I mean i project manager: No that's not s sure so {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . marketing: That's not sure project manager: uh we need a display . marketing: but it's {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah may maybe because you're {disfmarker} industrial designer: Because yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display . user interface: Yeah okay but {gap} only for the basic functi if you're going to use the advanced option , you're going to press the the menu button and then {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: Yeah I mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me . industrial designer: Normal for logical t project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Also because people use m mobile phones and they also have the screen on top . project manager: Yeah they're used to it . user interface: Okay the {disfmarker} yeah . That's possible . marketing: So you you just have to reach a little bit for the power button . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: I mean if you grab it . industrial designer: On once it's on it's on . You don't need the power button . marketing: But most most of the times if a if if a T_V_'s on standby people just press a channel to put it on . user interface: Yeah , okay . Okay we put it on top . marketing: So we put this on top , and then make the corporate logo user interface: Yeah . marketing: like over here . R_R_ . And j and the microphone , I mean it can be very small . If you look at your mobile phones {gap} are some stripes , {vocalsound} little little holes . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Maybe on the top or even on the side . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah maybe on the side . I mean if the if the microphone is good . project manager: Yeah but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: True . marketing: Yeah okay . So on the on the top is better . project manager: I think that top is the best option . industrial designer: {vocalsound} But if you uh if you hold the ma the remote like this , if you put it on the top on the side {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah okay . industrial designer: I dunno . Should be able to work . marketing: Yeah . {gap} . project manager: Depends on the sensitivity of the microphone , but I think that's okay . industrial designer: Never mind . Can we leave this up to you ? {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah it doesn't matter that much . So {disfmarker} but um the screen is on top ? Which functions did we have left ? I mean this is basically numbers , volume , uh channel up and down . project manager: Volume . Up . Channel up and down , and the control of the advanced options . marketing: Screen is over there . project manager: So maybe it , we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the L_C_D_ screen . user interface: Yeah . If we {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . Yeah . That's uh that's a good one . industrial designer: Yeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and uh and image options right ? project manager: Yeah so sounds ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Like uh bass uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . Sound ? industrial designer: so we need kind of an equaliser . If you {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . Equaliser . So if you have sound {disfmarker} But not too advanced . I mean most T_V_s use only treble and bass . project manager: Yeah user interface: Yeah it it's just a remote control so {disfmarker} project manager: and they're {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah treble , middl middle , bass or something . project manager: They're not used often so {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . It's uh pretty hard to write . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Ah as {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah just {disfmarker} industrial designer: {gap} . marketing: {vocalsound} Mm . Okay but you have sound ? project manager: Yeah sounds . marketing: Yeah just {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . marketing: oh y you have digital uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {gap} . marketing: better write it down over there yeah . project manager: Of course . I'm just a {vocalsound} secretary . marketing: So you have sound . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Coffee ? marketing: {vocalsound} Uh yeah sound and then within sound I guess treble and bass ? industrial designer: Yes please . project manager: Treble bass . industrial designer: {gap} the mono stereo option ? marketing: Yeah . Also . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: And there there was something else also . project manager: Pitch I believe , yeah . industrial designer: And then pitch . marketing: Pitch . Yeah . But pitch , isn't that {disfmarker} yeah that's the the height of the tone . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: The fr yeah the frequency of the tones , yeah . marketing: Yeah okay , project manager: Yeah and mono stereo . marketing: wh why would you use that ? industrial designer: Yeah isn't that that depends on the on the signal of the of what program you're watching . marketing: If people like talk like uh {disfmarker} project manager: Mm . marketing: Yeah . project manager: And also the tuning part ? marketing: Programming part . project manager: Yeah programming . So channel programming ? marketing: Uh so we have sound , yeah ? Channel programming . industrial designer: And yeah in the functionality of the user interface: Television uh itself uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: no no of the remote uh do do we want uh the buttons to make sound when you press them ? As a confirmation or whatever you know ? user interface: Mm . marketing: Mm . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: I dunno . marketing: I think it g it gets annoying . project manager: Yeah . marketing: I mean most mobile phones used that in the beginning but {disfmarker} user interface: We we could make an option for it , but uh you can disable s industrial designer: Under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things . user interface: Yeah . But uh the the television itself has also the the options {gap} brightness and uh screen colour etcetera . So {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Contrast yeah . user interface: yeah . marketing: Yeah but people don't want to sit on their knees on their knees in front of their television with {gap} only three buttons then it's very hard to project manager: Mm . No . Uh , so contrast , marketing: y yeah contrast and brightness ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: bright , marketing: Yeah those are the most used I guess . If you look at your monitor . project manager: uh {disfmarker} And the others were in your presentation right ? So I can just copy those ? marketing: Well {vocalsound} yeah well I guess that these were the only ones , I guess . project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} It's easy . {vocalsound} industrial designer: But so we have we have T_V_ options , which is all this . marketing: Yeah . I will look it up . project manager: Yeah the button options and the L_C_D_ options . industrial designer: The sound , sound and image . And you have in that uh the indeed the remote control options . project manager: Indeed . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: So we need two menus kind of thing . project manager: Yeah you have basically a button menu , which you can use directly , uh according to the old principle . industrial designer: Uh-huh . project manager: And the L_C_D_ options are activated by some some software options , thats communicates with the infrared uh decoder yeah . marketing: Yeah with the chip and then {gap} I mean {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} So you {disfmarker} You have an additional processor and and software part . marketing: Uh {disfmarker} yeah . Well {disfmarker} yeah we have power button , whether that's present . project manager: Compared to o industrial designer: Alright . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Channel volume selection present . Uh numbers present . Yeah a audio settings , mono , stereo , pitch , bass , treble . Screen settings , brightness and colour . project manager: L_ s Yeah . Colour . Yeah I I call it contrast . marketing: Yeah con contrast is {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah I make it c colour . marketing: Yeah okay , colour and brightness . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Um and what you say , channel settings or channel programming ? So you you have an option to to start scanning all the frequencies , and when it encounters one , well it shows on your T_V_ . And then you can um {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah and automatically um {disfmarker} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} marketing: Uh and then you can select uh a number in your remote on which you want to save it . project manager: Yeah so I've g channel program is autoseek ? marketing: Yeah , autoseek . project manager: {vocalsound} Uh name a channel , or {disfmarker} marketing: Well most T_V_s automatically display the name , which they get through the cable . project manager: Oh they get automatic names , okay . marketing: Yeah . So you only have to choose the position on your project manager: {gap} . marketing: It only has to match the the channel frequency on your T_V_ , with with the with the position on your T_V_ and and so your remote . project manager: Yeah . Yeah but can you also say I want f uh Veronica on the channel number uh five or {disfmarker} industrial designer: Help . marketing: If you already programmed it . project manager: Yeah . marketing: If you want to move it . Yeah that should be possible too . project manager: Yeah . How do you call that ? {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah how do you call that ? Mm ? Wait you you should be able to to browse through a list or something , which w displays all the all the values , all the channels which are possible . project manager: Channels ? Yeah . marketing: I mean like one to f thirty of or ninety or whatever . project manager: Ninety nine or something . Yeah . marketing: Just browse through it and then um in some kind of way see if it if it if it is programmed . project manager: S swap channels ? Can I call it that ? marketing: Yeah . Swap channels . project manager: Swap's good option . Okay . Uh other functions ? marketing: So you {disfmarker} most of the time if you if you swap it {disfmarker} S uh let's say for example you have uh R_T_L_ five on on channel five . And Veronica on channel eight and you want to move Veronica to channel five , most of the times you override the previous uh the previous one . project manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Okay . Well that's 's up to uh Mister User Interface Designer . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . It's it's pretty uh {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . marketing: yeah I mean you have to look on on the menu industrial designer: {gap} working design . Doch . project manager: {vocalsound} Also . marketing: on the T_V_ . project manager: That's {disfmarker} you're {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} He only has to figure out how it has to look . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah but also , which buttons you have to press to get a certain result ? industrial designer: And how user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: to use {disfmarker} project manager: And the working design was to specify how ph the physical interation between the components was , as I believe . industrial designer: Yeah okay . But {disfmarker} You did your homework . But um {disfmarker} yeah . Okay . marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Or or is it too hard to to ju to just do it all on your remote ? To programme the channels ? project manager: No I don't think so . industrial designer: No no . It should be able to do any remote . user interface: No that's {disfmarker} marketing: Uh . project manager: But I think the communication with the television is difficult . But that's not our part . marketing: Yeah . project manager: We don't have to design a protocol so {disfmarker} marketing: No . industrial designer: No . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: That's true . That's true . industrial designer: Thank god . user interface: Okay {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . So we have a figure a figure out a way to to do that easily . I mean th the autoseek is is not a problem . project manager: No that's the {disfmarker} marketing: I mean you uh you uh current channel and then then it just says , uh on which number do you want to save this , and you just press a number on your remote , and then say confirm , okay , and then it's it's saved . It's easier , {gap} it's it's it's harder to , if you have already programmed it , to to swap . project manager: Yeah . So but {disfmarker} marketing: So we have to think of something for that . project manager: Um {disfmarker} The User Interface Designer can design a menu for all these function I put them on the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah k kind of structure into layers . user interface: On the uh yeah can you i make a a map with with all the {disfmarker} yeah 'cause it's now {disfmarker} there are lots and lots of documents project manager: {gap} . Yeah . Yeah I can . user interface: and {disfmarker} project manager: I'll just try to reorganise uh things . Um {disfmarker} marketing: So {disfmarker} project manager: So you design the basic function menu for the L_C_D_ screen ? Uh um {disfmarker} I think {vocalsound} marketing: And and the layout of of the thing itself . project manager: th I think the yeah the layout of the screen user interface: The the layout of the remote control ? project manager: and I think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the uh screen itself on the {disfmarker} marketing: {gap} . user interface: Isn't that more the the u uh the user interface part ? project manager: {gap} . No I d I think that's more in {disfmarker} {gap} . industrial designer: Uh all the functional uh aspects of the remote I think are in my department . marketing: Maybe more on {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: I have to know what it has to do , so if you wanna you know the changing the channels kind of s thing is , I have to integrate that in the design . project manager: Okay . So he's layout and you're function . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Form function okay . {vocalsound} industrial designer: I think that's a that's a good separation . marketing: Okay . user interface: But do I have to to uh to yeah to make the the menu layout also ? Or {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . user interface: Are you going to do that ? industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Yeah . Yeah I guess so . user interface: Yeah ? I I'm going to make {disfmarker} project manager: I think i that's your department yes , user interface: yeah o okay . project manager: because w he already knows what {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah we have to kind of work together . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: If if I make the the the yeah the menu like , I have to state which function has to be in the menu , project manager: But we're not allowed . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: and then you have to decide , it's , in a in a way that b is user-friendly . user interface: Yeah . Okay . Y you you are going to make a list of what functions are uh are going to to be on the the screen , the menu screen . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: And I'm going to make a a nice menu uh with with {gap} pages and yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: I think {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: With with some l with some layers in it . project manager: Yeah and also make clear which buttons to press to get certain result , marketing: So some menus . project manager: because that's always the difficulty . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Every device has its own {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . Well I guess this this button , the the the okay , project manager: Menu okay . marketing: menu okay . Or you can incorporate two uh difference uh different buttons . Uh like uh for your mobile phone . Um so this is only for to get in the menu , or to exit it . project manager: Mm . marketing: And then one to confirm , and one to go one step back . project manager: Back . Yeah . marketing: So it's like the the save button on your your mobile phone , if you have a Nokia or like that . Or the or the no button . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: To go one step back you {gap} it's only two extra buttons , user interface: Yeah . W we {disfmarker} marketing: but if it if it's very clear that they are for the screen {disfmarker} user interface: Uh I think we have to to group , to make two groups . Um the {disfmarker} one group for the for the display , and one group for the basic functions , and {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah but they're incorporated {gap} ? Up and down is {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah okay but we we have a m marketing: Yeah because this this is used for both . user interface: yeah but maybe that's that's not uh {disfmarker} project manager: Smart ? user interface: yeah if you're if you're z zapping uh with your uh yeah remote control , you can press the the menu button , and then you are suddenly into the the yeah the display . marketing: Into your screen . Okay . So you industrial designer: You wanna separate uh {vocalsound} marketing: l should leave the menu button out of here . user interface: Yeah . marketing: And {gap} and just put it under the screen , the screen {disfmarker} project manager: Put it on top . user interface: Yeah j just just group group the {disfmarker} yeah we make these the advanced functions and these the basic functions . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: So we make a yeah a line between them . marketing: Yeah . But we should place the screen on top , right ? project manager: Well {disfmarker} user interface: F oh yeah . Okay yeah we swap uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: But that's uh J Jurgen's department . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . So we make it a {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . You just you just find out and {gap} . project manager: You just make the layout . You {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . project manager: do we do the extra two buttons or not ? user interface: Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: I think you should . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: It's easier . If you put too many functions in one button it gets confusing . project manager: Yeah okay . That's true . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . So we have a a menu button and a s project manager: And to , okay and back , also . user interface: Okay . Okay and back button . marketing: Yeah . Yeah , or confirm and back . Whatever . project manager: And of course the four arrows . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: No . project manager: But those are still y doubly used . Both the L_C_D_ {disfmarker} marketing: Should we save this picture , or or you know what it looks like ? user interface: Yeah I'm I'm not s clear about uh the the extra two buttons . We have a menu button and {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . That that just to to activate the screen . So {disfmarker} user interface: That's the the one with the {disfmarker} yeah okay . project manager: Menu button access the menu in the L_C_D_ screen . marketing: And then with these buttons , woa , y you navigate . project manager: You can navigate . user interface: Okay . project manager: But you can also navigate the channels . And the volume . user interface: Okay so that that's not uh {disfmarker} Yeah that {disfmarker} Those are project manager: Those are both both {disfmarker} user interface: multifunctional . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: Hey is it interesting for users if we put LED lights under the buttons ? So that if you uh press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up . marketing: Yeah . L l litten up yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Oh five minutes . marketing: That's very good idea . industrial designer: N marketing: Alright . project manager: Light uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah that's a good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now , which you can use . industrial designer: Yeah and then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button . project manager: Yeah sure . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Um {disfmarker} marketing: So {disfmarker} project manager: Anything else ? marketing: Those buttons are are lit up . industrial designer: I think not . marketing: But just one thing . Should we use those two ? Them ? Or only this to to scroll ? project manager: I've {disfmarker} marketing: And then use the two functional buttons to confirm , to go into something ? Oh no we have to use this to adjust some some bars ? project manager: Volume . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah keep it optional 'cause maybe you can you know go left to right and up and down in a in one menu . marketing: Yeah . And maybe we should use this also as an okay button , still . And then just only a back button . project manager: Well we have those buttons . We use all four . user interface: No {disfmarker} industrial designer: The pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is , sorry project manager: Yeah okay go ahead . marketing: Yeah ? industrial designer: sorry , uh is uh if you're pressing up and down , you can easily press the okay once you , when you're not already at your choice . user interface: Yeah . So maybe make one uh one okay button and and one navigation button . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah that was already decided . marketing: And one back . user interface: Yeah the with with the the channel and the volume uh {disfmarker} yeah m a multifunctional navigation button . project manager: Okay that's what we decided earlier on . user interface: Yeah okay . Yeah . project manager: Right okay . So {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: You wanna close down huh ? {vocalsound} project manager: yeah I wanna close down . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: I have to , sorry . marketing: Yeah . project manager: it's not because I don't like you but {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: That's okay . project manager: yh we have lunch break , industrial designer: Already . project manager: and then we can work for thirty minutes , and I have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes . And then uh we'll see {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Alright . How m how long is the lunchbreak ? project manager: I don't know . Nobody told me . {vocalsound} marketing: We have to ask . {vocalsound} user interface: But do we have to write uh to write down uh the our stuff now ? Or first lunchbreak ? industrial designer: Okay . project manager: No I th believe there's first lunch break . user interface: Because I {disfmarker} I've everything in my head now {vocalsound} so {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . Or you can just {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm . user interface: Okay . project manager: Yeah ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: 'Kay . marketing: Yes . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: I think you can put uh the laptop back in the room and {disfmarker} user interface: 'Kay . industrial designer: This is {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yes sir . {vocalsound} marketing: Time pressure . project manager: {vocalsound} 'Kay . Yeah it's a lot of pressure . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . Sorry for my uh not finished presentation uh . project manager: That's okay . Oh yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Oh no no . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah we'll kick your ass later . No . {vocalsound} Uh . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Bring it on . project manager: I don't know if it works but it should be saved . marketing: Aye {disfmarker} Y you saved it ? Does it save automatically in the project folder ? Or {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . It's uh {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . We'll see . project manager: Should be here . Smart board . marketing: Just put back my laptop . project manager: Don't know if you can use it but {disfmarker} marketing: Alright . user interface: Okay . marketing: Yeah you can open it with the picture preview or stuff like that . user interface: And uh we have to make uh some maps with uh with the all the the data we uh gathered . project manager: Yeah . I try to organise it by these three . user interface: {vocalsound} {gap} . It's it's just my own map so I put everything into the {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah {gap} yeah yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: I don't really mind . I just put the minutes here and we'll see . user interface: But you got some extra information uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah that's in the functional design uh folder . user interface: Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . Yeah that's just basically what I just showed . user interface: But where do you did you get the newsflash ? project manager: Yeah . Yeah I got it by {disfmarker} user interface: You're the only one uh {disfmarker} okay . project manager: yeah . I'm gonna get kicked if I don't do it so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} internet . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Alright . marketing: Alright . user interface: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Make me proud . industrial designer: {vocalsound} I'll try to . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So first we have a lunchbreak now ? user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Alright . project manager: I believe so . {gap} just ask . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . I dunno where she {gap} .
