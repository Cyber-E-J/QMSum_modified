project manager: Okay . Oh , that's not gonna work . {vocalsound} Oh , alright . {vocalsound} Okay . Okay . Um alright . marketing: Uh , uh , um . project manager: I'll just put that there . Uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote . Uh I'm Nick Debusk , I'm the Project Manager . Uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is um . Go ahead . marketing: Okay . {vocalsound} I am Corinne Whiting and I will be the Marketing Expert and in each of the three phases I will have a different role . In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and I'll be doing research to figure this out . In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching and I'll be doing marketing research on the web . And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation and so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did . project manager: 'Kay . user interface: Hiya , I'm Ryan . Um I'm the User Interface Designer . Um likewise I've three different roles for each stage of design . Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control . Um in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the the product . And the detailed design um {vocalsound} sort of like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , uh things like fashions , what makes wha how we're gonna make it special . That's about it . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Right . {vocalsound} I'm Manuel and I'm the Industrial Designer in in this project um . In the functional design phase I'm {disfmarker} I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on . Um I suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one . Um um in the conceptual design um I'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: And uh the detailed design {disfmarker} in the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , um so we're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here . Okay . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . Um so we've got our opening , our our agenda is the opening , uh acquaintance which we've kinda done . Uh tool training , project plan discussion and then closing . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here . Um so we are putting together a new remote control . Um we want it to be something original . Um of course we're a {disfmarker} not only a electronics company but a fashion um conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use . {vocalsound} Um we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um . And w uh {vocalsound} well um functional design um . Um do we have {disfmarker} um any ideas of of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} maybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and and how we're gonna do the detailing on it . user interface: Yeah . Well uh s function of remote control is just just {disfmarker} you know , change channels is its main function . project manager: So we want it to be um a T_V_ remote or {disfmarker} I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ? user interface: Oh right . I suppose you c try make it a universal remote project manager: 'Kay . user interface: for {disfmarker} could work on all sort of electrical products in in one person's house . But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Mm-hmm . 'Kay . industrial designer: Mm . user interface: I think they all work on the same prin principle as well sorta like {disfmarker} I don't actually know . {gap} But is it just infra-red ? Is that standard ? project manager: I I think {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , r universal remote . user interface: Ye yeah . project manager: Um this is my first uh go-round with creating a remote control , marketing: Huh . {vocalsound} project manager: so {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Ours too . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} I think we're all in the same boat here . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} user interface: Um one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em . project manager: Okay . user interface: So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily , I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature . marketing: Mm . Ch project manager: So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh marketing: Like a tracking device ? {vocalsound} project manager: like a tracking device or or like a a {disfmarker} user interface: Oh you can get those key {disfmarker} well you could whistle or make a noise project manager: It makes a noise , user interface: and it'd beep . project manager: there's a button on the T_V_ that you press industrial designer: Mm , mm . project manager: and {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Right . project manager: 'Kay . marketing: Be good . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} user interface: Generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance . project manager: Yeah . Do we want {disfmarker} user interface: Just long . project manager: so they're kinda like long and rectangular . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Do we want something crazy ? user interface: Black usually . project manager: You know , we want something new that's gonna stand out . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Lot more modern . project manager: A m a modern {disfmarker} so our remote should be {disfmarker} user interface: I think so . Maybe sorta spherical or something . A ball . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Maybe like user-friendly , like a little user interface: Yeah . marketing: you know , where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing . user interface: People {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm . user interface: I thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another {disfmarker} if it was in a ball , project manager: 'Kay . user interface: and maybe the actual controls are inside or something . marketing: Mm . project manager: Um . industrial designer: Well there are of course certain restrictions , you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: so there are always the {disfmarker} some restrictions we have to apply here . Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , pretty much um . What are we gonna build that thing out of ? marketing: Mm . industrial designer: How sturdy is it gonna be ? Do we want it to last longer or rather have people whatever , have to buy one every half a year ? project manager: {vocalsound} Okay so {disfmarker} yeah , so we want it to be sturdy , user interface: Yeah . project manager: we want it to to hold up to somebody's child , you know , throwing it across the room or , as you said , people kinda throw it , so ball-shaped , uh you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe , user interface: Yeah . project manager: then it {disfmarker} user interface: It could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside . project manager: 'Kay . Um so we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy , um {disfmarker} So our form and our function . Um we want it to be um easy to find . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} What else {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} what else do we want it to to do ? So we want it to be universal . It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros um and you know , goals for profits are I think somewhere around uh fifty million Euros , what they wanna make on it , so . marketing: Mm . Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association , maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal . project manager: 'Kay . marketing: That's more on the research end , but {disfmarker} the marketing . project manager: So marketing , you know , how {disfmarker} maybe uh marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing {vocalsound} remote control out there . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: And maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences , project manager: 'Kay . marketing: 'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting . user interface: Ye Small . industrial designer: Right . project manager: Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? Maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there . Some ideas ? We want it to be a b a ball , user interface: {gap} I'd {disfmarker} I could draw sorta the ball idea . project manager: you know , we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball and maybe th um where the buttons are located . user interface: My original idea was just simply sort of a sphere , where maybe you {disfmarker} this is where it's connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle {disfmarker} Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it . If that {disfmarker} if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: and then you'd have just sorta you you you know , your buttons . Thing is inside I think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , so maybe as simple as possible , um as few buttons inside as possible . Um , I dunno , what's the idea for . Just something {disfmarker} maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it . It's looking a bit like something out of Star Wars at the moment though , to be fair . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} But yeah . marketing: Futuristic . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: That was that was a sorta simple idea I had project manager: Uh-huh . user interface: and then you know you could {gap} about {disfmarker} Right , it would almost be like a ball . So that was just just an idea I had . I don't know whether anybody else has other ideas ? industrial designer: Right . One problem you'd get with this design is um {disfmarker} the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: but of course , since it's a ball , it'll roll , so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , user interface: Yeah . Maybe f yeah . industrial designer: take away that part . That's one of the big issues . Also also you risk the hinges here . That's that's um a problem . user interface: Yeah , that's g that's a good idea . Yeah . The idea {disfmarker} it didn't have to necessarily be f a hinge , industrial designer: {vocalsound} That's that's {vocalsound} interesting of course , user interface: that was just one idea though . industrial designer: but that's of course a weak point , yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: How would we go about um making you know {disfmarker} getting rid of our weak points ? What {disfmarker} I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ? user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Not to put you on the spot , industrial designer: {vocalsound} E No no , project manager: but {disfmarker} industrial designer: uh uh {vocalsound} . project manager: What did you say your title was again ? industrial designer: N n marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: You're the the Industrial Designer . industrial designer: Uh , I'm your Industrial Designer , marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: so i b well , project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: the point is that {vocalsound} well maybe {disfmarker} I dunno . The shape is perhaps not the most ideal . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: As as stable as it is , there must be a compromise between um stability and design here , so . user interface: Well I I suppose that things become {gap} design . But I mean i marketing: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} user interface: I was trying to think of like the design of others . I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote , project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: maybe small , sort of fatter ones , but there's nothing being done sort of out of left field , yeah . project manager: It's not new , it's not innovative , it's {disfmarker} you know , everybody does long remote because it's easy , user interface: Yeah . project manager: it's it's stable um . marketing: 'Kay , I'll draw something . {vocalsound} project manager: So if {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: What ? {vocalsound} project manager: no , go ahead . marketing: My idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape , you know , like video games user interface: Yeah . marketing: l so . But maybe {disfmarker} I mean that would be kinda big and bulky . We could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way . I don't know . {vocalsound} That's my idea . user interface: I think definitely doing something different marketing: Yeah . user interface: is a good idea . industrial designer: Mm . user interface: I mean maybe design something , that's sort of like {vocalsound} suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same , but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier . project manager: Something with a grip . marketing: Mm . Yeah . user interface: Yeah , with a grip . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Because even {disfmarker} I suppose even with the ball user interface: It still might be hard to {disfmarker} project manager: it's {disfmarker} user interface: it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah . project manager: it might not be the easiest to hold onto um . industrial designer: Mm . project manager: So perhaps the the joystick {disfmarker} the the keyboard idea might work better . user interface: Like {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: But then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda , so maybe maybe we {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} True . user interface: It's d yeah . I think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job . marketing: Mm . project manager: I feel like I'm just shooting everything down here . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} That's fine . project manager: Uh {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} marketing: You're the boss , you're {vocalsound} allowed to . industrial designer: Well with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size w 'cause you know from cell phones , they can be too small . So if the remote is too small it {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: if it's small it probably looks better , but may not be th as functional . So for that there's {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , so industrial designer: So {disfmarker} project manager: unfortunately we've got about five minutes here {vocalsound} to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it . Um we've talked about our experiences with remote control and um we've got a couple ideas um . Let's see here . What if we had what if we had not only um {disfmarker} say we went with the ball the ball function um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to . So you know um s so it's easier to hold onto that way . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Course that'll then remove some of our our ball . Unless this unless this part were raised , so say the cover flips over and covers that part . So the grip is {disfmarker} No , that wouldn't work either um . But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . So if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here I guess , um and then {vocalsound} flat uh {disfmarker} And then we have the problem with the hinge . So if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , it'll stay where we want . industrial designer: The question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ? project manager: Mm , that's true . industrial designer: {vocalsound} It's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , so I don't know if a lid is a good idea . From stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is , but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , uh the more we sell . So it's {disfmarker} don't make it too stable {vocalsound} uh . project manager: So we don't have it flip open . We just have a ball {disfmarker} user interface: But then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then . industrial designer: To the other design . project manager: Okay , so then we forget the ball . industrial designer: {vocalsound} It looks cool . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Looks cool though . project manager: {vocalsound} It looks cool , but it's really not {disfmarker} it's not functional um . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Uh {vocalsound} functional . project manager: So we've got our sort of keyboard kind . What if we flipped it around here , so that it were um {disfmarker} Sorry , that doesn't look anything like what you {vocalsound} had there . Um so it's up and down , you hold it this way . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Course then it's it's like the rectangular {vocalsound} again , only with a couple of jutting out points . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Right . Right . project manager: But it's one-handed um . industrial designer: Question is what makes those game pads functional ? W I think that's pretty much the form for full hand . So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: right , marketing: Mm . industrial designer: makes it nice , so that's the essential part . Except for that I think we'll not {disfmarker} probably not get a get away from some longer design . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Right . industrial designer: 'Cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: You know , all project manager: because it doesn't have a cord , like joysticks do . industrial designer: that dif batteries {disfmarker} right , and {disfmarker} Batteries go weak as well , so um after a while you have to point it towards the uh towards the equipment you wanna control with it , right ? So , have to m show which is the front , which is the back . project manager: Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ? So that either way you're pointing it it would work . industrial designer: I suppose you could do that . O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so . project manager: More expensive and {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: Course you can do that . project manager: {vocalsound} 'Kay . Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: I mean of course it'll be evident after a while or {disfmarker} if you look at it , it'll it'll be evident which way around to point it , since you have the the numbers and the and the {vocalsound} the buttons and stuff , project manager: True . industrial designer: but um it's rather about an instinctual thing , user interface: Put it {disfmarker} industrial designer: like you just grab it , you don't have to s look at it , you know , which way around to point it . Otherwise the design of {disfmarker} or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work . user interface: Even if you designed it {disfmarker} in some {disfmarker} in a way that you know , isn't a rectangle , but still pointed in a direction that had definite points . So if that's your thing and you got something like that instead , marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: and there's your s you kn you know which way you're gonna pointing it . project manager: 'Kay . user interface: Um {disfmarker} marketing: Sorry to interrupt , but we have a warning to finish . project manager: Are we out of time ? industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay , well , just to finish up , should we s go with this plan , start making some {disfmarker} Are good ideas , what are not . industrial designer: Let's . user interface: Does it say {disfmarker} what does it say for n industrial designer: Obviously {disfmarker} user interface: it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , I think . project manager: Uh . Must finish now , so . user interface: T project manager: And then marketing will look and see what uh what people want . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Alright . marketing: Great . project manager: Okay . And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next {vocalsound} time around , be a little bit more prepared . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: And uh alright , good meeting . marketing: {vocalsound}
