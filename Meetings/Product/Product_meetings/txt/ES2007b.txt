project manager: Think we can first {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm . user interface: Right it was function F_ eight or something . industrial designer: Tha user interface: This one right there . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Who is gonna do a PowerPoint presentation ? user interface: Think we all {gap} {disfmarker} industrial designer: You will as well ? user interface: Huh . Oh I thought we all were . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Yeah , I have one too , okay . project manager: {gap} . user interface: S industrial designer: Yep . marketing: {gap} . user interface: Whoops I forgot to put the thing on {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: Right . I just wanna {disfmarker} 'cause basically I can't re I've {disfmarker} really crap at remembering everyone's name so I just wanna {disfmarker} rather than going uh Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that {vocalsound} wanted to know your names again . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Okay I'm {disfmarker} project manager: {gap} just gonna leave this up here 'cause I'll {vocalsound} you know . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Yeah . Sure , that's a good idea . industrial designer: I'm Catherine with a C_ . C_A_T_H_ E_R_ I_N_E_ . project manager: Okay , and user interface: Uh Gabriel . project manager: Gabriel . E_L_ is it ? user interface: E_L_ . project manager: 'Kay . And you're s r R_E_I_S_S_ {vocalsound} {gap} marketing: I am Reissa . R_E_I_S_S_A_ . Double S_ A_ , yeah {vocalsound} yeah . Sorry . project manager: Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: 'S just a bit nicer calling people by their names I think . industrial designer: Right . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: True . project manager: {vocalsound} Uh , right . marketing: Mm 'kay . project manager: Okay , right , welcome to meeting B_ . Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: uh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} I am your Project Manager , and , uh yeah , I'm just here to industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going , get people talking and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically . Um right , this {disfmarker} for the purposes of this meeting {disfmarker} what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , what you've been working on for the last wee while , when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and , you know , filling out silly questionnaires and things . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: But hopefully you've been {disfmarker} actually been doing something productive . So we're gonna {disfmarker} each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation . {vocalsound} Um . marketing: Mm . project manager: Then we're gonna {vocalsound} work , you know , from each of your presentations . We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . Um and then we'll , yeah , we'll {gap} sort of conclude {gap} anything else comes up at the end of it . industrial designer: How long is the meeting ? project manager: This meeting it's not very long . It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now . So I want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that . industrial designer: Okay . {vocalsound} No problem . {vocalsound} project manager: Um if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy , it doesn't matter , it it just it just says that you {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} that's just one particular medium . If you haven't had time to prepare one , you can draw stuff on the noteboard , you can talk to us , you can {disfmarker} you know however you want to do your little presentation , basically , you can . Don't feel pressurised into using this thing . 'Cause I don't . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Uh okay . So um . You okay over there ? Reissa , marketing: I'm fine . Yeah . project manager: are you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here marketing: I uh yeah , yeah . project manager: or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some Internet shopping there ? {vocalsound} user interface: Think she's finishing up her presentation . marketing: D I mean , I I'm finishing off my presentation . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: No no . {vocalsound} Uh I'm done . Okay . project manager: Okay , jolly good . Alright , let's have um {disfmarker} well , we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with . marketing: Mm . project manager: I think the first thing we should look at is um {vocalsound} probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be . So that's gonna be you Catherine , industrial designer: Okay . project manager: if we wanna hear from you first . industrial designer: Okay . Um just connecting this . project manager: You don't have to worry about screwing it in just {disfmarker} industrial designer: Are we getting i Really ? project manager: there you go . industrial designer: Okay . Cool . Okay . So I've got a very quick uh {disfmarker} Uh . Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So the working design , I've got a very quick presentation on this , so um I've {disfmarker} oh no , you can't see a thing . {vocalsound} Oh well , I'm gonna draw it on the board then . It's in blue uh , and I couldn't change it . user interface: Oh . {vocalsound} project manager: Ah . industrial designer: We it's fine on my screen , but never mind . So um {vocalsound} the idea is that we've got the energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well {disfmarker} okay , never mind . So um I think maybe uh two batteries , I dunno what they're called {gap} six , or something like that . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Uh and then {vocalsound} um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh an infra-red signal , um which will be sent by an electronic chip . And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: And uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels . Um and that's it really for the working design . project manager: Great . Okay . industrial designer: Sorry the presentation wasn't very uh clear but {disfmarker} project manager: I prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally . industrial designer: Really ? Cool . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Um , should I erase this or {disfmarker} project manager: Do you wanna just give us a moment , I just wanna copy this down . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Um I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ? industrial designer: Fine . {vocalsound} Or suggestions ? marketing: Is a battery like the only way of {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s user interface: Yeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , you blow on it and i {vocalsound} industrial designer: In indoors . {vocalsound} marketing: No , no {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Bicycle power . marketing: No I meant like {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: No 'cause like cha 'cause {disfmarker} always changing um um batteries can get like annoying . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: The battery's down and {disfmarker} maybe {vocalsound} , I dunno , solar charged ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: I dunno , swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , it's worked for the last fifty years you know . marketing: Mm . Yeah . user interface: One question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream . project manager: How far away is your television ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not {disfmarker} doesn't have to go that far , user interface: Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well , the thing is uh you you don't {disfmarker} project manager: does it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall . user interface: That's true . marketing: Yeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the {disfmarker} put the telephone down , and go into the other room . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . I didn't think about that but {disfmarker} marketing: How about Bluetooth ? {gap} Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth . industrial designer: Why not ? I just think that it's it's gonna cost more marketing: Isn't that a better signal ? project manager: Yeah , yeah I d it sounds like you {gap} you w don't wanna overcomplicate things . industrial designer: and I'm I'm not sure it's {disfmarker} you're gonna use it . marketing: Mm {vocalsound} . project manager: You know we don't need it . industrial designer: It's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you {disfmarker} if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room , project manager: Yeah , exactly . industrial designer: you are gonna {disfmarker} project manager: Basically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit . industrial designer: But {disfmarker} project manager: We're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff . It's uh {disfmarker} marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Oh , we can we can keep the idea if you i We can see at a later stage , maybe , I don't {disfmarker} marketing: 'S just an idea . project manager: Okay . Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Do you need the border ? user interface: Uh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh . industrial designer: Okay . {vocalsound} Sorry . user interface: Technical {gap} . Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: Okay , so , while this is warming up , marketing: Adjusting . user interface: there it is uh . marketing: Yeah . user interface: So I'm doing the user interface design . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um . {gap} we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but {disfmarker} project manager: Mm yeah . user interface: Um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . Um so things that {vocalsound} seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function . project manager: Okay . user interface: Uh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility . And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you {disfmarker} uh . Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um {vocalsound} freeze frame . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Uh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see {vocalsound} what's possible to do , project manager: Yeah . user interface: you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes . project manager: Great . user interface: And I {disfmarker} judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa , marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this . marketing: Mm . project manager: Yeah . marketing: {gap} . {vocalsound} user interface: So uh , yeah , that's me . project manager: Great . Okay . Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units {gap} stuff . Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or {disfmarker} user interface: No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I mean obviously another {disfmarker} {gap} exists {gap} like you like you said in in mobile phones . project manager: Yeah . user interface: That was sort of the inspiration for it . Um I've never seen that with {disfmarker} in in all my years in in the remote business . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: I've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that {gap} a feeling about whether that's really necessary ? project manager: Um {disfmarker} I would say it's {disfmarker} If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be , user interface: Yeah . project manager: even if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes , user interface: Mm-hmm . 'Kay . project manager: it's {gap} like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that , user interface: Right . project manager: but you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred {vocalsound} well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ . user interface: Mm {vocalsound} . project manager: You know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Mm . user interface: Right . And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics . project manager: We put the fashion in electronics . There you go . user interface: I think I think we have to carry that mental . marketing: Mm . project manager: So it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . If if remote control {disfmarker} well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be . user interface: Mm . marketing: Mm . user interface: Well yeah these , I think , we can {disfmarker} so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design . project manager: Yeah . Because we need {disfmarker} user interface: I t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Great . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um . project manager: Okay , fantastic . marketing: Okay . project manager: Right , well done , Gabriel . marketing: {gap} . project manager: Um Reissa . Let's plug you in , baby . marketing: Where does it go into ? user interface: {gap} . marketing: Here ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: The blue thing . user interface: Uh , yeah , this is getting all {gap} . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Mm . {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} . user interface: Yeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up . marketing: Well , function F_ eight . No {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , w it it just takes a wee while . user interface: Yeah , it just takes a second uh . marketing: oh . {vocalsound} Come on . Right . Okay . {gap} . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave {disfmarker} so this is research {disfmarker} and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um {vocalsound} current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . So , they don't like {disfmarker} like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . Um {gap} per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel . project manager: 'Cause we've only got five channels . {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} {vocalsound} exactly . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} That's another thing . {vocalsound} Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like {vocalsound} . project manager: I think that's k flicking quickly between channels . user interface: Yeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Mm . Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . I think especially for uh the older generation . I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . Anyway um and they also {disfmarker} remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them . user interface: Mm . marketing: {vocalsound} So maybe tracking devices is a good idea . project manager: {vocalsound} Wow . marketing: Um personal preferences . {vocalsound} project manager: You are a child of technology , aren't you ? {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um so yeah um {vocalsound} I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . Um {vocalsound} has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . And it's easy to find {vocalsound} , so I don't know whether maybe {disfmarker} and also we asked them whether they wanted {vocalsound} {disfmarker} whether they'd be interested in um {vocalsound} voice activating . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: So voice activation . So and this was what we came up with . Then if you look fifteen to twenty five {disfmarker} this is age , sorry , {gap} age groups . So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two {disfmarker} ninety one per cent of them said yes . project manager: So there you go , yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh but do the younger generation have the money ? They they don't . user interface: No I would I would say the older the older people , yeah . project manager: It's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and {disfmarker} marketing: Well the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent {gap} say no , so {disfmarker} project manager: People people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: For people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . Um but no they're not {gap} sort of {disfmarker} most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , user interface: Yeah , that would be my guess as well . project manager: uh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years . marketing: So they don't {disfmarker} project manager: Um {vocalsound} d and tha marketing: Well {disfmarker} project manager: and that's a {vocalsound} that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent . marketing: These guys are growing up . {vocalsound} user interface: What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit . project manager: Yeah . user interface: I mean , okay , there's {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Voice activation might not be the best . project manager: I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off . user interface: Uh . marketing: Um also with um with buttons , {vocalsound} a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: Repetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury marketing: Huh ? user interface: or like from doing {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , repetitive strains injury , so they don't {disfmarker} I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well {vocalsound} maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} I don't think so . {vocalsound} project manager: So y so it's so it's so you got {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: so that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah {vocalsound} user interface: Mm . marketing: maybe not so hard . user interface: Mm . project manager: see {vocalsound} have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this . industrial designer: Maybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Let's jus {gap} marketing: Maybe {disfmarker} project manager: we just want {disfmarker} need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury . user interface: Yeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh . marketing: Mm . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} They're having a lunch break at the moment , but {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: I'll see if I can get {disfmarker} see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting . user interface: Yeah . I think we can do some really {disfmarker} in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Mm . Maybe th the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much , user interface: Mm . marketing: or we just like flat buttons , something . Yeah . project manager: Okay . marketing: So that is me . project manager: That's great , thank you very much for that , Reissa . {vocalsound} Um okay , so we've basically we've decide we've d we've decided that it's gonna be , you know uh , we're going for a basic television remote . It's gotta be safe to use , it's gotta look cool . marketing: Mm . project manager: It's gotta be cheap . S um . marketing: Mm . project manager: Now going back to the uh industrial design of it , you know , we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth . I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , uh and that would be infra-red , energy source , that would be batteries . Uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . Um . {vocalsound} But a in {disfmarker} there's no I don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years , because technology will have changed and , you know , we won't have televisions in ten years' time . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yep . project manager: I think we're all um pretty sussed on that . Um anyone have any questions ? Everybody happy in their work ? marketing: Mm . user interface: Yeah , it seems like we're all on the {disfmarker} pretty much on the same page . project manager: Now {gap} this is good , we've got a good structure going on . We all know where we're going to . {vocalsound} Have you been ge has {disfmarker} have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers ? user interface: Oh it's probably just you , 'cause you're the project manager . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {gap} . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Well , just questionnaires . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Sell {disfmarker} trying to sell your things {gap} . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , {gap} stuff . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Um okay . Do {disfmarker} oh {gap} have you guys found out if we can if we can e-mail stuff to each other ? marketing: Yeah , you can . project manager: Right . Do all you all know my e-mail address ? user interface: Okay . No I don't . I {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well , in the project announcement , you've got the addresses , I think . marketing: I think he's participant one , aren't you ? industrial designer: So Project Manager , it's participant one at A_M_I_ . {vocalsound} user interface: Uh {disfmarker} Oh , it's just participant one oh okay . Yeah . project manager: Can you all d e-mail me your e-mail addresses ? marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} {gap} . industrial designer: You have them i you have them , user interface: Well it's just w it's just it's just par participant one , participant two . {vocalsound} industrial designer: but we'll send you an e-mail . project manager: Send me , yeah industrial designer: You want to have friends , don't you ? project manager: {disfmarker} yeah , okay . user interface: {vocalsound} So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as {gap} maybe that's our next meeting that we discuss that . project manager: {vocalsound} Is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue ? I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background , but I might be just going a bit {disfmarker} user interface: Well , it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white {disfmarker} with yellow borders . project manager: Okay . user interface: Maybe that's {vocalsound} like getting ahead of ourselves . project manager: Well , maybe you can come up with a few {disfmarker} with a couple of different ideas ? industrial designer: It wouldn't be {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . marketing: Can't we have different colours in the remotes , so somebody can choose different col project manager: Well , see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company image . marketing: like does it have to be of a certain ? user interface: Mm . project manager: It's gotta say {disfmarker} people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's a Real Reaction i product . user interface: Mm . marketing: But if it's a R_R_ , it would be Real Reaction , project manager: There's loads of companies that called R_R_ . marketing: like if it had a symbol on it . user interface: Mm . project manager: This is slog {gap} but this is the slogan , this is the the the the type . marketing: Whoa . user interface: And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , project manager: Yeah . user interface: so , I mean , we are sort of beholden to them . marketing: So we have to have it one colour . project manager: Well , not necessarily . But we have to incorporate it . user interface: Not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable . marketing: Mm . project manager: Not necessarily even if i it just has to {disfmarker} ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products industrial designer: Well you could {disfmarker} project manager: as opposed to a Sony product or a , you know , a Panasonic product . marketing: Mm . project manager: It's got to {disfmarker} so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps . industrial designer: It could come {disfmarker} But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} like just around the lock button could be the R_R_ logo or colours and {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: If {gap} . project manager: Quite poss yeah . Well this is all your department . Mm okay . Well , well done everybody . user interface: {gap} . project manager: And um , I think we uh stop for lunch now . user interface: Yeah , pretty soon I think , I guess that's now . marketing: Are we are we finished ahead of schedule ? project manager: We might possibly have done . industrial designer: Cool . user interface: Alright , see you all soon . project manager: {vocalsound} If we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish , then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch . marketing: {vocalsound} 'Kay uh . project manager: Yeah , there you go . Right . I just have to {disfmarker} there's a few little bits and pieces I have to write down , but {disfmarker} Take your headsets off , kick back , smoke 'em if you got 'em . {vocalsound}
