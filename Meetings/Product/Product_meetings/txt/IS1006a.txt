user interface: Oops . project manager: So , hello everyone . {vocalsound} We're here to have a kick-off meeting for the design of a {disfmarker} f for the beginning of new project um {vocalsound} uh remote control for the design for a new remote control {vocalsound} . I'm the Project Manager Christa Pavlov and {vocalsound} okay let's begin . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} So I'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan , some discussion and then we talk of uh the next meeting . So um we want to to do a new remote control . It has to be original , trendy and user friendly . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Um I think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it's functional design , it's conceptual design , and desail detailed design . {gap} and for that we're going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day . Um , so {vocalsound} let's try the whiteboard {vocalsound} . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wow . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Um so any of you who want to go . user interface: Yeah , for favourite animals . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: It's gonna be not my favourite one but the one I can draw . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} And it's gonna be {disfmarker} you'll try to guess . marketing: Wow . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Complex . project manager: Wow . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Huh ? A cat . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: No . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: No . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: No . Darn . {vocalsound} Uh . project manager: A rabbit . user interface: Yes , that's a rabbit . project manager: {vocalsound} A rabbit . user interface: That's my favourite one . marketing: A what ? industrial designer: Rabbit . marketing: A r a rabbit , oh oh yeah , where is the carrot ? {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} That's it . marketing: Okay {vocalsound} mm-hmm . project manager: You want to go ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: I am not very good at uh {vocalsound} this kind of stuff . user interface: Hmm . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: My favourite animal is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} You wa marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Wow . {vocalsound} project manager: A human industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Guess . project manager: {vocalsound} ah . marketing: {vocalsound} A human , yay . It's a very complex animal {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: No . marketing: and um {disfmarker} yeah . Characteristics of this this animal is {vocalsound} dangerous . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Mm I think you're supposed to , yeah . industrial designer: Is the white {disfmarker} okay . project manager: Hmm . industrial designer: I guess you can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Wow . That's cobra . marketing: Ah , a kind of uh snake ? Cobra ? industrial designer: Yeah uh not really . marketing: Exactly {vocalsound} . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Small cobra . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: No , it just {disfmarker} small cobra , yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Is that a worm ? Or {vocalsound} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Uh-huh . {vocalsound} user interface: It's co c quite recognisable . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} What about you uh {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Uh yeah Christa Pavlov {vocalsound} Mm . marketing: Christa ? {vocalsound} user interface: Christa {vocalsound} Christa . industrial designer: Chris . {vocalsound} marketing: A fish . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm . user interface: Hmm . project manager: Smiling fish {vocalsound} . industrial designer: Smile fish . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: A smiling fish . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: So , w whiteboard is working ? {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Good . {vocalsound} Next . {vocalsound} project manager: Next . Let's talk about money . user interface: Just tr try to guess who is a User Interface Designer . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , well . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} According to the drawings . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , you're {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Not me . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} So . marketing: So . Twenty five Euro for a remote control . project manager: Yeah , mm that's the price we want to {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: that's the aim for the price for the remote control . marketing: Okay . project manager: We aim to do {vocalsound} this profit . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} On the international market . marketing: {vocalsound} 'tis big number . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah , we're to sell two million then . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Wow . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Mm {vocalsound} for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum . {vocalsound} 'Kay {vocalsound} . So any of you have experience in remote controls ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm yeah . marketing: Uh yes , we have plenty at home . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} In fact , my daughter likes l {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} remote controls . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} That {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . To eat ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: To eat ? Yeah , mainly , and to break . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So that could be a great um {vocalsound} application . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Remote controls children proof . Mm mm-hmm . marketing: Mm-hmm . Yeah . user interface: Children proof . marketing: {vocalsound} Ye ye yeah . user interface: Hmm . marketing: So she likes uh buttons {vocalsound} which make click , project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: Yeah , pret project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: so {vocalsound} it has to click . project manager: So they have to be waterproof maybe ? marketing: It has to be uh wha {vocalsound} baby proof {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} 'Cause they eat {disfmarker} she ate it . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: yeah {vocalsound} but mainly it has to be very robust project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: because even if she's not very tall she's uh {vocalsound} high enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Ah . marketing: So it has to be very robust . user interface: Okay , unbreakable . marketing: Unbreakable , yeah . user interface: Uh-huh . industrial designer: Yeah , we have some child lock or something , yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: And uh {vocalsound} it has to be nice looking , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: colourful , maybe {disfmarker} project manager: Colourful , yeah mm . user interface: Colourful ? That's not practical . marketing: colourful , because uh nobody has colourful remote control industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: No , that's a good idea . industrial designer: Yeah , it's always black or {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: , they're always black , yeah , project manager: Mm mm-mm . user interface: No . marketing: but this one could be I dunno , purple or b project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: But how gonna {disfmarker} okay , just uh but it's uh monochrome it's n it's not like {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , yeah . project manager: No , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: because you think , why not . user interface: Otherwise you will never find it . marketing: One colour . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah even we can change colours , no ? Like the uh marketing: Oh like the phones , industrial designer: like the phones and these things we c yeah . marketing: yeah , it could change colours , yeah . user interface: Cool . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: At least for children like one colour and {gap} . {vocalsound} user interface: Ch marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Good idea . marketing: Good . industrial designer: And it should be really {gap} small and {gap} . project manager: Small also ? Don't you think {disfmarker} industrial designer: Huh not so big like {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: No uh , not too much buttons or {disfmarker} mm . industrial designer: Yeah , not too much buttons and {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Should it be , y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television , then it's the remote control for the the sound system , or for your refrigerator industrial designer: Uh . Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} whatever {vocalsound} project manager: that's {disfmarker} marketing: I dunno if it's {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Or if we should have a targeted re remote control . project manager: Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} So colour , robustness , easy to use , size , project manager: So , I think there's {disfmarker} marketing: yeah , size matters , yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . Colour , {vocalsound} size , sh project manager: So you you think it's better if small than bigger . industrial designer: Yeah , maybe at least n not bigger than this I guess . {vocalsound} marketing: Mm . user interface: Yeah , but without any extremes like n not of this size , not too large . Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: No , not too small , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah yeah , at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like {gap} . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Hmm . user interface: Yeah , like a palm sized . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Just to hold it . marketing: Mm . project manager: Okay . marketing: But uh what would be different from this , from the others ? I dunno if {vocalsound} {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh maybe we can change the colours that {disfmarker} at least the frame . Mm . S so then it depends {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , at least the colour would be different . industrial designer: you are to {disfmarker} project manager: Mm . industrial designer: Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame {gap} . marketing: I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're {disfmarker} they never find a good button in the right place . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . marketing: For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow , project manager: Mm . So , some kind of idea uh with um um {vocalsound} cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what {disfmarker} marketing: I dunno {gap} . user interface: No , project manager: no . user interface: no screens , it's too complex . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Mm . {vocalsound} Too expensive , yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Too expensive for twelve Euro ? user interface: And n maybe not too expensive , project manager: And too expensive . user interface: well it's not my problem , but well okay . marketing: Ah . user interface: But no screens on remote controls . project manager: Mm . marketing: Mm-hmm . I thought it could be only a screen {vocalsound} which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right , industrial designer: Ye yeah . marketing: so I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control , industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: if you {disfmarker} if you like . industrial designer: I mean it it's like marketing: I don't know if it makes sense , but {disfmarker} project manager: Mm-mm . industrial designer: {disfmarker} it's like two types no ? {vocalsound} people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this , say if you're right handed you use like this marketing: Yeah , for instance , mm . user interface: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . project manager: Mm-hmm . Mm mm mm . industrial designer: or {disfmarker} so tha your switch on and off should be on marketing: Mm . project manager: So adaptable {vocalsound} {disfmarker} yeah something {disfmarker} user interface: Adaptable . Alright , good , industrial designer: {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: Maybe , if if it's possible , yeah . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: Mm {vocalsound} user interface: so how many actions do we need to implement in it ? industrial designer: huh . user interface: On off ? industrial designer: Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: We can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations . user interface: I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a industrial designer: Two . marketing: Three buttons you mean ? user interface: {vocalsound} like three mental states , project manager: Three option . user interface: yeah you know what I mean , marketing: Ah . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: we can just make it uh industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . project manager: Um . user interface: controlled by a brain , huh ? {vocalsound} project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm , yeah , sure . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Maybe if it's more , if there is a software inside industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: that ask you three {disfmarker} user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} If it {disfmarker} if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah . user interface: Sh sure , sure . marketing: Yeah , more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time . industrial designer: Mm yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else . marketing: Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have {disfmarker} you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five . industrial designer: Mm . Yeah . project manager: Mm . {vocalsound} marketing: And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five . {vocalsound} user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: You do this ? industrial designer: Yeah {vocalsound} . marketing: Uh no . user interface: I usually just change channels . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Because I'm only using three or four channels but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put {disfmarker} yeah , you can only have one bit . project manager: Yeah . I change channel like this , m uh I want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh-huh mm yeah . industrial designer: Dash . marketing: And then back to the one I was before , project manager: Also we can be here {disfmarker} marketing: so there's {disfmarker} whichever it was . user interface: Uh-huh . industrial designer: Yeah you can project manager: yeah , that would be cool . industrial designer: {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: Go back button is good . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . Uh uh we had that in in other countries . user interface: I once had it . industrial designer: Yeah yeah , the previous button is {gap} . project manager: Mm {vocalsound} yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo {vocalsound} previous of the previous . {vocalsound} user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Uh , okay . {vocalsound} user interface: History . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Oh {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Then you can watch what your {disfmarker} ah you could also record your {disfmarker} record your {vocalsound} sequence of actions , industrial designer: Uh . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} that becomes more complex , project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} remote controls . industrial designer: Yeah yeah , what the {disfmarker} which channels the viewer {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Mm-mm . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: maybe it's a {disfmarker} project manager: So I think we have full of idea . marketing: Okay . project manager: Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm {vocalsound} work on these ideas and try to make a uh {vocalsound} the ones , {vocalsound} make um {disfmarker} to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want . {vocalsound} And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do . Um . {vocalsound} So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes . marketing: So what does M_E_ means ? M_E_ the user requirements ? Or that's uh that's for us ? user interface: Market Expert . project manager: Mm . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Marketing {disfmarker} yeah {vocalsound} {gap} . marketing: Uh that's me . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Oh , of course {vocalsound} yeah , the user requirement specifications , uh-huh , yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Okay . {vocalsound} I'll think of that . project manager: Mm okay . So . marketing: So ? project manager: I think that's all . marketing: Meeting's over ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: Okay . marketing: Great . industrial designer: Thank you . marketing: Thank you . project manager: See you in thirty minutes . user interface: Thank you everybody .
