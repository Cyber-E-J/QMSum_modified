project manager: Um we are {disfmarker} So the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . So {gap} switching over I've just left uh my first two screens {gap} . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Um {vocalsound} mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time . user interface: Okay . Cool . project manager: {vocalsound} Um and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ? N user interface: Mm um . No , I don't think so . project manager: No ? Okay , cool . industrial designer: No . project manager: Then we shall start with a presentation from Raj . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} Hi , me Raj , again . Uh in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching , uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . So we have to look on this . First of all methodology . The met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . So what are our findings ? In our {vocalsound} uh in our findings we have seen that {disfmarker} when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel uh good . So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls . So we should take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor . So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take {disfmarker} in designing our rem uh remote controls . user interface: The last one is the most important one , is it ? marketing: No the first one is the user interface: Oh , sorry . marketing: uh the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook , project manager: {gap} user interface: Okay . marketing: the fancy design uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good . user interface: Okay . marketing: The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative . We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are . So it uh should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: So that indicates our technological advancement . And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: like it shouldn't be too much co complicated , user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi uh remote control , it shouldn't be too complicated uh like this way . And it should be uh {disfmarker} and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . So that they could know how to use these remote controls . When we did uh f fashions uh , recent fashion uh {disfmarker} our recent fashion update shows that {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Sorry . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Ah yeah ? {vocalsound} user interface: I was just reading fruit and vegetables . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Hard to know how we are going to incorporate that . {vocalsound} marketing: Y yeah uh yeah , we have to , because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , {gap} and everything with fruits and vegetables , project manager: {gap} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic , becoming more and more organic , user interface: Okay . Yeah . industrial designer: We should make a big sponge lemon , marketing: becoming {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: and then it'd be it would be yellow . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: It's {disfmarker} marketing: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Th that's very good . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . So something like that we we should do . user interface: Glow-in-the-dark . Okay . marketing: And people uh the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look . industrial designer: Mm . {vocalsound} user interface: Well , that's good . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . user interface: That's what we kind of predicted anyway . marketing: So so that they could play with it while handi uh while handling it . So that should also be taken into consideration . user interface: Okay . Okay . marketing: So these are my views . user interface: Okay . marketing: So {disfmarker} user interface: Okay , the spongy , not real spongy , you can {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: No it ca {vocalsound} y a {gap} {disfmarker} user interface: Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ? marketing: The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co user interface: Okay . Quite disposable . marketing: Yeah . 'Cause we It shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also , user interface: Okay . marketing: because our company is very well {gap} for taking all these concerns into consideration , project manager: Alright , okay . user interface: Oh okay . marketing: so we don't want to have any harm to the society , user interface: Uh-huh . Okay . marketing: so {disfmarker} project manager: Fashion . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Mm 'kay . user interface: Cool . marketing: So that's all . {vocalsound} project manager: Fruit and veg , well there you go . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Just what I think of when I think of a remote control . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: Mm . industrial designer: {gap} user interface: A remote control ? Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} {gap} user interface: And were there any factors that weren't important in the survey , that they said we don't want ? marketing: S uh we didn't find out any such point . user interface: Or was it just {disfmarker} Okay . {vocalsound} marketing: Uh yes , there could be , but we couldn't find out any , so {disfmarker} project manager: Mm-mm-mm-mm . user interface: Cool . project manager: Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm . user interface: F_ , what is it ? Um . project manager: Function F_ eight . user interface: {gap} yeah . project manager: Hmm . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: {gap} marketing: Yeah . {gap} project manager: {gap} marketing: Oh no , {vocalsound} {gap} . user interface: No signal . Is that {gap} ? industrial designer: No , it's got it's got it . marketing: Yeah , uh yeah , uh yeah . industrial designer: {gap} marketing: {gap} Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Excuse me . user interface: Okay , and then F_ five , right ? project manager: Uh , yeah {gap} . user interface: Okay . Um okay , so the interface concept um . Yeah . The interface specification , what people {disfmarker} um how they interact with it basically , I think . Um so the method , we looked at existing designs , what are the {disfmarker} what's good about them , what's bad about them , um I looked at their flaws , so we're going to look at their flaws , everything . Um and what {vocalsound} the survey told us and what we think would be good , so a bit of imagination . project manager: Mm 'kay . user interface: {vocalsound} Uh the findings , I've got some pictures to show you as well . project manager: {vocalsound} {gap} either . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Hmm . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something . project manager: Uh okay . user interface: Um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing . So I think for our remote control {disfmarker} There is some inconsistency already in {disfmarker} ec existing in {disfmarker} between remote controls , but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something , project manager: Right , okay . Yeah . user interface: I think , people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: And we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you . project manager: Excellent . user interface: Do I press Escape F_ five ? Or just {disfmarker} project manager: Uh no just escape should uh {disfmarker} user interface: Escape , okay . Um , oh I still haven't got my glasses on . Yeah , okay . So these are the {disfmarker} some of the pictures of existing ones . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Wow . user interface: I'll just walk you through them . This one is a voice recognition . project manager: 'Kay . user interface: And that's the kind of idea we're going for . project manager: Looks pretty complicated . user interface: There's um an L_C_D_ thing , which we thought could {disfmarker} I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . project manager: Right , okay . user interface: This one is {disfmarker} got a kind of scroll like a mouse , project manager: Mm-hmm , like the middle button . user interface: which {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: Okay . user interface: Um and {disfmarker} But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Ah it's kinda like scrolling {disfmarker} user interface: like would the computer come {disfmarker} project manager: uh right , well , if I s if I'm thinking of the right one , I've got the same thing in front of my monitor , you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um {vocalsound} menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll . user interface: Uh-huh , that's like the L_C_D_ one , project manager: Right , okay . user interface: is it ? But the one below that has got like {vocalsound} a little scroll function on the side . But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Yeah , presumably . user interface: I think that's what that is . So these are just a few ideas . Again that's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one . industrial designer: Uh it looks threatening . project manager: Yeah , looks like uh looks like something out of a jet . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , it does look kind of dangerous . industrial designer: {vocalsound} It looks like yeah {gap} . marketing: Hmm . user interface: Um this one I thought was really cool . It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: You can put it in there , it's for your kids , and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool . project manager: Okay . user interface: And that's really easy to use , bright , so I like this one lot for our design . I think something like that would be good . industrial designer: Wow . project manager: Yeah , I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um {vocalsound} , I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing . user interface: Of course yellow . {vocalsound} project manager: So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever . user interface: Right , yeah . Yeah , that's true . Yeah . Um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something . And this one , the over-sized one , I don't know about you , but I think it's a bit too gimmicky . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: I don't think that will sell very well . project manager: I mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something , is it ? {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} I guess so . I don't know . industrial designer: Then d blind don't watch T_V_ . {vocalsound} project manager: Strange . {vocalsound} user interface: I think that's a bit {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah exactly . project manager: No they do , they do . industrial designer: They do ? {vocalsound} project manager: They listen to it . Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . And um this one {vocalsound} is just pointing out . I like {vocalsound} some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything , but {gap} pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape . project manager: Right , okay . user interface: So that could {disfmarker} that's a bit confusing . Um but the buttons on this I think are {disfmarker} it's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons . They don't have to be all the same . So that's quite cool . Um . project manager: 'Kay but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , don't they ? user interface: Yeah , exactly . Um F_ five . Yes . So there are some of the findings . So we need to combine those ones um industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: and I've just got {vocalsound} an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . project manager: Brilliant . That's handy . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: Um yeah it is , just in time , very handy . Um so {vocalsound} I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good . project manager: Okay . user interface: It's {disfmarker} you program it like you say , record , um and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , so that's {disfmarker} And it's much {disfmarker} Yeah . So that's quite cool . Uh personal preferences just some imagination , the raised symbols I thought were good , the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget , do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} industrial designer: The L_C_D_ user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and the other stuff uh , I think . user interface: And the speech recognition , 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition , marketing: But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , user interface: are we ? marketing: but they want the quality , they want f fancy look , they want some new design , something new . user interface: Uh-huh . project manager: Okay . marketing: Uh yeah . user interface: Uh-huh . But our budget , we've {disfmarker} project manager: It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: So even if we increase our cost little bit , within uh some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook , I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market . user interface: Uh-huh . Okay . project manager: Okay . user interface: I'm not sure if the {disfmarker} if {vocalsound} for twenty five Euros uh per uh twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost , {gap} . industrial designer: Ben bana project manager: Yeah . I can't see tha Although , th I mean to be to be sure they have got {disfmarker} I mean they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now , industrial designer: {gap} user interface: The L_C_D_ . project manager: so that you've got your L_C_D_ T_V_s and everything so maybe the small {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: But I mean like I I {disfmarker} the black and white , I guess , it just doesn't look funky enough . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Um but , I mean , like even mobile phones or whatever have {disfmarker} now have colour L_C_D_ screens , user interface: No . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: w I ju I mean user interface: Yeah . S project manager: I wouldn't know about the costs of them . user interface: Uh-huh . industrial designer: But uh price price not withstanding um , is it too complicated , is it gonna be too much just overload ? marketing: And the {disfmarker} project manager: Twelve fifty . marketing: Uh i it will be easy because there will be , on L_C_D_ s screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click ok okay , whatever they wa project manager: {vocalsound} Possibly . user interface: Yeah , that's the thing , because {disfmarker} industrial designer: But but the thing is when you use a remote control , you never look at it , right ? You're looking at the T_V_ project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and and it's uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . user interface: That's true , yeah . industrial designer: It just seems kind of like a a needless th user interface: And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_ . project manager: Right . user interface: It's a it's great , it's a good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , I think . Child-friendly , I thought this was good , as you pointed out the um {vocalsound} the bit , it often goes missing especially with children , but it's a good shape and the organic is kind of {disfmarker} we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , I think . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: So which vegetable ? {vocalsound} project manager: Well I mean we could make a {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , I know , carrot {vocalsound} . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay . {vocalsound} project manager: Well , si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon wasn't that far s {vocalsound} industrial designer: The the lemon . Well what are the options ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: And if it doesn't work you know , we've just made a lemon . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: But we don't want it to be {disfmarker} Yeah . Um the child-friendly , yeah . Easy to use , it seems quite easy to use . I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff . project manager: Mm-hmm . I like I like the colourful buttons as well . user interface: I think that's a good idea to go for . Yeah . And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea , because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . Um . project manager: Yeah . I mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five , user interface: Yeah . project manager: so most people will have come in contact with that kind of use . user interface: S yeah . So they'd be able to use that um , as I said I think i I'd presume it would come up on the screen . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Um so there you go . project manager: And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the T_V_ maker , so {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Oh . user interface: So that's um the user interface project manager: 'Kay . user interface: design . project manager: {vocalsound} {gap} industrial designer: Okay . user interface: So okay , I'll take this out now then . industrial designer: Um so project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: There you go . industrial designer: I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among , project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , looks like it . industrial designer: and I'll I'll give you the uh , {vocalsound} I guess , technical considerations for those . user interface: Mm . project manager: {vocalsound} Uh {vocalsound} user interface: {gap} industrial designer: And I'm gonna use the whiteboard , just 'cause we haven't used it {vocalsound} . project manager: Yeah , I was just thinking the self same thing . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Right . So , the way I'm gonna do this {vocalsound} is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it , project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: and then we'll throw in our new innovations um {vocalsound} and keep it all within budget . project manager: {vocalsound} Magic man . industrial designer: So uh yeah , looking inside a a very simple remote control . Um this is what they sent me . 'Kay . Here's uh the competition , I suppose . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: um {vocalsound} and there's a a chip , a processor , the T_A_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , and ch project manager: So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ? industrial designer: Right , it's very {disfmarker} they're very cheap remote . This remote costs nothing , you know . Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light , which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television . project manager: Right . industrial designer: Oh here it is . {vocalsound} Um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , because it it defines the uh {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ? industrial designer: R Um no , I mean this is a very old one , so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make . project manager: They gotta be {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Almost a key-ring . {gap} industrial designer: Right . So this is what we need to have for certain . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: Um . So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be , um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up , processor , um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard . Um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team uh , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , um latex , double-curved , curved . So lots of choices , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: 'Kay . industrial designer: what do we think ? Uh or sponge , I guess , isn't on there , right . project manager: Well . user interface: Mm . I'm not sure about the sponge . industrial designer: Organic sponge . {vocalsound} project manager: Well , I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , doesn't it . industrial designer: Uh yeah , it's very elasticy for sure . project manager: Um {disfmarker} Yeah . And that would k also give it kinda durability user interface: Yeah . project manager: and user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Um . project manager: and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast . industrial designer: Yeah so {disfmarker} project manager: Um {vocalsound} so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic {disfmarker} initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? industrial designer: Okay so , here are a a plastic , uh latex {disfmarker} user interface: I like the rubber , the stress balls , I think , project manager: Oh right , okay . user interface: you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and {disfmarker} industrial designer: Oh right . project manager: I don't know what that stuff is . {vocalsound} industrial designer: So something with give to it . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay . And user interface: And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around . industrial designer: and the colour is yellow , right ? user interface: Yeah , project manager: Or at least incorporating , yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: y {vocalsound} yellow incorporated , yeah . industrial designer: Yellow {vocalsound} , okay . Um . project manager: I mean I forgot i we're sort of uh {disfmarker} I don't know what other standard silver kind of {disfmarker} user interface: I think {disfmarker} project manager: Other parts or uh {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . Yeah , the buttons w like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Mm' kay . user interface: or i if we're having buttons actually , industrial designer: So yellow for the body , user interface: I don project manager: Um . industrial designer: and then what colour for the buttons ? project manager: Um I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So multi-coloured buttons . user interface: You do have ones like um play {vocalsound} could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah . industrial designer: {gap} project manager: Yeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps . user interface: {vocalsound} Makes it easy to use . Yeah , that's true , because that blue one did look quite hardish . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well . I mean if we are gonna make it a novel {disfmarker} I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . project manager: a bit comfier , you know . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go {disfmarker} Um how exactly ? Maybe double {disfmarker} user interface: Like uh {vocalsound} an hour glass kind of figure , is that what you're thinking of , project manager: Yeah it's uh , yeah , that that'd be {disfmarker} that's sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you don't drop it . user interface: or just like a {disfmarker} It's not {disfmarker} industrial designer: What about a banana ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} We could make novelty remote controls . industrial designer: Yeah ? Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , project manager: Well , yeah , I mean like {disfmarker} industrial designer: 'cause it's yellow fruit , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: right ? project manager: Yeah , yeah . Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . But then how would you point it ? marketing: Ah industrial designer: {gap} marketing: yeah . Mm-hmm . user interface: How would you point it ? industrial designer: Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point , I guess . user interface: What {disfmarker} industrial designer: We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , I appreciate this idea , project manager: They only cost pennies . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: because then this {disfmarker} {vocalsound} this will help us in our advertisement also project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices . That what our data shows that , so this w this w user interface: Yeah . project manager: Huh ? user interface: {gap} y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Um . industrial designer: So a spongy banana re {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} I mean that that th {vocalsound} user interface: Rubber banana . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: does user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: Okay , okay . user interface: I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . And what else did you say about fashions ? What was trendy ? marketing: Uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , project manager: {vocalsound} S industrial designer: See {disfmarker} marketing: like people uh now {disfmarker} project manager: And sponginess . industrial designer: So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable user interface: And spongy , yeah . marketing: Spongy . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: like so it would have a stem perhaps user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and a user interface: Maybe , yeah . industrial designer: maybe a {disfmarker} it'd be s axially symmetric . project manager: Huh . user interface: Like what's what's that {vocalsound} , I don't even know the name of it , some kind of , you know where it's like {disfmarker} looks like a little snowman kind of thing . I don't know the name of that . industrial designer: So it'd look like this kinda . user interface: Yeah , that's what I was thinking . industrial designer: Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? project manager: Uh . user interface: Yeah , maybe that's what they are . project manager: {gap} user interface: 'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: and {disfmarker} industrial designer: and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end . user interface: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , why the hell not . {vocalsound} Let's {vocalsound} that'll make us fifty million Euros . user interface: I don't know . What do you guy {disfmarker} What do you think ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Um . Well , I guess it's kind of dra uh you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , user interface: No . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: yeah ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , then only we can relate it with something . project manager: Yeah , we can relate it by advertising or {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . Exactly . industrial designer: Okay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ? project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . user interface: Uh-huh . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: There's a good man . There's a good idea . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Okay um , I guess , since you're the marketing guy . marketing: Yeah , sure . I will be happy to do that . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: We'll uh {disfmarker} Okay , we could do that . Um . user interface: Okay . And buttons would , did we say ? Uh different shapes of buttons ? industrial designer: {gap} project manager: Um I l I su I mean for the specific functions , you know , up and down , uh play , stop . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Okay , so project manager: They've got , I mean , they've got standard sort of intuitive um industrial designer: so buttons . project manager: things that are always used . industrial designer: Okay , just like that . user interface: {gap} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} That's cool . user interface: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} I like it . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Um . {vocalsound} industrial designer: With the scroll-wheel or no ? user interface: Yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? {vocalsound} project manager: Uh speech recognition , I think , so we need a microphone presumably . industrial designer: Okay uh I could put the microphone here . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Okay there's the microphone . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Where should I put the microphone ? project manager: I mean ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ? user interface: Yeah , I'm not sure . Um I mean those ideas I saw were just for inspiration , I think . project manager: {vocalsound} Glad , we're not doing this for real . user interface: Um yeah , I can {disfmarker} no I'm not sure . industrial designer: Okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ? user interface: I couldn Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: And uh I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is {gap} the microphone {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or {disfmarker} project manager: I would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it's {disfmarker} Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: 'Kay there's the mic . project manager: So it can be sort of held and w {gap} {vocalsound} user interface: That's cool . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {disfmarker} We really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition . industrial designer: Um n well we can {disfmarker} Whoops . {vocalsound} project manager: Oops . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Um . project manager: Um . user interface: So let's not use the whiteboard any more . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Um . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Upsidaisy . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Oops , sorry . Okay . user interface: And uh so what else was there ? Um the {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: What about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ? project manager: {vocalsound} I s I still like it . user interface: Are we just gonna leave that ? project manager: Um but that's me . {vocalsound} user interface: You still like it . 'Cause we've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system . industrial designer: Right . project manager: Yes , or maybe it's just going a bit uh too far . I mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes . user interface: 'Cause um it could {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: Um don't wanna sort of overkill . user interface: Especially with yellow {vocalsound} . {vocalsound} Mm . I dunno . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: 'Cause I mean like uh if we {disfmarker} I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ? Do we want to go for buttons at all , do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ? {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Then you put it in the fruit bowl ? industrial designer: {gap} {gap} {vocalsound} They can work from a {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , you know , and then you just tal industrial designer: You don't have to hold it . project manager: I mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers , project manager: {vocalsound} Um . {vocalsound} industrial designer: you know they have uh fruits all round them . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . Make them make them think of fruit , yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Now just make sure they don't eat the remote . marketing: Yeah . project manager: I mean uh {vocalsound} some uh I user interface: Yeah , do we need buttons ? project manager: l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , I dunno , an apple . user interface: Mm . project manager: Then it's just apple so sort of {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Uh , yellow apples though {disfmarker} Hmm . {vocalsound} user interface: I quite like the shape . I quite like the design of that , uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite {disfmarker} got a quite steady base . industrial designer: {gap} project manager: Yeah . Okay , yeah , that's good . industrial designer: Okay . But yeah {disfmarker} project manager: Groovy . user interface: Um project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know . project manager: Yeah , {gap} . {vocalsound} industrial designer: But yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close . user interface: {gap} industrial designer: It can sit at a distance and pick it up still . project manager: Yeah . So {vocalsound} I mean like you could actually {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . marketing: Or we can {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , gives you the options . marketing: we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: So whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: So a selection of casings . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: it will look l {vocalsound} Uh yeah . In that w project manager: It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , 'cause you said about disposable , marketing: S s sorry ? user interface: didn't you ? You said about disposable earli people want disposable things marketing: Uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover , project manager: {gap} user interface: so we could do that , like have a choice . Yeah . marketing: okay ? If somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look . project manager: Like like mobiles , yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put {disfmarker} we will put apple shape casing on that . It will give apple shape look . So in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want , user interface: Okay . project manager: {gap} user interface: Okay . marketing: without {disfmarker} uh yeah . user interface: We still need the buttons in the same places thought , marketing: Yeah , button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . user interface: don't we ? project manager: You can standardise those , I mean . user interface: {gap} marketing: Yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , user interface: Oh , that's the other side . Oh , okay . marketing: so half of that will be look the {disfmarker} user interface: Oh , half a fruit . Oh , okay , okay . marketing: Yeah , not not the upper side . So from lower you can , it means while you are holding of {disfmarker} from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever . user interface: Okay , okay . marketing: So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . industrial designer: Yeah yeah . marketing: And {disfmarker} project manager: I think tho I think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , user interface: Okay . project manager: 'cause when {disfmarker} if you think about it if they're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . It doesn't really {disfmarker} user interface: Mm mm . project manager: You know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it , user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: unless you have sort of {disfmarker} you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down . And you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the {disfmarker} user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Maybe . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} Okay , um so {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options . industrial designer: Yeah , marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: s I guess we decided on material , right ? So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and the colours we got down , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: and the shape , maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . Well , um because {disfmarker} Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and uh because {vocalsound} what {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , so we stick with what we've got there . user interface: Yeah , w I think wh wha would {disfmarker} we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a {disfmarker} too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , project manager: Mm 'kay . user interface: because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} user interface: I mean we could make it nice pale yellow . project manager: Well , it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow . {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: So again I mean like we could have , uh I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different user interface: Okay . Yeah . project manager: colour , but have {disfmarker} user interface: Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan . project manager: kinda going round , yeah . industrial designer: Mm . project manager: Um I mean e even if {disfmarker} user interface: Because {disfmarker} project manager: I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . user interface: Yeah . project manager: So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . Uh-huh . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: W sort of {disfmarker} industrial designer: Great . {vocalsound} Um as for the energy source um , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , but we don't have to be limited by that . We can use a hand-dynamo . Um I don't know what that means , we crank it ? {vocalsound} project manager: Uh It's I think it's basically the more you move i it , it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda {vocalsound} powers it . industrial designer: Right , it's like those watches that you c project manager: Uh yeah . industrial designer: So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power . user interface: Oh , a d a dynamo ? marketing: Yeah , {gap} . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , I like that , yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {gap} user interface: Yeah , like with those watches that you kind of twist . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah that's quite cool . industrial designer: Okay . So if it if it's not working , I guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing . {vocalsound} marketing: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . You shake it and scream at it . marketing: But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , it is , yeah . marketing: Because then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat project manager: It does leave them with an obligation to {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , to mo Yeah . project manager: Especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated . marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: Right . marketing: because most of the people {disfmarker} project manager: Then if it's just sitting on the {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , okay . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: That's true . project manager: Right um what are the other options ? industrial designer: Uh there's solar power . Um . marketing: Uh , solar power will w also not be a good idea , because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: and the days when there is no sola sunlight {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: I'm I'm with uh Raj on that , industrial designer: Okay , so probably just {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: I think , you know , marketing: What we w project manager: I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window . user interface: {gap} marketing: yeah . I think we should {disfmarker} a rechargeable {vocalsound} battery will be a good idea . user interface: But w {vocalsound} like just normal light ? project manager: Oh that's true . marketing: They can they can recharge it . project manager: I mean I w I w uh user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: that idea that I thought {vocalsound} um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother industrial designer: Mm . project manager: is having a , user interface: And we're a very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as well ? project manager: yeah , marketing: Yeah . project manager: having a rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as {disfmarker} uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: 'Kay . user interface: Like like a hand {disfmarker} like one of those portable phones kind of thing . marketing: Yeah , that's {disfmarker} Yeah , exactly . project manager: Yeah that kind of thing . industrial designer: Okay . So uh a rechargeable battery {gap} . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . Um the user interface , the buttons , I guess we talked about this already . project manager: Rechargeable . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Um . project manager: {gap} . What's chip on print ? What's {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm ? project manager: Sorry , never mind . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh th the uh the electronics um , basically the more features we add um {disfmarker} Oops , this one . So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in , user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: which adds to the cost as you can expect . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Um . But uh I think we can keep it all under budget . So uh yes , so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: So just in time . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping . user interface: Just in time . industrial designer: Right , right . project manager: That's good . industrial designer: Yeah , project manager: Uh woah . industrial designer: and keeping the L_C_D_ screen out . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , we're we're kind of uh we're kind of um {vocalsound} Excuse m I've just deleted that whole thing . Um we're kind of running out of time , so if you could {disfmarker} Uh . {vocalsound} Was that you ? industrial designer: Huh ? project manager: Um that was {disfmarker} your bit's covered , industrial designer: Oh yeah that was that was it . project manager: I just dele I just accidentally deleted what I was supposed to say next . industrial designer: {gap} marketing: Uh excuse me , Bri project manager: Um , yeah . industrial designer: So control F_ eight , right ? project manager: Oh , yeah . user interface: Yeah , mine seems to have turned off . project manager: And I just touch the pad . user interface: I can't do anything . marketing: You just touch the pad , yeah . user interface: No . marketing: No ? project manager: {vocalsound} It's actually shut down . user interface: It's on , but there's nothing on the screen . project manager: Okay , um now what we have {disfmarker} industrial designer: Try uh flipping the screen down {gap} . project manager: uh our next meeting's in half an hour industrial designer: 'Kay . project manager: and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay . industrial designer: Oh , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I get to do it , too . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . It's you guys . Yeah . industrial designer: Oh neat . user interface: Cool . {vocalsound} project manager: So um , you know I mean , luckily we chose a nice simple shape . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . user interface: Yeah . Mm . project manager: {vocalsound} Um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Okay . Save everything to the shared documents , is that right ? marketing: {gap} That's great . project manager: Uh yeah , I hope I can recover this , 'cause I've accidentally deleted it . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: {vocalsound} Which doesn't really help me much . user interface: I think , I've saved mine already . project manager: Yeah , can you save that {disfmarker} uh send that last one again , please , Raj , marketing: Yeah . project manager: as I still can't find it on the {disfmarker} marketing: Uh it was under a different name . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: I will show you , in shared documents . project manager: Okay . marketing: Uh working components {gap} . Oh , you didn't get that . I will send new . project manager: No . Okay , thank you . marketing: Uh I'll put it in shared documents , again . project manager: Um yeah , Project , Project Documents . marketing: Project documents , sorry , I put it in the shared documents . project manager: Uh right , marketing: Uh yeah . project manager: that's that's the that {disfmarker} it goes there automatically if you put it in Project Documents . Project Documents is on the um {vocalsound} desktop . marketing: Right , that's great . But I cou can't open that , because it w asks uh for some username or password . industrial designer: Oh {gap} . project manager: Really ? {gap} marketing: {gap} I'll show you . industrial designer: Uh these lapel mics are trouble . marketing: Ts project manager: Oh right , I think um {disfmarker} marketing: Sorry . project manager: Hold on . marketing: Uh . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , I don't know if y it it just ca it just came up on my um on my agenda . S {vocalsound} Um presumably there's clay somewhere . Um . {vocalsound} Four . marketing: Yeah , that's great . project manager: Whoops . Light , light , please . Light . {vocalsound} Right , there you go . marketing: Yeah , th thank you . project manager: Yeah , quite . And we're using this our basic chip set , so it's all good . {vocalsound} marketing: Oh sorry . industrial designer: Are we done with our meeting ? marketing: Uh excuse me , Brian . project manager: Um I think we're almost done , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: You have to keep your pen separate , because I used your pen . project manager: Oh oops . marketing: S {vocalsound} project manager: Sorry man . Uh okay , still didn't manage to get down all the last bits so we had rechargeable and {disfmarker} Uh . Apples . {vocalsound} Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm . 'Kay , so we came up with that , that's okay . What's supplements ? Supplements . Uh {vocalsound} uh . {vocalsound} See . {vocalsound} user interface: Cool . Fun . project manager: I shoulda {gap} something like that . If I kn see I I knew that . I shoulda sort of engineered it so we k ended up making a diffi difficult shape . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Hmm . project manager: {vocalsound} Just for cruelty . {vocalsound} marketing: Hmm . user interface: Yeah . Star fruit . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} I wonder if they mean like literally make it , sort of buttons and everything . marketing: So sh should Should we leave now , Brian ? user interface: No . Oh yeah , we can do buttons . marketing: Or we are going to discuss something ? project manager: Um . Uh no , I think that's us our discussion over unless anybody's got questions {vocalsound} or confusions , marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: No I'm good . project manager: 'cause I'm confused . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Huh ? user interface: Okay . marketing: Excuse me . {vocalsound} project manager: Um uh we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute , it's a {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Sorry . Thank you . Yeah . project manager: There we go . Warning , finish meeting now . marketing: So . project manager: I rounded it up far too fast . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} . Where are we going ? My Documents , that's not what I want . My Project Documents . {vocalsound} There we go .
