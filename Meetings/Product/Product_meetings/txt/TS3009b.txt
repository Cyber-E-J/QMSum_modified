marketing: Great man . Who starts ? project manager: Well I'll uh start just with another presentation , so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting . marketing: Alright , great . Alright . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . I've put some uh new things in the in the map . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Uh oh . {vocalsound} This is it . I don't know the shortcut , so {disfmarker} Ah F_ five . Well our functional design meeting , that's the stage we're in . industrial designer: Mm . project manager: And you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it . marketing: Yes . project manager: Well um in we'll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we uh thought we had dec decided . But uh {disfmarker} Uh then we'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you . I think you have prepared uh all three uh ? {vocalsound} marketing: 'Kay . industrial designer: Well , yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Um we'll look at th the new project requirements we uh {disfmarker} I dunno . Y you also have uh received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ? industrial designer: No . {vocalsound} project manager: Oh I've received a mail with uh some additional requirements , marketing: No . You're the only one . {vocalsound} project manager: and I'll have a look if {disfmarker} industrial designer: Oh . marketing: Alright . project manager: Well I think we should show them before your presentations , because it's not really uh smart uh to uh to include some things uh we can't , because of the new requirements . Well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions . marketing: 'Kay . project manager: We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be . And then uh we can discuss uh some more closely . Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: We have forty minutes for this uh discussion ? project manager: Uh yeah , I think so . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Alright . project manager: Well uh {gap} the closing uh we'll not uh look at it yet . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Alright . project manager: Um {vocalsound} now I'll look at {gap} show {gap} this board . Um {disfmarker} Well uh notes , first meeting . Now . I gave a disc a a presentation . Uh we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas . So we said that uh we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors , and uh look at their uh remote controls . marketing: Right . project manager: We should make it uh compatible with our new D_V_D_ and other releases we have , our technical releases . industrial designer: Huh ? project manager: Uh not too many one buttons . One recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with . And um well they can have two functions , because uh you have a D_V_D_ and a television . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Um the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar . {vocalsound} It's uh one of our ideas . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah well that wa It's just thirty minutes ago , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: so it's not quite uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But well I have to do it . industrial designer: Mm-hmm , now it's right . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: The materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from {gap} , and uh well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible . It should be uh recognisable at all times . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: It's meant to be easily wiped out , yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Yes . user interface: Mm . marketing: Okay . project manager: Well fronts were to be {gap} just like mobile telephones . And uh the technical aspects um {disfmarker} And also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards . Well that's just uh some ideas from the first meeting . It's quite logical al all of it . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them . I got this mail from uh our bosses . Well , teletext goes out . We will not use teletext . user interface: Oh . marketing: Okay . project manager: Maybe a new sort of thing , but n but not teletext . industrial designer: I I disagree , but uh it's not uh t it's not my place to disagree I guess . project manager: Well {disfmarker} the second is a bit sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_ user interface: Oh . project manager: and they don't want it , because of our time we have for this project . marketing: Alright . industrial designer: Oh , alright . user interface: Oh , that's a shame . project manager: So that's a shame , because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years . Because uh we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point . Um well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it . marketing: Yeah . But let's forget about it . It's just time-consuming , project manager: Yeah . marketing: so we uh have to go on . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and um {disfmarker} Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh , well as we already said a actually , uh familiar . Uh not only just uh the shape but also our company . marketing: Yes . industrial designer: Yeah , we are a {vocalsound} real fashionable company . I read uh I read it on the {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: I didn't know what company we were , marketing: Mm . industrial designer: but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay . industrial designer: So it has to be uh a modern design . That's important to know , uh when you design a thing of course . project manager: Yes . I I uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have , our company . It's uh we mm put the fashion in electronics . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So maybe that's a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something . marketing: Right . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Alright then um we're going to uh have three presentations . marketing: Yeah . project manager: You want to start ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} I think I have to start . project manager: {vocalsound} Oh you have to start ? I didn't see anything about uh who had to start . industrial designer: {vocalsound} The order ? No . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Oh no , no problem . project manager: Well s then start . user interface: Mm . marketing: I I just have to uh to think which file's mine , user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: 'cause I was uh bit in a hurry . project manager: Okay . Well uh {disfmarker} marketing: I think it's this one . But I'm not sure . {gap} project manager: {gap} You already uh opened uh PowerPoint . marketing: Hmm ? Yeah . S Right . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yes . This is it . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Well , I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Um to start with these points . Uh next sheet ? Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls , because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things . Uh , furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use . {vocalsound} Um then I tell something about um the most important issues . So we have to focus on those three thing three things . And in the end I'll um show you our target {vocalsound} audience or our target product users , customers . Well , {vocalsound} um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: That's seventy five per cent of the current users . They don't like it , so we might think about fronts in that section . Um {disfmarker} They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control . {vocalsound} Um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions . Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy . Furthermore , it's uh {vocalsound} seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb . industrial designer: {vocalsound} You can zap away . Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , yeah right . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Right . A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their {vocalsound} in their living room . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that's your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily . project manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . marketing: I dunno , maybe that's an idea . industrial designer: Oh . marketing: 'Cause it's uh a big {disfmarker} I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Oh ? project manager: It should actually uh {disfmarker} It should actually be loose from the television , user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: because it can also be used for other televisions . So if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it . marketing: Yeah but what if you lose your click-on device ? project manager: No you can click it on your television . marketing: Yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ? project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah in another room , yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Well yes . marketing: Nee but it it specifically says it's uh the the control is lost in the same room . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: So {disfmarker} Well a beeping device would be {disfmarker} project manager: Well we'll have a look at it , yeah . marketing: Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem . Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn . So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course . Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah but people don't read manuals . industrial designer: I didn't read it ? user interface: No . industrial designer: Oh , alright . marketing: No . industrial designer: {gap} users to uh add one ? Do you think ? user interface: I don't think {disfmarker} marketing: I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use , than a manual . user interface: Yeah . Yes you should {disfmarker} You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yep . industrial designer: Yeah alright . Because they don't use it ? Alright . project manager: Well there sh should always be a menu , marketing: Yeah . Right . project manager: but it c can be very short . marketing: And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes . user interface: Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think . project manager: Yes okay . industrial designer: Well maybe for the {disfmarker} If you don't recognise a button who d who d who do I call uh wh when I don't know it ? marketing: Alright . user interface: Yeah right . It sh it should be there , the manual . But but not to explain how the remote works . Only {disfmarker} {gap} marketing: And we don't have much time . So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design . So you can pick up and use it , than {disfmarker} I think . project manager: Well we are a design team , user interface: Hmm . project manager: we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Isn't it part of the of the u marketing: Yeah right , right . project manager: So user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: No . No . Never mind . project manager: Well we'll have a look . Um yes ? marketing: Next point . Um R_S_I_ . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Well that's about twenty per cent I thought . But uh the designer should uh take it uh {vocalsound} should uh {disfmarker} Wie zeg ik dat ? Yeah , consider the consequences of using your remote . industrial designer: Consider the m Yeah . marketing: It should be a good in your hand . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yep . marketing: Right , this is the most important part . Um , we're {disfmarker} Like the requirements said , we're gonna specify of we're gonna target a younger audience . Um , {vocalsound} that's about sixty per cent of the market , so it's uh quite important . Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . Uh {disfmarker} I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that . project manager: Well {disfmarker} marketing: So it's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs . project manager: Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost , we can't uh afford an L_C_D_ uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: It's going to be expensive . Yeah . user interface: No . marketing: Yeah but {vocalsound} they think it's really important . project manager: Yeah . marketing: So if we want to s If we have a big {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If we make lots of uh of the stuff , maybe we can uh buy it very cheap , I dunno . We have to uh {disfmarker} project manager: Well {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well we'll uh consider it uh . project manager: Yeah well uh it's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: We'll think abo we'll think {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , I don't know . I don't have any information on that . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Nigh user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: I know . {vocalsound} industrial designer: No , we'll look we'll look into that later . Alright ? marketing: Right . And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . They also like that , user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: but research is very uh costly . So {disfmarker} user interface: I think that's uh difficult to realise also . marketing: Yeah , but {vocalsound} it {vocalsound} it might be important for the sale . industrial designer: We have very demanding clients . project manager: It's not yet a standard uh development uh those so {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} No and we have customers in multiple uh countries I think . project manager: We sh marketing: Well I do think L_C_D_ is more reachable than the speech recognition . project manager: Yeah absolutely . user interface: Yeah . marketing: So we might consider L_C_D_ screens . user interface: {vocalsound} No . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah , alright . Well we'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find , I think . project manager: Yep . industrial designer: We don't rule them out uh yet . marketing: Alright . project manager: {gap} 'Kay . marketing: Alright . Um , I think that's it . Um {disfmarker} project manager: Alright . marketing: I think it is sensible to u uh to take this take these points into the notes . project manager: Yes . marketing: So you can {disfmarker} Right . project manager: Well you {disfmarker} I c I can uh still see your presentation . marketing: Yeah . Right . project manager: It's in the {disfmarker} Well uh next um I dunno who is next . user interface: Oh you go . industrial designer: Shall I give a technical talk ? project manager: Yes . industrial designer: Alright . project manager: Well go ahead . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design . project manager: Yip . industrial designer: {vocalsound} We have that here . Okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the {disfmarker} project manager: F_ five . industrial designer: F_ F_ five . project manager: {vocalsound} F_ five . industrial designer: Yep . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well , the working design , marketing: Alright . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: that's my uh {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Next button . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well alright uh , you know who I am and what I do . So uh we have this . It's a bit uh unclear because I wanted to copy paste something . It was originally in black and white marketing: Oh right . industrial designer: but it became black and purple . marketing: Purple {vocalsound} . industrial designer: But I think you can read it . user interface: {vocalsound} {gap} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah . A bit . industrial designer: Um well um I think it's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control . Uh well you can see uh {disfmarker} marketing: Maybe you can select it . So it uh inverts . industrial designer: {gap} And I then can select I can select on the dings {gap} It goes to the next page . marketing: {gap} the p the whole picture . project manager: Click . {vocalsound} marketing: Nah , uh never mind . industrial designer: Well , you can read it , user interface: Yeah , go ahead . industrial designer: it's not too difficult . Meanwhile , this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works . You have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control , uh and the sender , w which is the LED , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set . marketing: Yeah . Alright . industrial designer: And uh the source is of course the user . Uh the user interface is um {vocalsound} uh the {vocalsound} the {gap} the buttons of course . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: And the {vocalsound} the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip uh sends it to the LED , and the LED sends it to the receiver . That's the that's the basic idea . project manager: Yep . industrial designer: Very basic . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Um well I have uh {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} put it in a in in in a {vocalsound} a couple of basic steps . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key . It does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed . The key {gap} a signal to a chip , uh the chip senses the connection . {vocalsound} uh and recognise the key . So {vocalsound} well you understand . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED , which is the bulb , of course . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set , project manager: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: and the T_V_ set uh also recognises the the {vocalsound} the signal , and performs the assigned task . project manager: So it is also why we have to have a button that says uh I'm now busy with a D_V_D_ uh if we had done that . And a button for T_V_ . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Ah bu Yeah , but we don't . Uh we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: No no , but {disfmarker} Yeah . Exactly . Uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I've some couple of pictures here . It's a very basic one . And uh {gap} if we if we're going to add an uh an uh L_C_D_ screen to it , it uh won't look anything like this , but {disfmarker} This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control . It has uh very little buttons and {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: But it it uh it's it's quite um {disfmarker} Yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons . They're uh far enough apart and an anything . It's not very um uh not very high-tech uh user interface: High tech . {vocalsound} industrial designer: indeed , and it's not very user-friendly . Uh if you look at the shape , it's uh just a simple long box uh shape . So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , and that uh problems like uh R_S_I_ and uh those kinds of thing don't don't oc don't occur . marketing: Right . Can I say something ? industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons . Uh the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext . Well teletext is not an option , so that uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences . industrial designer: Yeah , because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately {disfmarker} marketing: Right . Make them big , make them easy to uh to press . project manager: Well but but {vocalsound} user interface: You can also like {disfmarker} industrial designer: You don't have to look and and search for them . project manager: if you have um the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same um well moves . marketing: Right . user interface: Yeah , I was thinking you can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , right . Right . project manager: But if y if you would put it at a different place , then you have to move your hands , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: and that's on of the things about R_S_I_ . user interface: Are some of the the the um {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , that's right . That's right . That's right . industrial designer: Well you you can't have any uh every button {vocalsound} under the thumb , of course . marketing: We project manager: No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ . marketing: But {disfmarker} Yeah . That's very important . And {disfmarker} user interface: Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this . Like some uh little uh Gameboy things or some project manager: Yes I've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons . marketing: But is that is that useable ? user interface: Hmm ? marketing: Do people , uh when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ? project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Well {disfmarker} marketing: It's a f it's a new feature , project manager: Well it it's {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it . user interface: Yeah alright , but {disfmarker} project manager: Well also i if someone puts {vocalsound} picks up his uh remote {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , but if you s say them up and down , they they'll understand it {gap} , I think . project manager: Yeah . If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel . user interface: Eighty per cent would . industrial designer: Well , {gap} . marketing: Yeah , he feels it immediately . project manager: That's very irritating , I think . user interface: Yeah that's true . marketing: Yeah , that's right . Yeah . user interface: Yeah but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Right , continue . industrial designer: But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb . marketing: Sorry . {vocalsound} industrial designer: I think that's a good idea , and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , because uh they don't use it uh all the time . Well it's uh pretty pretty {vocalsound} basically uh as you said . project manager: Yep . industrial designer: And I have some pictures of the inside workings , but uh I don't want to get too technical , project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you . project manager: {vocalsound} That's your part of the job . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , that's right . industrial designer: So yeah {gap} exactly {gap} this is uh how it uh looks from the inside . project manager: Yep . industrial designer: And uh well that's about it I think . Oh yeah , I still have this . Oh I had to delete this , but I had to make a schematic uh of the of the new {disfmarker} marketing: Alright . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: But I had too too little time , marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: but uh don't uh don't look at it please . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Well we understand . industrial designer: I I think it's it's clear uh how it works . marketing: Alright . project manager: We understand . marketing: Yeah , it's clear . project manager: Oh right , no . industrial designer: Alright . That's the most important thing . project manager: Nice . Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation . industrial designer: Alright . Uh {disfmarker} project manager: How late is did we start his presentation uh ? {gap} industrial designer: Right . marketing: {vocalsound} I dunno . I think uh w About twenty minutes ago ? project manager: Wha Yeah . marketing: Losing time losing time . {vocalsound} project manager: Well then we have still the time , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But we do have to come to a decision , right later on . marketing: Yeah right . So {disfmarker} project manager: So {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . project manager: {vocalsound} {gap} user interface: Well I thought um everybody on the website {vocalsound} uh would see the same thing , but obviously {vocalsound} that's not the case . marketing: I don't think so . industrial designer: Yeah , uh there are different uh {disfmarker} We have all have different home pages , with different links . project manager: Oh yeah ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah right . project manager: Uh ? user interface: For instance you couldn't see this . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Okay , yeah well . user interface: Um {disfmarker} Yeah . Well I'm Mike {gap} , User Interface Designer . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: The the method ? Well {disfmarker} I used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Um {disfmarker} marketing: These are already in use ? user interface: Yes , these are from from another uh manufacturer . marketing: Alright , okay . user interface: Um {disfmarker} This one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and um things . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: Um {disfmarker} marketing: Well {disfmarker} project manager: I like user-centred . marketing: Yeah , me too . user interface: I like user-centr centred uh {vocalsound} uh also the best . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . We also do that . user interface: Um {disfmarker} Well , I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also , and teletext and that kind of stuff . marketing: Mm . user interface: Uh so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one . marketing: But we have to reject that , because of the requirements ? user interface: But {disfmarker} Yes . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Th that's why this mm is not relevant any more I feel . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Alright . user interface: Um {disfmarker} I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need . marketing: Yeah , right . user interface: {vocalsound} I um I kinda like the shape . {vocalsound} I think this is what we talked about . But {disfmarker} industrial designer: {gap} You can't really see uh the differ from different sides . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: But I think uh {disfmarker} user interface: No I've {disfmarker} Well I showed it somewhere . Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh you can draw it if you {disfmarker} Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} Oh yeah . I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: So we can can uh yeah customise the {disfmarker} project manager: Well absolutely , but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company . So we cannot just uh make someone w user interface: Mm ? {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} It's a front . It's not the the whole remote that changes , of course . project manager: No but that's th the side they look uh look at is the front . user interface: You can {disfmarker} marketing: But it {disfmarker} project manager: So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then uh our recognition is totally gone . user interface: Mm . marketing: Yeah , that's right user interface: Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote . marketing: Yeah , that's a must . user interface: So l like Ericsson does {gap} every uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , we must . industrial designer: We can put it on the on the back side . marketing: We must have that . project manager: Yeah well and and {disfmarker} user interface: S something like this . {vocalsound} project manager: Yes . user interface: It's recognisable . project manager: 'Kay . user interface: Um {disfmarker} marketing: We can make a symbol of the company right here . And {vocalsound} if you put a front on it , there's a hole on the front . So the symbol's always on user interface: Yeah ? industrial designer: Yeah , so that you don't replace the symbol , yeah . project manager: Yeah yeah yeah . user interface: Yeah yeah . Something like that , project manager: Or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front . user interface: in the {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Those kind of things . user interface: Yeah . marketing: But let's not focus on the front {gap} . {vocalsound} project manager: Yes . Okay . user interface: Um {disfmarker} Well so uh uh like I said I thought we'd we'd use more function . If we we had to include more functions . But we don't . So um {disfmarker} project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need . marketing: Alright . user interface: Maybe some less . Like eject we don't need , and some other buttons we don't need . I think uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mike , uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ? In Map ? user interface: Yeah , I will . I think uh for the remote um uh less is more . {vocalsound} The less buttons the better the design . Um {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . user interface: We should go with that concept I think . marketing: Yeah , I agree . user interface: I know . project manager: Alright . marketing: I've I've got another point . project manager: Yeah ? marketing: Um there are two target audi audiences , and we've uh chose for the younger one . user interface: Mm . marketing: Um , research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features . They are high high interested in feature . But they are more critical . Fo Yeah , critical . industrial designer: The younger uh {disfmarker} marketing: So {disfmarker} The younger audience . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people . project manager: Well what if we um {disfmarker} I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip , marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: a f a little uh {disfmarker} You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . I think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} marketing: Clip aren't used much . project manager: Well but because you say they their features are important , they want m um a lot , industrial designer: No um mm usually {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah right . industrial designer: But {disfmarker} project manager: but not {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , but what kind of features ? Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition . industrial designer: Yeah I think {vocalsound} m most {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah but {disfmarker} Yeah . user interface: But I've {disfmarker} industrial designer: Most uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Here , look at these numbers . The newest features are , like I said , are uh L_C_D_ and uh speech uh control . Our audience , these people , are very like these uh features . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . Uh . marketing: You see ? So we must build in something , or they will to uh go to the concurrent . project manager: {vocalsound} Competitors . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . Our competitor . Yeah . marketing: The concurrent ? {vocalsound} Competitors , right . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} So , I do think we have to uh have some features . project manager: Yeah . Well maybe w we could uh s marketing: Even though they cost a little more . project manager: On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something , marketing: Right . Right . project manager: or that you can click uh out uh of the remote . And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information . marketing: Like a ticker-tape . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Which programme you are l watching or something . user interface: Yeah , that's nice . {vocalsound} project manager: Those kind of things , uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your V_ V_C_R_s . And uh well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you're currently watching . marketing: Yeah , right . Yeah right . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your L_C_D_ screen . {vocalsound} project manager: For example . It it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it . user interface: Yeah , we should keep that simple too . project manager: Yeah . user interface: It will {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: But should it uh really be uh clickable , uh {vocalsound} project manager: Well maybe . marketing: No not clickable . user interface: No , it should be uh integrated . industrial designer: or {vocalsound} or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy . {vocalsound} marketing: Nah , no no no . user interface: I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , just at at the top . So when you s {vocalsound} you sit like this you can can watch . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: Yeah , marketing: I think it should be at the top . user interface: something like on um some radios in car . You {disfmarker} Where it's , yeah , walking to {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah right . It's a ticker-tape idea . project manager: R_D_S_s or something . industrial designer: But that's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design , with the scrolling text and {vocalsound} that kind of thing . user interface: Wa Yeah . project manager: Well I think it's you got {disfmarker} It just means it's a script that's uh keeps it uh rolling , marketing: Well it's just one script . {vocalsound} project manager: and it's not uh {disfmarker} That's five minutes off uh implementing time I think uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming . project manager: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: So I don't think that's the issue . project manager: No . industrial designer: Alright . marketing: Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ? project manager: Uh well I think so , yes . Um {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost . marketing: 'Kay . Right , I don't know if I can find that , but {disfmarker} project manager: We're g No but we're we'll have to look into that . user interface: Or maybe you will get that information uh {disfmarker} project manager: Um we can use this board again , I think . marketing: Next time . Yeah right . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want , th the issue . {vocalsound} Where is my presentation ? {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , I understand what you're saying . project manager: {gap} Uh {disfmarker} marketing: We should have a general idea of how it's gonna look . project manager: Well {disfmarker} I mean we're all here now , I think . These I've already given you . So we have to decide on the different remote control functions . So we want to have a small L_C_D_ screen that's special . marketing: Right . At the top . industrial designer: Shouldn't we start with the most important parts ? project manager: Yes . user interface: At the top or at the bottom ? industrial designer: The L_C_D_ screen alright {gap} but we should start with the power button ? marketing: I think the top is more uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah but {disfmarker} marketing: When you s How do you zap ? project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: You just sit in your chair ? project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Huh ? user interface: Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . marketing: With the remote ? project manager: That thing is terrible . user interface: 'Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah but that's where your hand ball might be . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , no Mm . marketing: Yeah , I dunno . industrial designer: And then uh {disfmarker} marketing: We'll draw two , and then we'll see uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here . {vocalsound} I dunno what uh you were talking about but {disfmarker} marketing: No {vocalsound} industrial designer: {gap} we are busy with something {gap} . marketing: Um he thinks {disfmarker} Yeah , right . He thinks it's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom , and I think it's better at the top . project manager: Well {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh-huh . Why do you think it's better at the bottom ? user interface: Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody . marketing: But your {disfmarker} user interface: I c industrial designer: But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , so that there's room for the for the interface . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Well I d I think that's that's ugly but {disfmarker} marketing: The the ticker {disfmarker} The L_C_D_ is like like small . {vocalsound} It's it's wide . industrial designer: Uh-huh . marketing: It's not not high . But {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point , user interface: {vocalsound} I th industrial designer: And and we can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . user interface: Yeah . Power button always {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: Bottom . project manager: So and and I I like to use the ones on the top . user interface: Yeah , y you gotta zap like this or {vocalsound} you want to {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: So when I u when I have to have an L_C_D_ s scr window {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah right . But {disfmarker} We're making a remote with {vocalsound} with a few functions you know . industrial designer: Well {vocalsound} that's {vocalsound} a bit exaggerated . Well , I agree with you {gap} . It's it's also more recognisable . marketing: We industrial designer: It looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the the thing on top . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yes but we we we we don't want that . user interface: Yeah you don't want {disfmarker} project manager: We don't want them to look like a calculator . user interface: You want uh {disfmarker} Yeah it it it must be a remote . project manager: We want to look it like our original but familiar {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah w well , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: but uh you don't have to throw uh um important aspe {vocalsound} important aspect like familiarity uh completely away , marketing: High-tech {gap} . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yea industrial designer: uh because {vocalsound} I think it's uh {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Maybe a bic uh better uh white uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We White ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: I think it's still important to have it at the top , marketing: Width . project manager: Width . Uh format yeah format ? Line width ? Width ? industrial designer: because it's uh it's more familiar that way . marketing: {gap} Th that's not a problem . project manager: Yeah ? marketing: {vocalsound} When I draw here it user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {disfmarker} Oh . Huh ? project manager: It's a bit off . marketing: Yeah , it's off . project manager: Well . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} A little a little bit . marketing: {vocalsound} It {vocalsound} it needs to be calibrated again . Well {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: Well uh let's uh talk about that later uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Maybe you should another pen . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Maybe that's uh better . {gap} You e you only have one pen for that screen . Yeah . marketing: Where ? project manager: It's special pen . marketing: {vocalsound} Alright , we have to make a decision now , project manager: Yeah . marketing: because we don't have much time . Um {disfmarker} project manager: No . marketing: I think we have uh a few functions , and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand . industrial designer: Yeah . I I agree . project manager: I think it should be at the button , bottom . Bottom . The L_C_D_ . user interface: At the bottom ? industrial designer: Well I'm the {vocalsound} I I'm the designer , so um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} In a few minutes {disfmarker} marketing: At the bot user interface: Oh yeah , oh yeah , I totally agree . Yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: So {disfmarker} We are two uh V_S_ two . {vocalsound} project manager: Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions , user interface: {vocalsound} He's the boss . {vocalsound} project manager: and then look at the design . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Right . Great . industrial designer: Uh we uh we were busy with that . project manager: Because we have to decide this . industrial designer: Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: So , we have the power button . marketing: And moreover I think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the L_C_D_ s . project manager: Yes . marketing: It's uh your it's your job . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Well we have a power button . industrial designer: Yeah of course . Uh it's uh . Yeah . W wh user interface: No it's our job . project manager: Guys ? user interface: For all of us I think . {vocalsound} industrial designer: While you have to agree , I can say {gap} it's like this and {vocalsound} you must agree . Yeah . marketing: Yeah , right . project manager: Guys ? marketing: Alright , let's keep it central . project manager: {vocalsound} We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} The ten numbers ? Yeah ? industrial designer: Channel , yeah . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} user interface: Volume ? industrial designer: Volume control . project manager: Yes . industrial designer: Um {disfmarker} project manager: Uh the mute button . industrial designer: Well let's look at your uh design . Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Mm . project manager: I h love that one . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh-huh . user interface: I think we we should use something like this um to um {disfmarker} The the channel up and channel down button ? {vocalsound} Yeah , in circle , you know ? project manager: Yes . Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . Well that's that's also design . user interface: And and a volume control also in it . project manager: Yes . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Right . industrial designer: {gap} Yeah . project manager: Well h ho industrial designer: But th th on this remote th these controls are for something else , a D_V_D_ player or something . So {disfmarker} project manager: Yes . Yes . They are for some uh video uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yes , as I already said , we could drop some of these buttons . {vocalsound} marketing: You should put that uh power button , channel and volume should have the most uh importance . user interface: Yeah . I think these should be in one big circle in the middle . marketing: Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_ was {vocalsound} t kinda true . When {gap} {vocalsound} when you uh put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you're doing the same thing all the time , project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: and that's just what R_S_I_'s all about . So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other . project manager: Apart . So people have to move their hand . And they get less uh complaints of R_S_I_ . industrial designer: Yeah , it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand . project manager: {gap} That's what I always do , industrial designer: Y {gap} project manager: because all my i important buttons are the same place . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . It's good to move uh from time to time . Yeah . project manager: Yes ? user interface: Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place . marketing: Um {disfmarker} project manager: Well not {disfmarker} user interface: They they need to be centred . industrial designer: No but now y W would we have to choose a way in middle ? marketing: Frequency of uh button use . project manager: Yes . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour . You can see . project manager: Uh-huh . user interface: {vocalsound} Volume hardly . marketing: So the the {vocalsound} channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . user interface: No I don't think . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Oh . project manager: Up and down far apart from each other ? industrial designer: Far apart ? marketing: {gap} {vocalsound} You thinking uh about R_S_I_ ? user interface: Yeah but {disfmarker} project manager: Well not too much . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah but {disfmarker} marketing: Y look at uh look at the frequency . user interface: No . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: Nei not too much , but {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} The other the other two uh frustrations are far more important . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together . project manager: Well for example the power button , you can {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: Well they are used four times an hour , so {disfmarker} project manager: If someone is constantly z zapping , it's not going to miss , that it that the power button is not right beside it . Because I have someone {disfmarker} But the buttons is way . marketing: Nei nei nei n I I totally agree . project manager: So that one can be put away . marketing: But just {disfmarker} Yeah . Right . Yeah . I agree . project manager: The power button can uh be uh uh {disfmarker} user interface: Power bu button should be left at the top . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yes . marketing: And should and should be red . project manager: Oh man , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: five minutes . {vocalsound} Yeah , well five minutes left . marketing: Right , just make some decisions . project manager: Yep . marketing: The most important things we have to uh {disfmarker} project manager: Um how are we going to do it with those numbers ? industrial designer: C c can you make you make {disfmarker} We can use uh the drawing board now , I think . Uh it it doesn't work well but {disfmarker} But it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing . project manager: Well I have it here . Yeah well that's going to take too too much time . marketing: I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now . project manager: Yes . user interface: Mm . Yeah . marketing: Just uh you decide that , you decide that , industrial designer: Mm . Alright . project manager: Yes . marketing: and {vocalsound} ready . project manager: Well the L_C_D_ . Um you are Industrial , you are User Interface . So I think it's going to go to Mike . But you will have to make consensus with {gap} . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Well {disfmarker} user interface: Well consensus , um {disfmarker} We we can put it in the middle , so {disfmarker} project manager: Well it's a bit hard , because we are going to be uh individually . marketing: Nei . We're {disfmarker} No {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: That's a bit uh {disfmarker} marketing: We're deciding now , so {disfmarker} project manager: Yes . marketing: Top or bottom ? industrial designer: Well uh yeah I I still think it's it's quite important though to uh to have it at the top , so project manager: Yes it is . industrial designer: {disfmarker} Yeah . You say familiarity isn't important but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ? Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh ? marketing: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah d Yeah . marketing: Yeah , right . Okay . project manager: Alright these functions . user interface: Alright . industrial designer: As we we we we agreed , we do have a L_C_D_ . project manager: The number f Well yes , that's alright . industrial designer: So that's that's enough . Yeah . marketing: Yeah , okay . project manager: W the number function . Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ? user interface: No . project manager: How do you want it to do then ? user interface: Well just when you push a one one and {disfmarker} industrial designer: There's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero . project manager: It it has to r recognise one as {vocalsound} there could still come more . user interface: No , {vocalsound} if you {disfmarker} On most T_V_s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other , {vocalsound} d it {disfmarker} industrial designer: Oh , like that . Um {disfmarker} project manager: Yes . industrial designer: They'd recognise it . project manager: Alright so no button for that . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Th that's the most {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: That that's very easy . Yeah . marketing: No . project manager: Okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote ? industrial designer: I think these are the the most important functions . marketing: Do you still have the pictures over there ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: So {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , that's about it . You do need the uh multi Or did uh {disfmarker} No , like this one . You do need them ? project manager: No , we'd uh just said we didn't uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , I know . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: But are we {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Well uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Alright , alright uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Now okay . project manager: {vocalsound} Um well because we can't integrate it with any other uh remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant . So just for a television is that all we need ? marketing: Right . Yeah , it's most useable this way . industrial designer: {gap} basic function . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Teletext is gone . So all those buttons that {vocalsound} ar are to do with teletext {disfmarker} Oh screen placing . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: We'll have uh those uh buttons about uh {disfmarker} And uh the two important ones we're l f forgetting . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh there's um {vocalsound} screen . You can make it wider and less wide . marketing: Yeah . project manager: And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video . marketing: Right . industrial designer: Oh yeah . marketing: I do think we have to put that underneath a clip . project manager: Those two ? But it's just two , and we make a clip ? industrial designer: Uh just two just two under uh under uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Th that's a bit uh waste . user interface: We we can make {vocalsound} make uh a little row of like four buttons down here . project manager: Yes . marketing: Yeah . Okay , right . project manager: Or at the top . {vocalsound} industrial designer: I I think uh {disfmarker} project manager: Your L_C_D_ screen is going to go . {vocalsound} user interface: Or at {disfmarker} industrial designer: But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section . user interface: Yeah alright then . industrial designer: Uh that's that's too complicated . project manager: Yes . industrial designer: You can just put it somewhere project manager: Yeah industrial designer: {disfmarker} They they aren't used much , not as much as those other , so you can put it somewhere {disfmarker} user interface: Oh , they can be small or round like buttons . industrial designer: Yeah s bit smaller and s Well uh and and I think more at the bottom . Yeah . Yeah or at the top , yeah . What do you think uh those those buttons ? project manager: Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote . industrial designer: Above or down ? And w where ? Well we design it later . We have it , and we design later where everything goes . Yeah . project manager: Yes ? Yes . Yes . Well any other uh {disfmarker} marketing: Well if you {vocalsound} you take those th If you {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: Why go to video ? project manager: Go to video , that's always on your remote control . To A_V_ uh to A_V_ A_V_ A_V_ . marketing: Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: The the video channel uh ? user interface: That's just zero . Yeah . project manager: Well l n no not at not at my remote . industrial designer: No no not always . Ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , but you can can zap down {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , but when you zap down zero you get to A_V_ . project manager: Yes . I don't . user interface: Yes , I think th project manager: I go to ninety-nine . {vocalsound} user interface: No , then you press ninety nine . marketing: Ah uh well whatever , {vocalsound} . user interface: I think go to video is an irrelevant button , but {disfmarker} project manager: Th that's the button uh {disfmarker} No . industrial designer: But it's easy to go {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero . project manager: No you can ch push zero . Yeah . Yeah , industrial designer: It's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button . project manager: I I think that one button is uh {disfmarker} I use it uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons , you have to have uh channel setting , if you wa if you have a new T_V_ . You have to set the channels . project manager: Yeah ? marketing: Right all th these uh different buttons you have to {disfmarker} project manager: These buttons , I don't have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote . industrial designer: Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah , sk {vocalsound} marketing: Ah , I do . {vocalsound} project manager: It's it's incorporated with p m plus and down , uh those {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah well y you must have . industrial designer: Yeah y you you you you have screen width . user interface: Yeah you yeah you have one one button from {vocalsound} s set frequency o or something , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh {disfmarker} marketing: Right . That's the only one we put uh in there . project manager: So we still {gap} have one uh four ? marketing: For a screen uh fu uh channel setting . project manager: Ch ch industrial designer: Yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: Programme , right . project manager: Okay . Oh the Okay button ? {vocalsound} marketing: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu . user interface: Yeah , alright . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Menu button . industrial designer: You should {disfmarker} Yeah . I think that's important . project manager: Channel , setting , menu . industrial designer: Uh {disfmarker} {gap} And and the settings to change the brightness {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} We have to go . {vocalsound} industrial designer: the settings to change the brightness and the contrast . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Channel , yeah . project manager: So um Save . marketing: {gap} industrial designer: Chief ? Chief ? project manager: Yes see . industrial designer: Th the menu menu button is also important . project manager: Yes I have put it in . industrial designer: Then you can uh {disfmarker} Where ? {vocalsound} I don't see it . project manager: Here . industrial designer: Oh Menu , alright . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu , yeah . industrial designer: In the menu . And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something . user interface: Yeah , the {disfmarker} project manager: Alright . industrial designer: Because uh the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu . user interface: Or the volume or something like that . project manager: Guys ? industrial designer: Yeah . Or the volume , yeah . project manager: We're going to uh go to our uh rooms , and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think . So {disfmarker} user interface: Your pen . marketing: Ah . Great . industrial designer: Yes chief . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Alright . project manager: Well see you uh {disfmarker} user interface: I thought we'd uh lunch uh right now , or not ? project manager: W w we have lunchtime , by the way , now uh so uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah this is this is your thing . user interface: Yeah , lunch break . marketing: Ah . Okay . {gap} industrial designer: I am hungry . {vocalsound} project manager: Lunch . marketing: {vocalsound} Get into my belly . {vocalsound} project manager: Ah . We didn't exactly do everything but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} user interface: {gap} {vocalsound} industrial designer: See you later mate . {vocalsound}
