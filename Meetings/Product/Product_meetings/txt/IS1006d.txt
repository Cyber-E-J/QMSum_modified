project manager: Mm . marketing: So , project manager: So , uh now {vocalsound} marketing: Hi Christa . {vocalsound} project manager: it's the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Hi Sammy . {vocalsound} It's the detail design meeting , so we're going {disfmarker} last meeting . So um , first uh Mark and Rama are going to present uh the prototype . Uh then uh Sammy will propose some uh crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . Then , w we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yes . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yes . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} And then we going to do some finance to see if uh it is uh feasible user interface: And chocolate ? {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} and uh at the end we will we will um evaluate ourself as a team . {vocalsound} And that's all . Okay . So first , {vocalsound} let's uh see the prototype . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh , here we have our prototype model . project manager: Okay . And you have some slides then ? user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah , we have also some slides . project manager: {gap} Yeah . Mm . user interface: Yes , and place some slides . project manager: Okay . Uh so in which uh {disfmarker} user interface: Uh , participant three . {vocalsound} Prototype . industrial designer: In {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: Mm okay . Mm . industrial designer: Five . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Uh , so this is our remote control . industrial designer: Him . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: It's a r working prototype . You can use it now by switching all these buttons . So first , I present as we came to this perfect model , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: and then we'll give some technical specifications . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: That's {vocalsound} well {vocalsound} {vocalsound} , so that's that . Please , next slide . We analysed all the fruits project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: and contacted NASA , and uh made some {vocalsound} real good {disfmarker} project manager: MASA ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . If you can see this , and the stars are showing that {gap} . And um , {vocalsound} s society will accept that . For sure . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: {vocalsound} And making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and uh ultimate smell of it . S please , next slide . But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it's the most of the moder the m the {gap} modern material we can p select . And it's practical . And it's still say it's for our needs , so please press something . And as I said , {vocalsound} it's perfect . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Please press it . industrial designer: Experience . Explanat user interface: Everyone is {gap} f really uh really glad to obtain an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} s such a r such a device . marketing: Such a nice thing . {vocalsound} industrial designer: See this {gap} . {vocalsound} user interface: So you can touch it with your hands . marketing: Can I ? user interface: Sure . Yes . {vocalsound} industrial designer: You can {disfmarker} marketing: Ho-ho . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} imitating flatulence] {vocalsound} project manager: What do you say ? {vocalsound} user interface: N marketing: It says {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} You must say it . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Spongy . marketing: I will uh {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} One day . marketing: I'll buy it . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: If I if I need so . {vocalsound} project manager: He {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: Hopefully my daughter will like it . {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . Y and we got the answer . Uh , it is , yes , of course . marketing: Yes , of course . Of c course . {vocalsound} user interface: {gap} , please next slide . Um , this is a prototype . You can have a look at it , and {disfmarker} That's all I wanted to say . marketing: Ah . user interface: Now it's technical specification by our colleague . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: Hmm . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} marketing: Oh , there is {vocalsound} a button missing . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} industrial designer: This this is really flexible . You can add your buttons . marketing: It's in option . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . So function , mm {disfmarker} project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} So , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this {vocalsound} jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . {vocalsound} Then you ha you'll have volume control . So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: And we have some L_C_D_ controls . Like , m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_ , or you don't want you can just use normal button . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: And we have speech recognition . Here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise . marketing: Hmm . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: And it can also do the action . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: And location finder . And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . You can just say , where is my remote control . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Or uh , you can just give some nickname to your remote control , like Bobby {gap} . project manager: {vocalsound} Bobby . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . marketing: {vocalsound} Hey , babe . industrial designer: {vocalsound} And then , {vocalsound} it will say hi . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Bob . {vocalsound} Hey Bob . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , hi , and then you can use it . {vocalsound} marketing: Okay , project manager: Hmm . {vocalsound} 'Kay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: that's good . industrial designer: So , {vocalsound} um our team is now fruits . Mainly strawberry . So , you can {vocalsound} have {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Oh , these are strawberries . {vocalsound} industrial designer: And then you can see the look L_C_D_ and all the switches . project manager: {vocalsound} Are colourful . Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Material , we want to stick to titanium . {vocalsound} We will send , we want to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Fruit smelling spongy titanium . {vocalsound} I didn't know it exist , but that's great . industrial designer: Yeah , or s {vocalsound} So , we want to have {vocalsound} simple and perfect shapes , like I shown in these phones . You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours . marketing: Ha . project manager: Ho-ho . That's for the L_C_D_ or for the titanium ? marketing: You mean we can change the colour uh of th industrial designer: For the L_C_D_ . marketing: Yeah . Yeah okay , for the L_C_D_ . industrial designer: With titanium it's {disfmarker} it is silver . marketing: Tit titanium is {disfmarker} user interface: We are still working on titanium . project manager: Mm-mm . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: So , r we'll start with L_C_D_ . marketing: Uh , okay . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm , yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: You can ask Bob . It's Tuesday . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Hey , you know you're theme today . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , Bob , please . {vocalsound} {gap} Tuesday colour . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . Even you can configure your colours for its {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} depending on your mood , or s marketing: Okay . project manager: Hmm . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Black for Sunday . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} And you can have many colours on weekends . Or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: And w wait , wh what are the strawberries for ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wh wh industrial designer: Huh ? marketing: On the L_C_D_ ? industrial designer: Ah , these are like sensors . marketing: Oh . project manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Of course . user interface: That's location sensors . marketing: {vocalsound} What do you think ? {vocalsound} Strawberry sensors . {vocalsound} Very useful . project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Strawberries . industrial designer: So , {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: after this meeting we'll propose a party for our success for {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Ah . {vocalsound} marketing: Lounge meeting . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} So , if you are vegetarian or you have any options , please let us know . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , and we can just {gap} some strawberry first . Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} marketing: Alright . Good . {vocalsound} user interface: Oops . industrial designer: S marketing: So , huh . Interesting . In interesting . Mm mm . project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: So , any specific questions for {disfmarker} project manager: we'll see in the financial part if uh {vocalsound} all {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} gets into {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} It makes sense . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Let's make a party first maybe . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} W Who is the five uh {disfmarker} fifty millions we {vocalsound} first make a party in ? industrial designer: Yeah . Then we can discuss {disfmarker} We can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , then we can have how much for how money is left . {vocalsound} marketing: So uh , this is {disfmarker} project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: What a design . project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Uh , so {disfmarker} Let's uh , marketing: {vocalsound} It's my turn . project manager: yeah , let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium . {vocalsound} marketing: Mm-hmm . Let's see if this {disfmarker} Yeah , if you meet {vocalsound} the evaluation criterion . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Oops . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Fudge . marketing: Yeah . So , evaluation please . So . You made a very nice prototype , and um , I think , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our {disfmarker} what we want to do , and things like that . So mm {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , next slide , please . {vocalsound} As you know , before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} remote control , it's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have a chance to sell it . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: Uh , so we need to evaluate it um , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can . To {disfmarker} so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . And seven meaning , no it doesn't fulfil at all . And we're all l going to list all the criterion . I'm going to go to that next slide , project manager: Okay . marketing: and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven . And then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our uh remote control . So , maybe we can have a look at the criteria ? industrial designer: Fancy . marketing: So these are the criterion uh I'm {disfmarker} I thought were important . Of course , this can be discussed , but let's let's see , so let's vote . So we have fancy here and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Huh . marketing: So , industrial designer: Yeah , what's is really {disfmarker} marketing: what do you think , is it fancy ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh , it's really {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Uh , I think that fancy , we can say it is fancy . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} It is very very fancy . Or have you ever seen something like that ? {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Oh . I am not the d the only one choosing , yeah . marketing: Yeah , of course . project manager: Uh what do you think ? marketing: What do you think ? user interface: Feel the weight . marketing: Is it {disfmarker} The weight is later . industrial designer: Yeah . Oh . user interface: Really . {vocalsound} project manager: Uh-huh . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} we're {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . marketing: We're on the fanciness now . I think it's quite fancy . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: We can give at least five or six , seven . marketing: It's uh {disfmarker} Yeah , so {disfmarker} No it's it's one . project manager: It's in the other {gap} . industrial designer: Oh , {gap} Oh . So {disfmarker} Oh , okay . Yeah , okay . Oh , okay . So {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , o one means it's , yes , a very fancy and seven mean no at all . project manager: Mm . {vocalsound} marketing: So it's one or two . project manager: Two . Let's say two , yeah . industrial designer: M maybe two . marketing: What do you think ? Two ? user interface: Two . Two . marketing: Okay . So here , two . Up . industrial designer: Technology . marketing: Then we have uh technology . industrial designer: Yeah . Um {disfmarker} marketing: So , what about technology ? We have uh we have speech recognition , we have location based {gap} , industrial designer: And we have L_C_D_ . marketing: we have L_C_D_ . project manager: Change colour of t industrial designer: So you change colours . marketing: Change colour , I mean that's very {disfmarker} industrial designer: Useful . project manager: Yeah , I think it's a {disfmarker} marketing: Quite user interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah . marketing: d I think it's a one for that , at least . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: Yeah . Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . It's silly . marketing: At least a one , yeah . project manager: Mm-mm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: Robustness , uh-huh . industrial designer: Uh , still we need to cha {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} let's suppose my daughter take it and um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} and through it away . project manager: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} marketing: Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again ? Uh , maybe not the prototype . project manager: The strawberries {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Oh . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Let's try . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Oh my god . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Maybe strawberry . marketing: Okay , we just lost one strawberry . user interface: No . industrial designer: Oh . marketing: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: No . How can I say this . marketing: Not at all ? industrial designer: Yeah , we can easily plug it . user interface: It's still it's still working , and your daughter got a bonus . marketing: It is {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} A strawberry . marketing: So it's not so bad . project manager: Mm-mm . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . marketing: I um uh I would say three . project manager: Yeah . But it's too {gap} . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: It's um robust , yeah . marketing: Yeah , that does make sense , yeah ? industrial designer: Useful ? marketing: Useful . {vocalsound} Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? industrial designer: Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} marketing: So I don't know . These buttons are uh {disfmarker} It not clear . project manager: Oh , yeah , lets me try . marketing: But you have at least uh next produce . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: What is uh next , please ? industrial designer: Yeah , channel . I this is volume control and channel changes . These are the main {disfmarker} marketing: Uh , it depends on the {disfmarker} project manager: And you can uh do di two sites ? marketing: Okay . industrial designer: You {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah , and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option . project manager: Okay , also . industrial designer: So if you don't want {disfmarker} marketing: So but , for instance , because the L_C_D_ is not uh touch control , touch screen , you cannot go to channel twenty five directly . industrial designer: Yeah , um {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: You can , by using the {disfmarker} user interface: You can . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Directly . user interface: You go {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} project manager: You c push here the the {disfmarker} user interface: So , the basic mode {disfmarker} project manager: yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . So that's simple . The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial . marketing: Yeah . user interface: With two buttons , you do this like uh volume up , volume down . marketing: Oh , it's a jog dial , okay . user interface: Or if you go to the site , it's channel up channel down . industrial designer: And channel . marketing: Uh-huh . Okay . user interface: And if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this . marketing: Yeah . user interface: You select twenty , you select five . industrial designer: You can select . marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . user interface: That's it . industrial designer: Yeah mm . marketing: It's much longer than that that being two two five , no ? user interface: No . marketing: Don't you think so ? May {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} okay , we can go . That's uh {disfmarker} You're right . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah , yeah . Y you need to like press two and five and {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: That's {disfmarker} it's less uh {disfmarker} Yeah . But it's it's nice , because people anyway don't go there . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . Yeah mm . marketing: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So what do you think for it , usefulness ? industrial designer: So , d Yeah , we need to address {disfmarker} we want {disfmarker} marketing: Seems to be useful . {vocalsound} industrial designer: we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_ . So project manager: {vocalsound} Let me understand well , industrial designer: so {disfmarker} project manager: because I'm not sure {disfmarker} that's for {disfmarker} that this one are b d uh two dir directional button . marketing: Both . Yeah . Yeah . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . Up . marketing: Up down or left right . Yeah . project manager: Yeah . And which {disfmarker} what is that ? user interface: It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen . industrial designer: This is jog wheel . marketing: That {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , okay . It's a kind {disfmarker} Oh , okay okay . {vocalsound} user interface: Like , selecting the menus . industrial designer: Yeah . Um , {vocalsound} see in L_C_D_ , like you will have blocks and you select which one . marketing: Cool . project manager: Oh oh okay , great . marketing: I would say then uh {disfmarker} {gap} project manager: Now it's looks us useful . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: Two or three ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: Two or three ? industrial designer: Two , maybe . {vocalsound} marketing: Two . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: Okay , two . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So size and weight . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . {gap} marketing: Is it the the the effective size and weight that the {disfmarker} Is it uh real size , real weight ? Or {disfmarker} Because it {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , it's {disfmarker} size al almost {gap} {disfmarker} marketing: Size is going to be that , yeah ? industrial designer: Yeah , because it is {disfmarker} marketing: Uh , and and {disfmarker} industrial designer: The weight will be bit lighter . We will s We use titanium . user interface: Sure , project manager: Mm-mm . user interface: without titanium alloy , it's going to be light . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . marketing: It's going to be lighter , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Of course . marketing: because this seems to be very heavy f I mean , industrial designer: Heavy . Yeah . marketing: for my daughter , for instance . project manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Not sure if uh {vocalsound} she can use it . {vocalsound} industrial designer: But sides {disfmarker} uh , the sides should be okay . {gap} . Yeah marketing: So , should be okay . industrial designer: mm . marketing: Up to three for that , project manager: Mm-mm . marketing: because I'm {disfmarker} haven't seen the weight so I must not uh {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Oh . marketing: Colour and shape . project manager: {vocalsound} Uh-oh . {vocalsound} marketing: Well , so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_ . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: But um , it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh {vocalsound} the case . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: The case is silver titanium , no ? marketing: It's a {disfmarker} it's going to be titanium . Okay , okay . project manager: Yeah , it's {gap} . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: That's nice . project manager: Let's imagine . marketing: {vocalsound} I think it's good . Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} And what about the strawberries on the top ? {vocalsound} I'm not convince . {vocalsound} But maybe I'm not trendy . But , uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yahoo . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well y you know , it's this uh fruit and vegetable year . industrial designer: Oh . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} uh they're not useful . marketing: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: I I mean it {disfmarker} that's uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} So maybe , I think {disfmarker} marketing: Uh , I think usefulness is m as as I rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yep . industrial designer: Yeah , well {disfmarker} marketing: Whether it's fancy or not now , it {disfmarker} we have to decide . project manager: Hmm . industrial designer: Yeah . Um {disfmarker} marketing: But this project manager: I would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful . marketing: If it's {disfmarker} Uh-huh . So , that they will {disfmarker} that maybe the fruit may be here instead . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , well then it's bit difficult to use . Not like this d We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too . project manager: Mm-hmm . But the n {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: So it's {disfmarker} marketing: So , it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Even {disfmarker} project manager: No , I'm not sure uh why {disfmarker} industrial designer: These buttons {disfmarker} project manager: uh if it was like this {disfmarker} industrial designer: {gap} But it looks really {vocalsound} not really good . project manager: I It's {gap} n {vocalsound} no , it's not fancy any more . industrial designer: I mean , the f Yeah . So these are kind of rubber things . Even if you lose one you can just put whatever . project manager: Okay . user interface: And {disfmarker} industrial designer: Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and {disfmarker} project manager: Uh-huh . And different routes . Okay , I see what {disfmarker} user interface: Moreover , moreover it covers it covers all the end goals . Even if it is , you know , it's very rounded , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: but still you got some rubber fruit here , and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so you you you feel like it's something uh a protection for the remote control . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , we've {disfmarker} yeah we have sensors here and so here and here , project manager: Also . industrial designer: so we just {disfmarker} Yeah , so even if you don't put , it works . But this is really fancy . {gap} project manager: Okay . marketing: I suggested three . project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} marketing: Because uh , everybody s doesn't seem to be convince , user interface: Okay . Okay . marketing: although it's quite {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: You have good arguments . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: But {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: And uh the last one is adaptive . This is not r maybe not as important as the other one , {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use ? user interface: Sure , sure , just look at it . {vocalsound} It's full adaptable . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Great . project manager: {vocalsound} Wow , that's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Fully adaptable . user interface: Yeah , you can fit it into your palm , you know . marketing: That's {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} So you can fit into your palm , okay . project manager: Yea industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: That {disfmarker} industrial designer: You can {disfmarker} marketing: What else can we need ? industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: You {disfmarker} Do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well ? project manager: Yeah , it's fudge titanium . {vocalsound} You know . marketing: {vocalsound} It's fudge , yeah , yeah . project manager: Right , yeah . {vocalsound} And uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Mm , {gap} {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , fruit titanium , yeah . Well , I if if this is {disfmarker} if you are ready to do that , then I think it deserves a one . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Let's go for one . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Now we have to do the average . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Three , three , six , eight , eleven . marketing: {vocalsound} Who is good in math ? {vocalsound} user interface: It's two point one seven . marketing: Okay . {vocalsound} Two point one seven . That's nice . Two point one seven out of seven . industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: I think we have a good good thing . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Well , that's all I had to say about the evaluation . project manager: So it's a good evaluation . marketing: So {disfmarker} It seems to be good , yeah . project manager: Yeah . Mm . industrial designer: Yeah mm . marketing: We have uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , two one one seven , we have . So {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Mm-mm . marketing: Yeah . Okay . Thanks . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . So now , it has to fulfil the {vocalsound} financial criterium ? marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Financi marketing: Ah-ha . project manager: So , I have an {disfmarker} Here . Um {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Energy . marketing: So so how many batteries do we need ? industrial designer: Uh , we use bat One battery . marketing: One battery ? project manager: Okay , industrial designer: Yep . project manager: so two . marketing: Good . Why two ? industrial designer: Oh , we just need one , I guess . marketing: {vocalsound} Say no . No , ne never install . project manager: Uh-huh . {vocalsound} marketing: Two batteries or one ? project manager: {vocalsound} Oh . industrial designer: No , number is one . We need only one battery . project manager: Yeah yeah , marketing: Only one . project manager: but the price is two . Oh , number . marketing: No , no . But no , no . No , no way . project manager: Sorry sorry sorry . I'm sorry . user interface: No , uh you just {disfmarker} industrial designer: Number , number . user interface: Number . Yeah . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . Oh . marketing: Yeah .
