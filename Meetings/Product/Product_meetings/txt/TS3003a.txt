project manager: So uh good morning . user interface: Morning . marketing: Morning . project manager: I see you all find your places . industrial designer: Morning . project manager: Is everybody sitting on the right place ? Yeah ? marketing: Yep . project manager: I guess so . So {disfmarker} Let's see . First I will introduce myself . I don't know if uh {disfmarker} if everybody knows me , so I'm Bart , marketing: My name's Frank . project manager: hello . Hello . user interface: I'm {gap} . project manager: Bart . Hello . Hello . Bart . industrial designer: {gap} project manager: Welcome . marketing: Thank you . project manager: Uh let's see . Uh let's start off um with a little presentation . Uh Now first I'll tell you a little bit about the setting . You can see there are a few cameras here . They'll record uh our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice . Uh there are also some microphones there but th um you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those , because it will uh disappear when you don't attend to it . So is there a project documents folder ? There are some notes in it already I see , some documents . Uh I'll start with the presentation kick off . Is being modified by the administrator . Uh okay {vocalsound} . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Hmm , that's interesting . project manager: Let's do it read only . Well I don't know if you've noticed , but uh we're working for Real Reaction . Uh it's a company in uh electronics . We put fashion in electronics , uh we make it work , uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself . I'm Bart {gap} the project manager so I'll direct you through the project . This is our agenda . {vocalsound} Uh we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh maybe I can sit down , then I can take some notes or {disfmarker} Let's see . Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while . marketing: Sure . project manager: I dunno it's not a lot of work , but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down , just write it down . Uh as you can see uh it's the opening , aquaintance tool training . Aquaintance is a point we've done a bit . Um have you all seen the corporate website already ? Yeah . user interface: Yep . marketing: Yep . Visit it . project manager: Have you seen any flaws in it ? I think I found one . {vocalsound} No ? user interface: Hmm ? marketing: Can't say I paid much attention to it , project manager: I can see if it works this way . No , it doesn't work here . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay no problem . But um on the corporate information side there's a th uh {disfmarker} there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction . marketing: Oh yeah . project manager: Real Remote is not really the company we're {disfmarker} we are , but it's just a little {gap} fault . user interface: Okay . Yeah . project manager: Um okay , what are we going to do ? {vocalsound} Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control . It has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . So these are uh the points why uh we also hired you . {vocalsound} We've got the Marketing Expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look . marketing: Okay . project manager: And Industrial Designer uh there's also user friendly and a bit original . {vocalsound} And we've got our User Interface Designer . user interface: Yep . project manager: He's also uh {disfmarker} That's about the new remote control . Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through . First is functional des uh design , individual work , meetings . After the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design . {vocalsound} I had some role indications on here . But I think you know it already by yourself . The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design , uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design . Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design . {vocalsound} And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project {disfmarker} uh product ev evaluation . So that's a bit what you're going to do . But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Then we've got our first tool training . {vocalsound} We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here , so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first . As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board . Um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side . Here are some functions . You can save . N uh these functions we don't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little uh piece of drawing . A blank new document for each person . Uh select a pen , eraser . Capture we don't have to do anything with . Uh then we've got our pen . This pen . It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page um in the {disfmarker} think it is form of . marketing: 'Kay . project manager: You can also select the current colour and the line width . But then first you have to select the pen function . user interface: Hmm . project manager: But we're going to work with it in a minute . So okay . Uh that's very simple and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there . {vocalsound} Uh then a short thing about documents . We've got our shared folder , project {gap} project {disfmarker} what was it ? Project documents {gap} I think . But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already , so it will be okay . And these are available on the smart boards as well , so if you have a document you wanna show , just open it from the folder . user interface: Okay . Yeah . project manager: Here is a simple tool bar . It's what I just said , it's save , print , move back or forward one page . You can switch between the different drawings . And then we're going to try out the white board . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} So as you can see we g all {vocalsound} going to draw a animal . {vocalsound} Just to uh uh just to get a bit familiar with it . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Mouse wasn't running away . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: That was interesting . project manager: Is everybody {disfmarker} is anybody playing with the mouse ? No . marketing: {vocalsound} Innocent . project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: We're going to uh draw animal . {vocalsound} And uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours , and different line width . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: Uh there's {disfmarker} I can start from now . I will . You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child . Because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get good . user interface: Okay . marketing: 'Kay . project manager: Another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow . 'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then um the pen won't hold up . So we choose form of current colour uh I think grey is appropriate . Then the line width . I think seven will be nice . Now you'll see my drawing capabilities . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: These are not very much , but uh {disfmarker} Uh , see you have to do it real slow . {vocalsound} Oh {gap} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Sure . project manager: Ah I was trying to draw a dolphin , user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: but I think his nose has to be a little bit {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: But it's close . marketing: I'm thinking about a swordfish . project manager: So what {disfmarker} yeah it's {disfmarker} this is bit of the swordfish . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , he hasn't got an eye . user interface: {gap} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . project manager: Woah . {vocalsound} Now we've got another function . We've got the eraser . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} . project manager: {vocalsound} And then you can undo this easily . marketing: Meat . project manager: Ah it's okay . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: And I've got to write down a few of its characteristics . Uh is {disfmarker} They've got no text tool , no . Uh . {vocalsound} Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: This is typically a undo action , I think . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Pen . Maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down . I think that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe . But I don't know , I'm just trying . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} This is not my work , industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: okay . marketing: Hmm . project manager: Maybe you have to use {disfmarker} Oh . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh . I think it's a {disfmarker} it wants to draw a {disfmarker} another animal ? I don't know . It lives for the fun . So {disfmarker} It's my characteristic uh characteristic about the dolphin . It lives for the fun . So now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you . user interface: Okay . marketing: Okay . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Go ahead . marketing: Thank you . Okay . Gonna use a different line width . And I'm gonna draw in black . There . 'Kay , I'm not much of an artist , but here we go . project manager: Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width , I think . Because this is going a lot better than uh I did . user interface: Hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: A sheep . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: This is my um {disfmarker} Hmm . Sheep . project manager: It's nice . {vocalsound} marketing: With of course project manager: {vocalsound} Uh . marketing: little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts . project manager: {vocalsound} It's a real dead sheep , user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: There . project manager: yeah . {vocalsound} For recognition , marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: yeah , I see . {vocalsound} Um maybe you can also write your name somewhere . marketing: 'Kay . project manager: On just a {disfmarker} marketing: They are {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Come on . You have to go really slow when you're writing . project manager: Yeah . marketing: They're brilliant animal animals . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: And that's just a little me thingy . So . Guess I'll pass the pen to our User Interface Designer . project manager: Nice . user interface: Okay . Um I'm just gonna draw its uh head , but mm {disfmarker} Let's see . Mm . Uh . {gap} Okay . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Sweet . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Interesting . user interface: You know what that is ? Or who ? industrial designer: Garfield . marketing: A rabbit ? user interface: Ah okay , yeah . marketing: Garfield . Yeah . user interface: Just a {disfmarker} Mm . Guess . So uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . That's enough . {vocalsound} Um , you say a blank , project manager: Yeah , just a blank sheet . user interface: or {disfmarker} Okay . industrial designer: Well I was gonna draw a cat too , so . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I'll just try something else . project manager: No . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Something different than Garfield . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mine is a bit more skinny . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , it's pretty skinny cat . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} But uh {disfmarker} marketing: And the most interesting tail . project manager: Is your cat , or did you find him on the street ? {gap} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well , it's supposed to be a cat . I like cats because uh they are uh independent . project manager: Ah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: The pen . So . project manager: Okay . That's pretty clear . So everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? So if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: The pen . {vocalsound} project manager: and go ahead . It's pretty uh easy . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} 'Kay . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: S {gap} marketing: We're being haunted . project manager: haunted white board . {vocalsound} So we've got the tool uh introduction . We move along to the project finance . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Um as you can see , we um for our remote control , a selling price is uh twenty five Euros . Our selling price . Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros . Uh that's the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims . Uh we can do it international , so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well . Um but that's all in the later stadium . Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros , so that's also a point we have to keep in mind , that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside , and stuff like that . It won't work . So just try to remember these points . Selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million um , but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on . And production cost uh maximal twelve and a half Euros . So that's leads us to our little discussion . We've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion . So I'm gonna sit down , I think . It's easier . marketing: Yeah , you got a message . project manager: I've got a message . Five minutes . Okay , user interface: Five minutes , okay . project manager: that's uh good timing . {vocalsound} {gap} marketing: So just on a side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen ? user interface: Mm ? project manager: Uh maybe you have to say the magic word . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Right . project manager: Does it do anything ? marketing: No . project manager: Maybe you have to just clap it down ? Mm back up again . No slide show . Hmm . marketing: It's off now . project manager: It's off . Now you have to put it back o Oh yeah . You'll be okay , I think . marketing: Well , it was on , but {disfmarker} project manager: Well it's those laptops . {vocalsound} marketing: Ah , there we are . project manager: Nice . Okay . {vocalsound} But so mm does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls , and I mean not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? Like you can use for other ? marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Mm . Oh really ? project manager: No ? user interface: Huh . project manager: You ? {vocalsound} user interface: It's a {disfmarker} industrial designer: No , me neither . marketing: Well , we have a kind of broad T_V_ at home , and a D_V_D_ player , so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the T_V_ , one for the video recorder , one for the D_V_D_ player . project manager: Ah yeah . marketing: And I think it's {disfmarker} it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all . project manager: Yep . Yeah user interface: Sure . Yeah . project manager: I've I've got one at home . And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else . user interface: Okay , yeah . Yeah . project manager: And it also operates on infra-red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . user interface: Okay , yeah . marketing: Oh project manager: So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or D_V_D_ player downstairs and you've got a link to your T_V_ on the second floor . So that's a pretty handy um marketing: really . user interface: Hmm . Oh . Mm-hmm . marketing: Yeah . project manager: thing . {vocalsound} Um but only the I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as well . It's uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: Oh . project manager: That's good to remember . marketing: So I think you can take minutes again . project manager: Yeah , that's nice , I think . {vocalsound} marketing: Since it's your job . project manager: So we've {disfmarker} we want different functions marketing: Yeah . project manager: uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red . But I don't know if that will exceed the production costs . So that uh that's something we have to find out , I think . user interface: Mm . marketing: Yeah . But that would be really good if we could do that . {vocalsound} project manager: And other functions for a remote control ? Maybe we can make it uh uh user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Um . Think it has to be shock proof user interface: Sure , yeah . marketing: 'cause project manager: Shock proof . marketing: my remote control tends to fall a lot . user interface: Waterproof , or uh {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Sure . user interface: Uh , you never no know uh , marketing: So {disfmarker} user interface: I w I mean uh {disfmarker} project manager: Waterproof . Okay . So these are our um a few things we can think of . Um I will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder . user interface: 'Kay . marketing: Yeah , one other little thing . Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it . project manager: That's a {disfmarker} marketing: So you can see project manager: battery stays . user interface: Okay , yeah . marketing: how much is left in the battery . But they'll also really drag up the production costs , so think we'll have to see about that too . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Mm . project manager: Uh . marketing: But maybe just a little LED , I don't know . project manager: That's an idea as well . Other ideas ? Quick ideas . industrial designer: Nope . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: They were all mentioned , project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: so {disfmarker} project manager: Any questions about this uh presentation ? Kick off presentation . marketing: Um . Nope , don't think so . project manager: No ? user interface: {gap} project manager: Okay , then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder , and then we can all work . Finish meeting now . {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . project manager: And we can all work uh on our own projects . {vocalsound} marketing: Aye sir . project manager: Okay then I'll meet you in about a half an hour , I think . marketing: Half an hour . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: So good luck . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . marketing: Okay . user interface: Yep .
