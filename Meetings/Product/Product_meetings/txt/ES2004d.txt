project manager: If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time . user interface: Hmm . marketing: Is that someone's ? project manager: Is that {gap} . user interface: Thank you . project manager: {gap} three , apparently . user interface: Hmm . Hmm . project manager: Okay , you all switched on . marketing: Okay . user interface: Yep , me too . project manager: I presume we're good to go . Okay , um minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger , user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't uh uh gonna be a problem factor . We wanted a stand-by function . The case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design . Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel . Um {vocalsound} and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . Um {vocalsound} and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_ . Okay ? Prototype presentation . industrial designer: Is that {gap} for us ? user interface: Yep . project manager: I think that would be you . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Me and William worked on a prototype , and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that . industrial designer: Yeah , shall I show ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: I'll show . Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it user interface: I can hold it like {disfmarker} project manager: Make sure the camera's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: and I'll I'll show you the presentation . user interface: so {disfmarker} industrial designer: Can I just nick your {disfmarker} project manager: Yes , yes you can . Wait a second , I'll get it out . user interface: {gap} industrial designer: Whoa . user interface: It looks project manager: Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Going a bit crazy over here . user interface: crazy {gap} . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Thank you . user interface: Um not now . Oh . project manager: {vocalsound} You should have one of those things and you can just take it off . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Ta-da . user interface: Oh , where are the hinges ? {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay , so project manager: Right . industrial designer: this is our look and feel presentation , the final {disfmarker} our final presentation . project manager: Mm 'kay . industrial designer: And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there . Um user interface: 'Kay . You able to look {gap} ? industrial designer: It's gonna have a a plastic body {vocalsound} um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something . user interface: Yep . {gap} industrial designer: This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: um which there'd be sort of a wide choice {disfmarker} they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it . Um {vocalsound} it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} {gap} . industrial designer: and uh {vocalsound} the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um {vocalsound} how do you say , it's {disfmarker} yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top user interface: The black and white touch screen wherein people can {disfmarker} project manager: Mm . So it's flush . industrial designer: and the buttons at the bottom would d user interface: Right . industrial designer: so so it'll fully close flat . project manager: Oh right , okay , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . user interface: {gap} {gap} industrial designer: {vocalsound} And working on the inside we've um already said {disfmarker} d decided on the kinetic batteries , which {disfmarker} actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , so that you could probably get a bit of {disfmarker} project manager: So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: 'cause it's the top part that's {disfmarker} okay . industrial designer: Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in {vocalsound} and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something . marketing: {vocalsound} Or something . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} And then {disfmarker} yeah . It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something . It'll just shout out I'm here , or something to similar effect . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . user interface: 'Kay . project manager: I'm under the sofa . user interface: Ah oka project manager: Or , that would be too complicated . industrial designer: Uh yeah , if it was going like I d well tha that could be something for next time , maybe . You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . Um the standard , there's {disfmarker} be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about . project manager: Infrared {gap} . industrial designer: Um it would it would have {disfmarker} obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate P_C_B_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling . {vocalsound} And uh because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . And the infrared um sender would be on the {disfmarker} on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the {disfmarker} we haven't {disfmarker} I don't think we actually put it on . project manager: Like here . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah , something like that . user interface: Infrared could be here also . Yeah , here . project manager: Okay . Actually , no , it would be {disfmarker} it would have to be on the on the front . industrial designer: Yeah , on the front on the front side of that , yeah . user interface: {gap} . So when it's {disfmarker} even if it's open here , the signals would go {gap} . project manager: Oh right , yeah , okay , yeah , I've got you . It's still pointing , industrial designer: So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ . project manager: yes . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , that would make sense . industrial designer: And then finally um on to the interface . {vocalsound} The top screen , as we said , is {disfmarker} would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen user interface: {gap} This one right here . industrial designer: which {disfmarker} yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect . user interface: {gap} . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: And now we've {disfmarker} we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top . user interface: Which is {disfmarker} project manager: But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product industrial designer: No d not not actually . No , not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing . user interface: No . project manager: once it's {disfmarker} user interface: Look up to it . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics , project manager: Thank you very much . industrial designer: as that is {disfmarker} that's the company logo {gap} . user interface: Yay . project manager: Wrapping it all up , okay . marketing: Well done . project manager: Um I've now got evaluation criteria . marketing: Certainly . user interface: So this is the one . Sorry . project manager: It's to be presented {gap} . industrial designer: There you go . {gap} . marketing: Logged in ? Thank you . Oops . project manager: Okay . user interface: Evaluation . {gap} . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Mm um I I think this is {gap} chip . project manager: It's quite similar to what it was before , though . marketing: Okay . project manager: Sorry . marketing: This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . {vocalsound} So this is the first stage of the evaluation . Now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? Now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those {disfmarker} the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: {vocalsound} The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function . {vocalsound} Okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those . I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned , I'll call that slide back up , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Does that seem clear ? Any questions there ? user interface: Ah , it's perfect . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: we're going to look at these crite So user interface: Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market {disfmarker} marketing: Yes , user interface: okay . industrial designer: {gap} marketing: we're going to come to {disfmarker} w we'll discuss each one project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven . project manager: Okay . marketing: Is that okay ? user interface: 'Kay . marketing: One is true , seven is false . Right . So I won't write all of that out again . It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or A_ , B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ to confuse it with the number rating . B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ . {vocalsound} This is where I realise how tiny I actually am . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Just write small . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Criteria and rating . Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . How about that ? user interface: Yeah , so you can {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . That works . industrial designer: Yeah , okay . marketing: Okay . So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Okay . Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel . How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy {disfmarker} it is a fancy look and feel . One is true , seven is false . My own rating for that would be a two . One is true and seven is false . project manager: {vocalsound} I would agree . industrial designer: Yeah , I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh {vocalsound} two {disfmarker} yeah , marketing: I'll just go this way . project manager: Okay . user interface: 'Kay . industrial designer: two or three . marketing: Two . industrial designer: No , three . Three . marketing: Okay . project manager: I would say two . marketing: Two . user interface: {vocalsound} I would say four . marketing: A four , okay . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Adding those up , we've got a six and a five , eleven divided by four is what ? Uh two and three quarters , it that right . user interface: Almost three . industrial designer: Mm yeah . marketing: Two and three quarters ? user interface: I think yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . marketing: Okay . Two point seven five , there we go . {vocalsound} Okay , criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative . I would give that a three . industrial designer: I'd give it a one . marketing: Okay . Not that you're biased {vocalsound} in that it {disfmarker} the designer . industrial designer: No , no , not at all . project manager: A two . user interface: Oh sorry , I I got it wrong . The first one rating , I'm sorry . Can you just make it two ? The first . marketing: The average {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , I I just {gap} it the other way . marketing: oh , for you ? You want your rating to be a two ? Is that what you're saying ? user interface: Uh in {gap} Yep , I just got {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . user interface: {gap} marketing: So , I'll work out the average for that again at the end . It's a very slightly altered {disfmarker} Okay , user interface: two point f marketing: and we're just waiting for your rating project manager: It's just two point five for that one . marketing: f industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Two point five , okay . Losing one decimal place , that's okay . user interface: One is a {gap} , seven is false , okay . marketing: So what are you rating for this one , Paw ? user interface: Two . marketing: Two , okay . So that is eight . That brings it down to two , industrial designer: Two . marketing: nice and simple , yeah . Okay , ease of use . Easy to use ? Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true . industrial designer: Two . marketing: Two . project manager: I would say a two . I would say a two . marketing: A two , okay . user interface: Two . marketing: Two . I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy , shouldn't I ? user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} We'll just put almost two , project manager: One point seven f five . marketing: because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places . project manager: Okay , mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Okay . Or we {disfmarker} or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later . Um mm now we're looking at industrial designer: D_ . marketing: it incorporates current fashion trends , now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours . industrial designer: One . Yeah . marketing: Right . So I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here . industrial designer: Yeah , that's {disfmarker} marketing: Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ? industrial designer: No , no , the the base colour was um {vocalsound} white or or like or l sort of a light blue , user interface: White . With {disfmarker} for the plastic ? Uh blue . industrial designer: but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any {disfmarker} basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised . marketing: Right . user interface: Any {disfmarker} marketing: So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do . user interface: Right . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah , yeah user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: and {disfmarker} marketing: And the spongy feel is no problem with that . user interface: Yeah , because you'll be having a {disfmarker} Because of the rubber case . industrial designer: No , no , 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that {disfmarker} otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic . marketing: Okay . In that case it's got to be a one for me . industrial designer: Yeah , I'll give it a one as well . marketing: Yep . project manager: One . marketing: Everybody ? Okay . user interface: One . marketing: {vocalsound} That part was nice and easy . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: I don't think we've really touched on that a lot . industrial designer: No . marketing: We've we've discussed it , we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . We've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_ industrial designer: It's meant to be . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: it's meant to . Um marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: maybe because it's slightl industrial designer: {gap} project manager: with the size that we've got it's quite small , industrial designer: {gap} project manager: but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much . marketing: Mm . project manager: So maybe because there's more space , it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between . marketing: Mm-hmm . Right . project manager: It's quite obvious just big buttons . Um {disfmarker} marketing: Right . I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah , I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually , marketing: A five , okay . industrial designer: 'cause {disfmarker} project manager: Four . marketing: Four and a four okay . user interface: Four . marketing: Twenty one {disfmarker} is that twenty one ? user interface: {gap} marketing: So that's four point two five . industrial designer: Yep . marketing: And finally , last but not least , easy to locate . Now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have we really {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? industrial designer: Yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition , user interface: Voice r recognition . marketing: It was the I'm here thing , industrial designer: yeah . marketing: yep . And are we happy with the costs on that ? That is going to be feasible , cost-wise . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah , that {disfmarker} yeah , that's feasible . marketing: That sounds good then . I'd go for a {disfmarker} I ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on T_V_ . So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms , or . industrial designer: Um I think it would r I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand project manager: A standard . industrial designer: it would be quite loud . project manager: It would be . marketing: Right . Okay . industrial designer: So it would be s p marketing: You built into the feature . project manager: And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room . industrial designer: yeah . marketing: Okay . Logical . That's a one for me . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , one . marketing: One project manager: One . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: and one , good . industrial designer: {vocalsound} I do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product , project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} So , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: but {disfmarker} marketing: how do we feel about this ? industrial designer: {gap} {gap} marketing: We've got our our {disfmarker} we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there . That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . {vocalsound} Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ? project manager: I don't think so . industrial designer: W I thin yeah , I think {disfmarker} marketing: We happy to go ahead ? project manager: I think we {disfmarker} yeah . I think we're set . industrial designer: yeah . marketing: Yeah . I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that . project manager: Do much apart from having a huge big {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm . marketing: I know . Okay . Well , I hope that's uh clear to the team . Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before I sum up ? project manager: Don't think so . industrial designer: No . marketing: Good . Fine then . I'll just leave it there . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay , thank you . marketing: Oops . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay , user interface: Hmm . project manager: I've got finance here now . I'm gonna plug this in so you can all see it , if that's okay . Um . marketing: Oh yes . user interface: You want me to b unplug that ? industrial designer: {gap} {gap} user interface: That's all . Yes . project manager: Thanks . Right . user interface: Okay . project manager: Now I presume that the screen will go blank , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: that um {disfmarker} Okay . We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value . So are we still on for kinetic ? industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yes . project manager: Okay . See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . Um it might have influenced our choice . Right , what's happening with the electronics ? industrial designer: It was a regular chip on print user interface: Chip on print . industrial designer: and {disfmarker} project manager: Double-curved . industrial designer: Oh , no , no , no , the um {disfmarker} Yeah , it's {disfmarker} you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one . In the top , it's the number project manager: Oh , right , industrial designer: of c yeah {gap} . project manager: okay . Thanks . industrial designer: Yeah , project manager: So , would there be two ? industrial designer: and {disfmarker} yeah , just a {disfmarker} no , one reg v uh {disfmarker} project manager: One chip . industrial designer: Yeah , one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker . user interface: Okay . project manager: Okay . user interface: Yep . industrial designer: And they're double curved . No . user interface: Single-curved . project manager: One double curve . industrial designer: Y Two , user interface: Two curves , yeah . industrial designer: 'cause it's two . marketing: But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit . So it can rest . project manager: So what's a single curve then ? industrial designer: Yeah , I'd say I'd say it was w marketing: It would just be a flat bottom with one curve . {gap} like a domed thing . industrial designer: yeah , I think I think it's {disfmarker} user interface: Single-cu project manager: So just one double {disfmarker} industrial designer: One double-curved . marketing: Mm . project manager: Yeah . Um {disfmarker} user interface: {gap} . industrial designer: And one {disfmarker} user interface: Plastic and rubber . industrial designer: no , 'cause one {disfmarker} yeah , one's double-curved , and then the other one's marketing: The other curves at the sides , but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over . Yeah . project manager: Mm . {vocalsound} Um we've got plastic and rubber , industrial designer: a plastic . project manager: haven't we ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Plastic one and maybe rubber point five . industrial designer: And special colour . project manager: {vocalsound} {gap} . user interface: No I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing , project manager: Um {disfmarker} user interface: we can put point five . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Do you think ? user interface: Yeah , I think it allows the point five , yeah . We can use that . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: What does it mean if you put point five for that ? user interface: It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually . We're using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic . project manager: It would be like saying we're using {disfmarker} See , it says case material . So marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: we're not actually using plastic in the case , are we ? industrial designer: No , no , that's {disfmarker} it's as an extra . project manager: It's including , it's including . marketing: Right , okay . industrial designer: So that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there , because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get . marketing: But it is gonna be part of the total cost , and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in , is there ? industrial designer: {gap} marketing: There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing . So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ? project manager: Okay , we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half . marketing: Okay . project manager: Or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway . industrial designer: Yeah , okay . marketing: Mm . project manager: No , we don't step on anyone's toes . Okay , special colour , do we need that ? marketing: Might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours . project manager: N yeah , okay . {vocalsound} Interface . user interface: Push-button . industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: One . industrial designer: the push-button's one and L_C_ display one . user interface: An One . project manager: Buttons {disfmarker} industrial designer: And buttons {disfmarker} marketing: S user interface: {vocalsound} I think we could change the battery also . Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery . marketing: Has that not made any d if you click off that square now , has that not made any difference ? project manager: Has that not gone up ? industrial designer: Well yes . marketing: Is it {disfmarker} oh , it's brought it slightly down . project manager: Oh no , it was seven five it's changed not a lot . marketing: So is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: is that going to make a difference ? user interface: Uncurved , flat . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Oh , it's not made any difference , has it? . user interface: No , industrial designer: No , user interface: it just surprises one . industrial designer: we'll have {disfmarker} marketing: It's gone up again . project manager: Oh , it's not calculated it . industrial designer: No , no , you've got to click off to calculate it again . marketing: Oh . project manager: Okay , there we go . marketing: {vocalsound} It's brought it down slightly . project manager: {vocalsound} It's not a lot though . user interface: {gap} . {vocalsound} I don't think so . industrial designer: C it might uh you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros . It could be in Dollars . And then it would be fine , because the exchange range would make it about twelve . project manager: We haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though , marketing: Is there anything on the menu {disfmarker} project manager: I think {disfmarker} marketing: No . industrial designer: {vocalsound} No . user interface: Ri I think it's in Euro {gap} . project manager: Okay , so the highest we've got is the electronics here . Um {vocalsound} and the interface . marketing: If we tr um . If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ? user interface: And going to a regular bat Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , the standard , it {vocalsound} um it would make one difference . The biggest one would be taking away {disfmarker} if you took away {disfmarker} user interface: What I feel is , customers never said anything about the battery {gap} . industrial designer: If you to user interface: It's internal , nobody looks into the battery . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: But shape and colours , that's something we shouldn't comprimi marketing: And people are used to buying batteries , industrial designer: If if you take away the voice , marketing: they're not gonna say I'm not getting this , 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control . industrial designer: I I do I don't like to say it , but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it . user interface: Where's that special form ? Mm mm mm . marketing: Should we see what difference it makes ? project manager: Where's the industrial designer: Yeah i yeah . project manager: where's the voice recognition ? industrial designer: No 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker . marketing: Um {disfmarker} project manager: Right , okay . industrial designer: If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five . project manager: Well the kinetic is three . If we change it to the battery it's {disfmarker} that's minus three . industrial designer: They {vocalsound} n n yeah , but you p minus three plus two . project manager: Oh , right . I keep seeing zero . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We can do it some other way , user interface: {gap} project manager: we can do {disfmarker} it doesn't have to be voice recognition . We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: You could choose to have that or not . marketing: Sure . industrial designer: But they {disfmarker} but I mean in {disfmarker} I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product . marketing: But we're still working to um head o project manager: So should we just change the design specification then ? {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Make it costly . marketing: We can put in our recommendations . If we if we're working to head office specifications as {disfmarker} this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we {disfmarker} the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings . project manager: Yes . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: We c we could s marketing: But we need to work to that specification to start with . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah , we could say {disfmarker} marketing: And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful , but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance . Um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers project manager: Okay , we can make the price fit , industrial designer: Yeah , I s project manager: and then say if we'd had our budget , we would've had this , industrial designer: And then say we recommend {disfmarker} marketing: Mm . project manager: because it also sets it apart from the crowd . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . 'Cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it . project manager: They like their gadgets , they like something that's completely different . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: It's {vocalsound} s something completely different associated with your company . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Right , okay , so {disfmarker} marketing: So if we take voice recognition out {disfmarker} industrial designer: That'll do it . Twelve point three five . user interface: Yeah we are close to the budget . marketing: {gap} we are . industrial designer: Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ? user interface: Two five . project manager: It's two point five . No , it's twelve point two five . marketing: Are you sure ? Sorry , not meaning to doubt your words there . project manager: Yeah well two , twelve point two five times two is twenty five , marketing: Right . {vocalsound} Are they really going to quibble about ten P_ ? Or point zero one of a Euro ? user interface: It's twelve point five maybe , then . project manager: isn't it ? marketing: Which is less than ten P_ . user interface: I don't know what {disfmarker} it said fifty percent of the cost . So half of the price would be {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} I think the agenda one was where the um price was , wasn't it ? No . user interface: I think it is the first one . marketing: That's today's kick off meeting , {gap} . project manager: Twelve point five . marketing: Mm . {gap} I thought that's what it was . user interface: So we are under the budget . project manager: {gap} industrial designer: Ah . project manager: Well done , people . marketing: So we're okay . project manager: So industrial designer: Okay . project manager: is that uh got us covered for the electronics then ? We don't need something else to take that place ? industrial designer: Yeah . No . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: 'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra , you could just take that out and that would be fine , yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . user interface: Seems fine . industrial designer: Yeah , I think that's brilliant . user interface: Except voice recognition , everything is {disfmarker} project manager: Right , so we've done that . Okay . Product evaluation . We've done room for creativity , haven't we ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't {disfmarker} didn't feel able to make . Um industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yes . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . project manager: um in the sense that um did you feel like a team ? Or did you feel like {vocalsound} uh autonomy ? industrial designer: Yeah , I'd say , as a team . user interface: I think we had a nice time . marketing: Although we had our separate tasks , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: there was so much interaction , so much that we needed to um bounce off each other . industrial designer: Find out from each other , yeah . marketing: And I've certainly felt heard , listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to , you know , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody . It's not like people trying to cut each other . There is more of uh true cohesive teamwork . We came to a very predic creative design , yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , I think . And Sarah , you coordinated the work very well . project manager: Thank you . How did you find it ? industrial designer: Yeah , no , I thought it it went really well and I yeah , I I feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out , although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there , but that's that's good . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually {disfmarker} if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , I think maybe it would've come out a d little different , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: but {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: you know , y it didn't matter it saying what you thought , because if it wasn't something that was that relevant , then it didn't matter , 'cause it was just another idea in the field . I like that . Um industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Yeah . project manager: teamwork . Well you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , well . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: I think that was the best part project manager: Um {vocalsound} uh I'm still not caught up . user interface: of the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {gap} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} But that's nothing to do with the teamwork at all . Um {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {gap} marketing: Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line . And fake R_C_s . project manager: Maybe . user interface: 'Kay . project manager: No , that was quite fun . Um {vocalsound} means , whiteboard , digital pens , etcetera , what does that mean ? Any ideas ? user interface: {gap} industrial designer: {gap} Discuss which ones {disfmarker} marketing: How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ? industrial designer: yeah . Yeah . marketing: Could it've been better , was it adequate ? industrial designer: Yeah , I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more , had we actually had had more time and if we'd been separated more . project manager: Had time to kind of {disfmarker} marketing: Mm . project manager: Yeah , 'cause we could just sort of say , sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that , rather than having to email it , industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: But it was nice having it there . Um like the whole picture of the thing . user interface: Yeah , {gap} moving around the room . {vocalsound} But I think it's good , marketing: Yeah . user interface: like uh we spent times individually . I never thought of a remote control with a flip top . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , I think it's new ideas in general , marketing: It's really borrowing from other areas , it's , you know , bringing things from other areas in , project manager: rather than {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: it so it's {disfmarker} I mean nothing is new , project manager: Mm . marketing: but it's applying it to a d in a different area . industrial designer: Vegetables . user interface: {vocalsound} That's mine . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , no . Well user interface: Yeah , it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: they have to come from somewhere , don't they ? marketing: Absolutely , yeah . user interface: The thing is {disfmarker} project manager: And as sh as w sorry , user interface: Yep , sorry , project manager: you go . user interface: go on Sarah . project manager: Um as was shown by {vocalsound} your presentation with all of the other controls , remote controls , no one's thought about it particularly . industrial designer: No . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: I mean they're slightly different , so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's , 'cause it's w something we should think about , marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , I do I don't think the the companies are really concerned . They're just like we've got a D_V_D_ player , does anyone remember the remote control ? Can't you get the one that we used for the last one ? Yeah , just jazz it up a bit . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: Uh d they don't really think about it , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: because normally , the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship . They're trying to ship the D_V_D_ player , the video player , the T_V_ . marketing: Yeah , the focus isn't on to that , yeah . project manager: But then when it everything is really smart , and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table , it doesn't go , industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: I mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing , a funky item that's individual , individual to you , industrial designer: No . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: I mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic , you would pray {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: you would pay a lot extra , because it's individually being {disfmarker} a plastic was being made for you . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: But people could {gap} have anything that they wanted . industrial designer: Mm . user interface: Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like a real want to see a new launch or something like that . project manager: Because of the produ Mm . user interface: And new f television products coming up , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: but nobody giving uh much idea to this . Like Sarah was telling , everything's {disfmarker} marketing: I think it's really good that this has been very market research based , user interface: Right . marketing: because {vocalsound} just going back to mobile phones , I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible . We see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from . There are innovations in that that people don't really want . project manager: Yes . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , and they can't get it anymore project manager: Yeah . marketing: and it's innovation for innovation's sake , and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Well , it's innovation for money's sake . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: The the people have to keep buying . marketing: But forcing it onto people , project manager: Yeah . marketing: yeah . It's things that , you know , they might want to buy the thing they really want . project manager: And you can't get {disfmarker} you've got your handset that works fine , but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone , marketing: Mm . Mm . project manager: because the phones have moved on , things like that . marketing: Or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever , project manager: Yes . marketing: yeah . project manager: It's madness . Um {disfmarker} marketing: See I think {disfmarker} project manager: In closing {disfmarker} There we go . user interface: {gap} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Um {vocalsound} our costs are below budget with recommendations that they {disfmarker} the budget be increased , but I think {disfmarker} I don't know , d what do you think ? Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ? And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ? user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well . marketing: I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone . industrial designer: I think that was just the the physical . project manager: So it looks {disfmarker} well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit , you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: So maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Maybe fifty percent more . project manager: But I think {disfmarker} but you were saying that that's quite {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , I think {disfmarker} yeah I don't {disfmarker} from the market research . marketing: But I think in the remit that we were given , it was very specific . I think we've done what we were required to do , project manager: Hmm . marketing: and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things . I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: No . Yeah , it was {disfmarker} marketing: I think we've done very well to get within budget project manager: Mm . marketing: and it still makes such an innovative item project manager: Yeah . marketing: that I think people are really gonna want . user interface: Yeah . project manager: It's a shame it won't ever get made . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: I know . user interface: Who knows ? project manager: Maybe it will . marketing: Maybe it will . Maybe they are gonna steal our ideas project manager: Maybe someone'll r run down and patent it . industrial designer: I it's top secret . Um it's it is it's a conspiracy going on here . That's what it is . marketing: and sell it . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Um the project has been evaluated well and truly . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: There's a final questionnaire . project manager: Oh , so we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with {vocalsound} {vocalsound} everything that I fell behind with , industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} In your {disfmarker} project manager: so I'll be delegating in my um role as Project Supervisor , industrial designer: yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: so good luck . user interface: Celebration , you didn't talk about that . project manager: I think the celebration is the twenty five pounds . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Either that or we'll be dancing on the desks . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Oh . marketing: Questionnaire . industrial designer: Okay . Is that it then ? project manager: Um yeah , just the last , I think . industrial designer: Awesome . project manager: {vocalsound} I think I've got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy . marketing: Questionnaire done . Oh , I didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time . industrial designer: Was that not the questionnaire for the {disfmarker} how you felt you'd done in your thing ? marketing: Oh , right . industrial designer: I don't think . marketing: But do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too ? industrial designer: Yeah , the the s marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: yeah . I think {disfmarker} yeah , questionnaire seven was the one I did just before the meeting . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Mm . project manager: I just got con
