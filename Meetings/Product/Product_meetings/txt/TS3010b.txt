project manager: Okay . So welcome back . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: What do {gap} {disfmarker} do we have to do ? {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} . project manager: So first . I want to say I'm the secretary , so I make the minutes . You find them in your {disfmarker} in the map in the From the group . There's the minutes from the first meeting . You'll find the next minutes also there . Then {vocalsound} I wanna hear from you , what you've done . And after that I have some new product requirements . So {disfmarker} And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do . And then we're ready . We have forty minutes for this meeting . After that we'll have lunch . So first I wanna ask the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer to tell what he did . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: That's my task . Okay . Uh I've {disfmarker} Where have I put it ? My Documents or not ? Hmm . I've save it on my computer , my presentation . project manager: Yeah on your computer , or the {disfmarker} industrial designer: But where ? project manager: What's the name ? industrial designer: Uh uh uh {disfmarker} project manager: What's the name of it ? industrial designer: It was about the working of the remote control . project manager: It's the technical function or the functional requirements . industrial designer: Nope . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Not a {gap} of {disfmarker} Wait . The working design . But I've saved it . project manager: Working design . industrial designer: But now I don't know where it is . Hmm . project manager: Working design . What is this ? Product documents . industrial designer: Yeah . And I import this until {disfmarker} project manager: On the desktop . Up . {gap} up . Up . Up . industrial designer: One more . project manager: Up . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Yes . My Documents . Nope . industrial designer: What the fuck is this ? project manager: Gone . {vocalsound} Well you {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Nah . Nah , nah , nah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: PowerPoint . Working design . industrial designer: Yeah that's the empty one . project manager: {vocalsound} And {disfmarker} industrial designer: I had one . project manager: Presentation of working design . industrial designer: Uh-huh . Open it . Okay here it is . project manager: Save as {gap} . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh it's {disfmarker} marketing: Desktop . project manager: Project {gap} . industrial designer: Project . marketing: Yeah . Okay . Well . project manager: Save . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Very good . industrial designer: A little later but here it is . marketing: {gap} project manager: Okay . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So okay . It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . It's about the working of the remote control . I just had an half an hour j to study it user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: and {vocalsound} I don't get it . marketing: {vocalsound} Make it . project manager: Now have ten minutes to tell it . industrial designer: Ten minutes to tell it . Okay . I think it will be a few minutes and {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . industrial designer: First uh I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . The working bout it {disfmarker} uh of it . Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control . With a little bit of science , uh you {disfmarker} I will show that uh in in a few minutes . And then uh what I'll think about it . First , the findings . The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside . Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it , marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: um because its uh not so expensive . And there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that . There's a lot of small uh electronics . So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it . Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it . Now {gap} {disfmarker} And here I have the top of the remote control . Uh here's some kind of chip . Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . Uh you have all on your remote control . And uh the teletext uh button . And uh here's the battery . And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . That's what I said , it's very difficult . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: And after that it will be sent to the infrared . And that will send it to your television . That's a short h uh how it works . Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult , but we all {vocalsound} we all don't get it . My preferences ? It's uh {disfmarker} it won't be uh {disfmarker} We shouldn't make it too big . Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . A long-lasting battery . Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . Not other materials . Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it . We can also make uh a button uh with a {gap} {disfmarker} menu uh button . And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: That's {disfmarker} I think it's easier . And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep . Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . And also the bleep , when {disfmarker} what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it . This is uh just uh {disfmarker} project manager: Oh oh . Two questions . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: The battery . You say one battery is cheaper . Why ? industrial designer: If we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two . project manager: Yeah but when you use two , you can use it two times longer . industrial designer: Yeah but then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting . project manager: Okay so it's the size of the remote control . industrial designer: {gap} Just {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: Okay and the buttons . When you use it on the television , you've {disfmarker} you need the television , wh which can use it . industrial designer: Yeah . But uh I think this {disfmarker} our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company ? project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Or is it also for other company {disfmarker} uh for other televisions ? project manager: I think we have to use it also on other televisions though . industrial designer: Then this is an option . {vocalsound} project manager: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions . And then we make it easier uh for our televisions . And on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , but then we won't use the project manager: Yeah but I don't {disfmarker} I think it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} They are two different things though . We have to choose one . It has to work on o uh all televisions . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Yeah ? Okay . Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions . And we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions . marketing: Hmm . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: And I just uh have one more idea . Uh maybe it's one of your tasks . But {disfmarker} Uh , to have a trendy remote control , we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones . To change covers . So if you have uh a trendy half with all red , uh yellow and something . And then you can put a red cover on it . marketing: Hmm . industrial designer: And also different things . project manager: Yeah . Good idea . industrial designer: Yes . marketing: Will this will this add to the cost ? industrial designer: Uh then it won't be {disfmarker} uh will have just one cover on the uh original one . And then you can buy the covers . marketing: Yes but you have to m uh be able to change it . D does it make it more difficult to design ? industrial designer: I think it will be a little more difficult , but not too much . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Not much . 'Kay . industrial designer: Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones . project manager: Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones . industrial designer: Just one . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it , and see if it works . If it won't works then we'll get something else . Then we uh won't g uh go further with it . project manager: Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost ? industrial designer: Uh a p a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a cover made in uh in China , it it won't be I guess so expensive I think . project manager: Yeah but there are also design cost . I don't think {disfmarker} When you have a remote control , do you change the cover ? Would you change the cover ? industrial designer: Maybe . I wi I won't . project manager: No . industrial designer: But maybe I think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it , and uh the the children think , oh this is my remote control , uh I made a picture on it . Uh {disfmarker} project manager: N yeah but {disfmarker} I think that too less people would change it for good profit . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . Okay . And the other people ? What do you think about it ? {vocalsound} marketing: Um {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah it's a good idea . But {disfmarker} If if it {disfmarker} Yeah , I don't {disfmarker} I'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . project manager: {gap} user interface: But it's uh yeah it's uh original idea . {vocalsound} project manager: Yes it is but I don't think we have to do it . user interface: No . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: You're the Project Manager . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yes . That's it . project manager: That's clear . {vocalsound} Okay thank you . So now the User Interface Designer . user interface: Oh . That's me . Uh {disfmarker} Come on . {gap} . Ah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh {disfmarker} for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set . Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way . No cords attached . And uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote . That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting . Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web . Uh well the same idea here . Uh message to the television . And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh {disfmarker} and maybe uh teletext or something like that . Uh well these are two uh remotes , and that's our uh our dilemma I think . Uh {disfmarker} We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is . But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more . Or uh uh more functions on the remote . Uh maybe more devices you can influence . Uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh V_C_R_ . {vocalsound} Yeah well that's our dilemma . Um any ideas about that ? Basic or multifunctional ? project manager: We'll got back on that later . user interface: Okay yeah . Yeah well the {disfmarker} that was just on my mind . marketing: Yes . user interface: So uh I didn't know what uh what way we would go . Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk {vocalsound} . industrial designer: 'Kay . project manager: 'Kay , thank you . Then it's your turn , the marketing expert . marketing: Okay . Uh um m Yeah . {vocalsound} Um yeah okay . This bit too far . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: So {disfmarker} So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market , about um yeah what people think . Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . And we looked at uh several um things . Uh among them design , uh d d how d did they like the use of it , uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls . Uh well what what will be our market . And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features . If um that would be a good idea or not . Well our findings . Uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls . Um uh they especially found found them very ugly . And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . Uh well they also zap a lot . So uh zapping uh should be very easy . And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . So a lot of unused buttons . There is more findings . Uh on the buttons . Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? And how much would they use them ? Well uh the most used button is the channel selection . And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important . Uh not important they found the audio , uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right . Uh the screen and the brightness . And uh channel settings . Uh th and they also are not used very often . Then we have a few um graphs about the market . Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups . Um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I don't think uh , I {vocalsound} I think the younger will be most interest in it . But uh they are not a very big group . Um in the {gap} we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature . If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control , what would you think of it . Now you can clearly see young users say {gap} . I will {disfmarker} that would very nice . And older user think uh they will be scared of change {vocalsound} I think . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: And they won't like it . And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it . Well here we see the same . Young users uh think that's an interesting idea . And old users not . Uh well we uh found out that there are two {disfmarker} several markets at which we can aim . Uh the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five . Uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here . And um they are more critical on their money spending . Uh the second group is the older group . Aged between forty six and sixty five . They are less interested in uh new features . But uh they spend their money more easily . Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . And the second group about forty percent . So the the first group is bigger . Well then I come to my uh personal preferences . Uh yeah the first question is uh {disfmarker} also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at . Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it . But less of them will buy it . Um well I uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . What I thought , um even young people say it's hard to use , remote control . So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested . And um we can make special features . But uh I think it looks nice in the first time . But when use it , uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Um well th uh that's my second point . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control . It's about discussion we had earlier . Um {disfmarker} You can find most functions on a T_V_ set . So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness . And such things . Um well the design is very important . One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one . But they found most remote controls very ugly . So the design of our remote control is very important . And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that . That were my findings . project manager: Okay thank you . industrial designer: Yeah . I have uh one question . project manager: Yes . industrial designer: If we aim for the younger people , um and there will be uh a lot of features like L_C_D_ or the the the speech uh f recognising , uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Uh I think we don't have that in our budget . marketing: Yes . user interface: No . industrial designer: Do you think ? marketing: No . user interface: And I don't uh I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something . industrial designer: Like {disfmarker} No . No . user interface: So it's {disfmarker} Yeah , it's hard to uh get the younger group . industrial designer: Uh-huh . project manager: I think uh the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition . So I think that can be an d good option . L_C_D_ . user interface: Mm-hmm . Just the L_C_D_ ? project manager: Yes . Only the L_C_D_ . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: So {disfmarker} But we'll come back on that . marketing: Okay . project manager: Now {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh , go on . What d d d um {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Uh we go {gap} {disfmarker} back on the decisions later . Now we have a few new product requirements . First , teletext . We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . So not necessary . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Next . Only for the television . So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . Only the television . We look at the age group of forty plus . Uh no , younger than forty . Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff . Fourth point . {vocalsound} Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . Very important for the design . So you can see it on our site . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Next . Um no . We have to make our decisions , what we want to do . So {vocalsound} like you said , we need the {disfmarker} {gap} . Maybe it's good to put it in a document . Now we have to decide what controls do we need . So maybe you can tell us . marketing: Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said . project manager: Sorry ? marketing: The the requirements you just said , project manager: Yes . marketing: maybe we should first have a discussion about that . project manager: Yes , it's okay . marketing: I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news . project manager: Yeah but we don't use it . It's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} new requirement . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: So , it's not my requirement . industrial designer: 'Kay , we'll just have to do that . project manager: We have to do this . industrial designer: Okay . No discussion about it . marketing: Okay . Okay sorry . project manager: No . marketing: Then uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay . {vocalsound} Unfortunately . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: So what controls do we need ? Who first ? user interface: Well a power button ? marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . Uh power . user interface: Uh the well um I think separate channels . So {disfmarker} project manager: Uh mm channel . user interface: But then both the the separate channels . So so uh zero to nine or something . project manager: Channel {disfmarker} Zero to nine . user interface: Uh volume . project manager: Volume . Maybe it's easy to pick . What was w your one ? Techno marketing: Mine ? It's the functional requirements . project manager: Okay . We had w uh no no no no . Where was that example of the {disfmarker} user interface: Oh mine . project manager: Johan . That was the {disfmarker} the the the the {disfmarker} {gap} user interface: Technical . project manager: technical {disfmarker} Hallo . Okay . What do we need ? On-off . Zero to nine . industrial designer: To change to the next channel , just one button . To move up , move down . project manager: Yeah that's the channel . marketing: D Yeah . Do we make a menu ? project manager: Menu ? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus . Uh {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} project manager: {gap} {disfmarker} M Menu . I think um the only one or two numbers . user interface: Mm yes . project manager: And {disfmarker} Hello ? That's ch {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . Up-down for channel selection , project manager: Yes . marketing: and left-right uh for volume . And uh a menu uh button . And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . But the {disfmarker} then to scroll through the menu and to change the options . project manager: On the L_C_D_ screen , you mean ? marketing: Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control . project manager: Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions . So marketing: Yes . project manager: we need {disfmarker} industrial designer: But then we come to the costs . project manager: N Yes . But if we have this {disfmarker} marketing: 'Kay . But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control . And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell . project manager: So now we don't have a lot of buttons . Is this enough ? user interface: Mute . project manager: Mute . Maybe in the menu ? user interface: Um {disfmarker} marketing: Mm . user interface: Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh thing to do . project manager: Mute . Mm-hmm . Okay . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Maybe more ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No . Well . Then that's all . This will be the buttons . And {disfmarker} I think that's enough for the next phase . So we can go on to {disfmarker} industrial designer: But now we have only the buttons . project manager: Yes . industrial designer: And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or {disfmarker} project manager: No that's for the next phase . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Um {gap} {disfmarker} Phase two is the conceptual design . So then we'll have the concepts . industrial designer: Okay . Okay . project manager: That's for the {disfmarker} So uh next point . Now we have lunch-break . After that we have t thirty minutes for work . And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons . No . Your individual action , you can find them in the email . So now it's time for lunch . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Okay . Good idea . project manager: Thanks for coming . industrial designer: {vocalsound}
