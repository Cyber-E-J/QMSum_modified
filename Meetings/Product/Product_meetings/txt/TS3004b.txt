project manager: {vocalsound} I just forgot their name , so uh you're i sorry , I just forgot them all . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I have to write it down . marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: So {disfmarker} marketing: Fine . project manager: Do you know them or {disfmarker} marketing: The names ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: For for for my sur um project manager: Yeah . marketing: Jens . project manager: Yeah , no , but your b your surname . marketing: Uh Damman . D_ A_ W_ . project manager: W_O_ da . Okay . marketing: Uh uh M_ M_ . I mean M_ . Double M_ . project manager: Okay . And what's your name ? user interface: Paul Wiezer . Paul Wiezer . project manager: W_I_E_S_ z Z_ or S_ ? user interface: A_ E_ Z_ zee zee project manager: Uh uh zee {gap} . Okay . user interface: E_ R_ . project manager: What's your name ? industrial designer: Uh Martijn . project manager: Yeah , but your surname . {vocalsound} Your surname . industrial designer: What ? Uh Abbing . A_ B_ B_ I_ N_ G_ . project manager: Okay , thanks . user interface: Uh . industrial designer: I was a little short on time , project manager: Yeah , me too , so that's not {disfmarker} industrial designer: but {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , same here . project manager: No no no , I just fi first my {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Oh . {vocalsound} Sorry . user interface: Uh let's see . Which one was mine ? project manager: So let's have a look , we have forty minutes , so it's it's more than enough . {gap} Okay , perfect . So we have {disfmarker} Oh no , what's that ? So so we have uh forty minutes for this uh for this second meeting , and we have to make uh sure that we going t that we are sure , that we are , user interface: Good . project manager: that we know what we're going to make uh th what the product is going to like {disfmarker} look like . Uh first I have the notes of the last meeting , so I showed uh show them to you . Oh , sorry about that , I just escape this one . How do I escape this ? How do I I escape this s uh presentation ? industrial designer: What ? user interface: Uh left . industrial designer: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Ah okay . user interface: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Just {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: And show , sorry . Okay , so let's have a look s at this one . Okay , so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um {disfmarker} Should be a univ uh universal remote control {disfmarker} No , that's {disfmarker} I uh s I just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a T_V_ remote control only . So have you changed that part ? marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . marketing: Okay . {vocalsound} project manager: Um so {disfmarker} yeah , it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly . It's it's still the same . Um {disfmarker} All these points uh we have to look at . You all know them . But uh there's another point . The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people . So they're old and not younger people . So we have to look at that as well . 'Specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something , I dunno . user interface: Yeah , okay . project manager: Uh so {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} yeah , that's it , so just you can do your presentation for uh {disfmarker} user interface: Which one first ? marketing: Okay . project manager: Oh it doesn't matter , just start with the {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . marketing: Mm . Uh {disfmarker} user interface: Functional requirements , yeah marketing: Okay . Well my name is Jens Damman , but we're in a group , and I I will start it . Wait . Um I've used a marketing report on uh the site . Uh I think you've uh read it too . Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site . project manager: I I didn't read i read it , so it's not for me , marketing: You didn't read it ? project manager: I didn't get it uh anyway . user interface: No , I didn don't thing we got it . project manager: It's only for you . marketing: Oh okay , I I was the only one who get it . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yes . marketing: Okay it was uh uh uh um um {vocalsound} a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users . And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof . So I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings . So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control . Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly . Yeah , I think uh uh that's a lot , so we have to make a beautiful remote control . Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy . I think this fits uh at the {vocalsound} uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people . Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good . Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at . Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot . Well okay , that's uh normal . I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons . But that's one of our requirements . project manager: The last point is quite an interesting {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Yes , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . project manager: So marketing: Um Martijn alr already said it . project manager: if we {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one , but {disfmarker} I don't think it's uh project manager: Yeah , we should have the ten percent on the on the top , marketing: reachable . project manager: then you're you're {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: That that's a good one . Um uh page two . Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something . Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , so when you {vocalsound} clap your hands it will beep or something . Uh you must find it uh quickly . user interface: Uh . Maybe just a button on the home station . So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station . marketing: Okay , yeah . Yeah , we can uh combine that . Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control . Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this . It's only uh th thirty four of the {vocalsound} thirty four percent . But it's uh a tough one . Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty I think . Uh next , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . Yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something . I don't {disfmarker} We we haven't {disfmarker} Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point . Okay , last page . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition . We didn't uh think about that already . And uh an L_C_D_ on the remote control . We already thought about that . Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features . And but they're more critical . And older people uh want to spend uh more money . {vocalsound} But uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features , because they're in their old uh thinking way . And they want to keep the old uh things the old things . {gap} project manager: So we have uh a new uh age of forty plus . marketing: But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ? project manager: People . So yeah , so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control , marketing: I I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly , user interface: Yeah . project manager: because {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros . project manager: It's too {disfmarker} Okay . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Um then {disfmarker} I have my personal uh preference . Okay , that's {vocalsound} not very good , because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ . I had a question about . But it's already out of the question , this . Um my point is , well , I {vocalsound} {disfmarker} If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros . But it's the exercise . project manager: Because it's too expensive . Yeah , probably . marketing: Yeah , only only for television uh {disfmarker} On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything . And we only make it for television , so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special . user interface: Yeah , but good usability , so you can use it . marketing: Okay , I told about the home station . Uh it must be simple , because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it . And I I found a motto . And we put the fashion in electronics . And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style . We we have to make a {vocalsound} a new product . We have to be um {disfmarker} Yeah . One of a kind , I think . project manager: So it has to look uh uh uh unique , user interface: Unique . marketing: {vocalsound} The company is about our uh th th their own fashion , their own style . project manager: but {disfmarker} Yeah . user interface: Yeah , I reckon {disfmarker} project manager: But old people are not looking for that . user interface: Uh I think mm {disfmarker} project manager: Not really . user interface: Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . I think the main thing is the usability , that's where we can uh make it a special product . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , project manager: Okay . Yeah . marketing: to k to keep it simple when you {disfmarker} user interface: But uh we also have to stand out , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Sorry I thought about it , yes . user interface: 'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff . But we have to make sure that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it . So make it just a different colour or different shape , project manager: Yeah . Okay . user interface: so {disfmarker} marketing: Okay , this was uh my presentation . project manager: Thanks . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: I don't {disfmarker} project manager: So marketing: Yeah . project manager: Paul , you can do the next one if you want . marketing: You can ask some questions or something . user interface: Okay . Yeah well {disfmarker} Uh . project manager: It's on the on the uh net net uh thing , user interface: There it is . project manager: isn't it ? user interface: Okay . Technical functions design . Okay , well , so we have s mm uh broad audience . Isn't {disfmarker} that isn't true anymore . But um we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple . Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls . Not too full , like uh Jens already said , only ten percent is being used . project manager: So what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , I have it on the next page . project manager: Okay . user interface: But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff . Um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons . Uh an icon on it or text on it , so it's very clear what that buttons does . So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it . Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control project manager: Yeah . user interface: to find out . But there is already in a one done . Of functions I could think of . Uh volume , channels , the the basic according to {gap} . Just one two three etcetera . Uh text service options . Um basic on-off . And I found an uh {disfmarker} Could I think of favourites ? I always look up the same um pages on text and always have to click the number . project manager: Okay . user interface: But if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on your {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . So you might as well remember the number . Or not ? project manager: Maybe i maybe it's too complicated , user interface: No y project manager: but not sure {gap} . user interface: Well project manager: It's a good idea , but {disfmarker} user interface: it's {disfmarker} It was just a thought . So I'm , I u {disfmarker} I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six . industrial designer: Yeah , okay . But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ? user interface: Well uh project manager: Uh {gap} {disfmarker} user interface: what I was reading on the page . Uh a remote control just sends commands , basics commands to uh the television . So switch to channel six . industrial designer: Yeah ? user interface: So uh button six says says six . And if you make favourites , it can say six six six in a row . Just numbers . That can be in the in the {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah okay . But uh uh for a user to to remember , if I press that button it goes to that channel . user interface: Well if you said a favourite {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , but isn't it hard to remember ? Like favourite one and {disfmarker} project manager: Uh mayb for me it's {disfmarker} user interface: Well i project manager: If I use my telephone , I never use those buttons to to to call sh Never . user interface: Never ? Oh . industrial designer: No , neither do I . project manager: So {disfmarker} user interface: Oh are you ? project manager: And {disfmarker} user interface: Okay now , m maybe not . project manager: If I don't do it , maybe old people {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: No , maybe elderly people uh . Right . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno . user interface: They don't like new features . So maybe not . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Um well play , pause . I dunno if that's usable project manager: It's not , it's still not {disfmarker} It's not anymore n uh {disfmarker} user interface: when {disfmarker} Not anymore for T_V_ . project manager: {gap} user interface: Right , on off . {vocalsound} I dunno , miss {disfmarker} Did I miss any other buttons , basic buttons ? I couldn't think of any other , 'specially not for T_V_ . marketing: Um {disfmarker} project manager: Just on the front as well . No , that's the only th the only thing you need . user interface: Is {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh uh the p uh next and previous . Previous I know , but next channel ? user interface: Just the channel um uh {disfmarker} What I mean is uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: I don't thi marketing: Forward . industrial designer: Li like a web browser , user interface: Six seven eight or five . industrial designer: so {disfmarker} Oh , okay . project manager: Just very simple . industrial designer: But uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before . Like a web browser back button . user interface: Um I dunno . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} Yeah , user interface: I don't have {disfmarker} Uh I did {disfmarker} project manager: I know what it is , but I think it's all too difficult for old people . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , marketing: No . Uh {disfmarker} user interface: I don't think you use that . Y only when you want to go to {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , okay . user interface: Yeah , just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time . project manager: And how do you want to uh do it , like if you have a channel above ten ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Normally you can press one , zero or {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons . So you have that uh {disfmarker} project manager: A ten plus or {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , the ten plus button . Just uh one one pressing , or quickly after each other . project manager: Okay . user interface: To just keep it simple and standard uh features . industrial designer: Yeah , w wouldn't it be a problem to uh {disfmarker} Because you h have to be fast enough . Maybe the elderly people {disfmarker} user interface: Uh yeah mayb marketing: It gets some seconds . user interface: But I think that's in the T_V_ as well . That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it . But you can have a button that says um two two st two stripes . industrial designer: Oh okay . Yeah . marketing: Yeah , it's it's no it's not a {disfmarker} user interface: So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons . industrial designer: Yeah , but that's th mm {disfmarker} marketing: It's what Paul says . It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the T_V_ um do one two . It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: So if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: So we have a a period of , I dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that {disfmarker} And not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: But do we still need a two level remote control ? Because if we only have that l only f marketing: It's only for television now . user interface: So I I don't think so . project manager: No . user interface: Uh I just thought of another one . marketing: No . user interface: Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu . project manager: Yeah . user interface: So you also need a menu button . And then uh navigation uh {disfmarker} But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: so you have industrial designer: I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things , and uh the menu button . user interface: four arrows . industrial designer: Because you n almost never use menu button . user interface: Yeah , okay , industrial designer: So {disfmarker} user interface: but um {disfmarker} project manager: Maybe it's still still a good idea , I'm not sure . You'll also have to use a mute button to to {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , a mute button . Yes . project manager: Maybe , not {disfmarker} user interface: Don't think so . project manager: I don't know where where you have to put it . user interface: Yeah well , marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: that's that's {disfmarker} I think that's the layers that produce . Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on . What we're gonna use . project manager: Okay . Yeah . Yeah . That's right . user interface: And later we can d uh do the design . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Okay , uh now my personal preferences . Uh using the standards , basic {disfmarker} Um I think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design . So we have to , I dunno , uh make a different shape than usual . So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging , that it stands out . Not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls . project manager: Yeah . Does it have to be {disfmarker} Uh it has to be uh with different colours user interface: Um {disfmarker} I dunno . Different colours um {disfmarker} project manager: or {disfmarker} marketing: Maybe we can give it out in different colours . You can choose blue or yellow project manager: It's like a iMac or something . marketing: or {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Just to make it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . Well why not ? Or {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: That's fa That's fancy . That's uh fashion . project manager: But it looks cheap as well , because it's a small thing . It's only twenty five Euros . It looks very cheap if you make it {disfmarker} user interface: Well , maybe you can look at uh mobile phones . project manager: Oh , you just {disfmarker} I dunno what happened . user interface: Oh . marketing: {gap} user interface: Who ? project manager: Yeah , we have to look at mobile phones , that's right . Just {disfmarker} user interface: They they're uh designed very well . project manager: Yeah . user interface: And well basically are the same , just a bit smaller . You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it . project manager: Yeah . user interface: But uh well , I think that's a good example . project manager: Okay , {gap} marketing: Okay . project manager: we hurry up a bit , because otherwise we won't make it . user interface: Okay , sorry . project manager: Is it fin Are you finished ? user interface: Well uh {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah , I I'm finished . I think we discussed everything . industrial designer: Okay . Well , the working design . The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided . Um {disfmarker} Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh I could figure it out . Um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch . And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . So like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh {disfmarker} Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code to uh {disfmarker} And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . That's the uh light emitting diode , I think . Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . That's un uh invisible to the human eye . And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ . However it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's uh blinking red if you look in it . And that's uh another diode , I believe . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Because infrared is not visible . So that's er uh do two different things project manager: So we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ? industrial designer: but {disfmarker} Yeah . I I think so . {vocalsound} user interface: Uh j Is {disfmarker} industrial designer: I I'm not sure if it's the same thing . project manager: Yeah , it's {disfmarker} I think it's usable . user interface: Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ? marketing: Yeah , that's active . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Or just a green one , user interface: So {disfmarker} project manager: because it's {disfmarker} If you use it , it's green or the red , it's r green . user interface: Yeah . Maybe uh {disfmarker} marketing: I I think it's in the case that it's active . It's not uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , that's right . industrial designer: Yeah , when you press it . project manager: But if you {disfmarker} industrial designer: So {disfmarker} marketing: I it's it's just uh the the {disfmarker} project manager: Red's l shows up like something's wrong , industrial designer: Two ? project manager: and green is like it's okay , you press the button . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno . user interface: Maybe depends on uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Ma on on most on most uh uh remote controls it's red . project manager: Yeah , I know . user interface: Yes . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay , we make it red . user interface: But maybe {disfmarker} industrial designer: So user interface: Well industrial designer: I know . user interface: we don't have to make it red . Maybe integrate it in the design as well . project manager: You have to {disfmarker} The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons . Uh that's cool . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} I I think uh the batteries will be uh {vocalsound} a little {disfmarker} user interface: Uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Oh , marketing: {vocalsound} Empty . user interface: maybe it's it is would an e No . Just uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: No , we have a recharger in it , so {disfmarker} user interface: Oh . industrial designer: Yeah , okay . project manager: If we can still make that then {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh maybe . user interface: Yeah , but it doesn't have to be red . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: It's just to indicate something's on . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . That it's working . That it's not not the batteries are low . project manager: But it's cool if it was green . user interface: Yeah . It's it's not very important , project manager: Green or red or whatever , it is cool . {vocalsound} user interface: so yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , I know . Just to indicate it's working . user interface: So mm {disfmarker} industrial designer: And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern . So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . So that it can be used with all the T_V_s . We have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o On the {disfmarker} Otherwise it won't work . user interface: So we have to uh make buttons for that as well , to make it uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: No . I I uh {disfmarker} The chip um uh is producing the pattern . So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: An automatically search function for each television , or something . industrial designer: That are working . Yeah , or {disfmarker} I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works . It wasn't explained there . user interface: Well , I I use a universal uh remote control , marketing: Uh I kno user interface: and {gap} list of all the T_V_s you have , etcetera . And you have to put in a number , so it works on your T_V_ . industrial designer: Yeah ? Okay . marketing: Oh , I have a modern one . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: And the modern one you you uh you type uh search , and the LED began to blink blink blink . And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off . And then you know , oh it it's the right one . And you can stop it , industrial designer: Ah okay . marketing: and then it's okay . So you don't have to search for your television or your code . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: It uh search uh the pattern for itself . user interface: Okay , industrial designer: Okay , yeah . user interface: so we use that . industrial designer: So it uh {disfmarker} We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . Because you have to {disfmarker} marketing: Yes . user interface: Yep . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: I just say {disfmarker} Can you s just say it again , because I was just looking {disfmarker} There's just a short {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh okay . Well uh y you have this chip . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: That's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different . So like when you press a one on one T_V_ it go go to one . And on the other T_V_ it won't work , basically . So uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: And uh by d uh that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time . marketing: Changing the signal . industrial designer: And um {disfmarker} What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television . And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , so {disfmarker} And then he saves that setting project manager: Okay . Yeah . industrial designer: and then um it's working . marketing: Yeah , that's the right uh option . industrial designer: Okay . Well uh the components . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , that's a bit technical , and I hadn't {disfmarker} I w I was a little short on time . Um but I think I understand it . Um the energy source is uh the battery , basically . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Um that's connecting to all the components . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Because it has to be fed with energy . Okay . Uh the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed . So basically when you press a button , a switch get closed . Um that's connecting to a chip . So the chip knows what button you pressed . And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb . I didn didn't put the description by this one . Th this is a normal bulb . So the normal flashing light . project manager: Okay . So that's the LED , L_E_D_ . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah , and this is a LED too . marketing: {gap} industrial designer: But this one is producing infrared light project manager: Yeah , okay . industrial designer: that's invisible . And this one is producing normal light . project manager: So we can make the normal one also a normal light . Not a LED light , but as a normal one . To flash up your {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah {disfmarker} marketing: Uh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works . But one you can't see and one indicates that you use a button . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , presu Yeah yeah yeah . Because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work , it can {disfmarker} Basically if the battery is low , it won't work . marketing: Yeah . Yeah , and {disfmarker} project manager: Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push . So you see green if you push that button . industrial designer: Huh , that's a good idea . marketing: Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then . project manager: Yeah , but if you u if you do that , you know that you're uh sending a signal . user interface: No , y Yeah . marketing: Okay . project manager: And it's {disfmarker} you also know which button you p marketing: But then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be LEDs . project manager: Yeah , that's right . But it {disfmarker} marketing: Everywhere in the r project manager: But does it make any difference for the energy you use ? You got still one LED . user interface: No I don't think so , but {disfmarker} Yeah , i it it will look different , and I think we need to find something else . project manager: That looks different , yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: 'Cause otherwise we will just make another standard , and our uh motto also is {disfmarker} marketing: Is LEDs uh beneath the the buttons ? user interface: Yeah , w around the buttons , or in the buttons even . marketing: Yeah , okay . industrial designer: Yeah , but mm like when you push it user interface: {gap} Yeah , then then won't {disfmarker} Then you won't see it . industrial designer: n n Yeah . You have your finger over the button . So you can see {disfmarker} marketing: It must be around it then . industrial designer: Yeah . Or or m maybe on top of the {disfmarker} A green light is flashing marketing: Yeah , then {disfmarker} industrial designer: or {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . Not not not not here , but here . industrial designer: Yeah . There . Yeah . marketing: Maybe uh {disfmarker} project manager: The same as a telephone , or a mobile phone , or what do you mean ? user interface: {gap} Yeah , we're thinking about it . project manager: If you push {disfmarker} user interface: Uh on a mobile phone , in the dark uh project manager: It lights up . Everything lights up . That's a good idea . user interface: everything lights up . Why ain't that on a remote control ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: It it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much . user interface: Yeah , if uh a mobile phone a phone can do it , it's {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . project manager: It's f Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Maybe that's a good idea for old people as well . user interface: Yeah , i if you're in the dark , you can't see the remote . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: It's only few LEDs . Only four or something . Four LED . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: No , I dunno . But if we use a battery station , which I think we will use {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , project manager: Yeah , that's a good idea , okay . marketing: I uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . We'll have enough power project manager: Everything agre industrial designer: to {disfmarker} project manager: Everyone agrees with that , or {disfmarker} Okay . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yep . marketing: Maybe what Paul said , uh under the {disfmarker} on the on the home station , uh a button to uh to call your uh remote control , that it beeps . project manager: Yeah , and then you {disfmarker} Okay , yeah . But you have to make a sound device in it then . user interface: And also it's {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , there must be sound in it . project manager: But {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Okay , it shouldn't take much {disfmarker} marketing: I dunno . industrial designer: Yeah . B maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make . Especially for that kind of money . Because it's i it has to be {disfmarker} marketing: Mm uh , twenty five Euros , I think we can make it . user interface: Uh I th industrial designer: Yeah . Production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half . marketing: Bec Twelve and a half , okay . But but we only have to make it for television , and um we must have something special . industrial designer: Yeah , okay . user interface: I think uh you also have uh {vocalsound} remote controls with a lot of options . marketing: So {disfmarker} user interface: But we lose about ninety percent of those options . So I think you can uh {disfmarker} marketing: Uh . We have to give our customers some extras . user interface: Yeah . I think we will save money with that . industrial designer: Yeah , okay . project manager: Okay . Are you almost finished or just {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , the the personal preference , I didn't fill it out . project manager: Okay . Okay . industrial designer: Because I was short on time . project manager: No worry . industrial designer: But um {disfmarker} Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration . project manager: Yeah , I just want to talk some {disfmarker} about some more . So maybe you have to {disfmarker} Yeah ? industrial designer: Yeah ? project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: So this {disfmarker} Oh , sorry . Wh what's that ? So uh {disfmarker} Oh , sorry . We have some new uh project requirements . We have to have a look what they are . They're still in um {disfmarker} Uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet . So a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one . I'm not sure . I don't think so , industrial designer: No , project manager: but {disfmarker} industrial designer: and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use . marketing: No . project manager: Yeah , and it's it's on your comp it's on your television . It's only one button . So I don't think it is {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Uh . project manager: We definitely should use it . Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: Yeah , that's uh what I told you . The remote control should only be used for a television . So that's maybe easier . And um the the forty plus people , I already told you . Oh no , sorry . Oh , this is a problem . Oh sorry about that . The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . So it should be flashy or just more interesting . marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: Oh . Mm . user interface: Okay , that's {disfmarker} It changes things . project manager: I'm sorry about that . I just I just didn't read it well . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: So does it make some decision about that ? {vocalsound} marketing: Changes . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: That kinda changes the whole situation . marketing: Uh {disfmarker} user interface: Well yeah , then we have to make some nice features . I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way , project manager: That still stays . user interface: to make it more like a mobile phone . More modern . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: That's important I think and {disfmarker} marketing: L_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think . user interface: And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control , especially when you only have T_V_ functions on it . marketing: Oh . project manager: Yeah . user interface: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm ah {disfmarker} I I don't y you'll use it often , because you can see on the television wh what channel you {disfmarker} marketing: Oh , I'm watching uh the channel one . Okay . {vocalsound} No , it's not {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable . industrial designer: {vocalsound} No . user interface: So , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah . What other features can we put in ? industrial designer: Yeah . I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular . And uh then the usability is not that required , because the {disfmarker} Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think . marketing: But uh some of you had uh something to read about um {vocalsound} uh speech uh recognition . About you said one and the television turns on one . Is that reachable maybe ? industrial designer: I didn't read {disfmarker} marketing: That's very {disfmarker} That's fancy . That's cool . user interface: It's very fashion . industrial designer: I didn't read any marketing: Twelve and you've got twelve . industrial designer: b Yeah . Yeah okay . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: I I know . marketing: Only the numbers , only numbers . Uh furthermore nothing . But only the numbers , one to twenty or something . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: That should be cool . project manager: Yeah , maybe we have to integrate that as well . If it's possible . But {disfmarker} marketing: If it's possible , industrial designer: Yeah , project manager: I don't think it's very expensive actually . industrial designer: I don't know . marketing: I dunno . I didn't read it . user interface: Mm . project manager: Why should it ? user interface: Yeah , I think it's {disfmarker} marketing: Uh if i if i project manager: You only have a microphone in it . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: I didn't have information about that . industrial designer: But it has to work . And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or {disfmarker} project manager: Nah , maybe {disfmarker} marketing: Ah that's a problem , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: And and uh w Yeah ? marketing: Uh only in English . Only in English I think . user interface: What {disfmarker} But uh I dunno how that works then . Uh does your uh {disfmarker} Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever industrial designer: Yeah , it's probably my job to figure that out , but {disfmarker} user interface: uh one to have in channel one ? marketing: No , that {disfmarker} Yeah , then th we have to think about that . But do {vocalsound} do we do it ? user interface: Yeah , marketing: It's more if we if we do it . user interface: I dunno . So , is it very usable ? That's what I'm looking at . industrial designer: And and do you have to speak in in like in a thing marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: or {disfmarker} project manager: Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that . user interface: Is {disfmarker} project manager: It {disfmarker} We have short time to to put it on the market , industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno . project manager: so that {disfmarker} We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that . user interface: Mm {disfmarker} Yeah well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah , I think so . {gap} project manager: We make uh make uh , we can make th th the new remote control very flashy . {gap} marketing: Yeah , and uh and uh {disfmarker} user interface: It's {disfmarker} marketing: In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing . Uh because we we have a lot of languages . project manager: Yeah . user interface: I d Yeah . I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition . industrial designer: And and {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . I think so . industrial designer: Yeah , and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition , you can just throw the uh {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke , and the T_V_ turns uh to one . industrial designer: the remote away . Mm . Hmm . Mm . Yeah , okay . marketing: Yeah , user interface: Yeah . Well yeah , marketing: it's not uh {disfmarker} user interface: that's the right command . And then you have to say uh T_V_ channel one , or something . Not just one , industrial designer: But {disfmarker} Hmm yeah , T_V_ one . user interface: but {disfmarker} marketing: Okay , but th that becomes your f Uh uh because that's very hard for uh speech recognition . user interface: Well I dunno . But I don't think , it just ain't useful enough . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: we have to make some decisions . So marketing: Okay , no speech recognition . project manager: you can see on the uh {disfmarker} So we have to know what we're going to put on . Do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? Do {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , I think so . project manager: If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , so you can see what other but buttons there are , okay ? industrial designer: Yeah , that's good . project manager: Okay , we just take that one . user interface: Yep . project manager: And what else , we have {disfmarker} user interface: Also the one in the dark . So uh {disfmarker} It lights up when it's dark ? project manager: Yeah , but it's {disfmarker} Oh th I thought would , that that would be the same . user interface: I didn't {disfmarker} project manager: If you push something , it it all lights up . user interface: Okay . marketing: Yeah . Yeah yeah , user interface: Yeah , but um {disfmarker} marketing: it it mustn't work all the time . user interface: Yes , that's what I mean . marketing: It uh uh it have to work only when you use it . project manager: Or you can switch it on or something . marketing: So if you {disfmarker} user interface: Or maybe when you {disfmarker} marketing: No , if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off . user interface: yeah . It lights up all . project manager: Yeah , that's right . You have to {disfmarker} Yeah , that's right . That's what I said . It's the same as the telephone . Yeah . user interface: Okay yeah . D Yeah , alright . Yeah . project manager: And do we use a a {disfmarker} Uh what's it called ? Like a iMac , {gap} if you can look through it . Or just a normal remote control . user interface: Maybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like iPod . industrial designer: Mm , maybe it's a good idea . user interface: Different colours , uh maybe use even different fonts . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Like uh phones . marketing: Oh yeah . project manager: Different colours . Okay , industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: so y you just make it th through {disfmarker} You look through it ? marketing: A see-through . Mm , that's cool . user interface: Yeah . Uh as an option maybe . project manager: Okay . And so the buttons we have , this is , yeah , this is normal . We put in the the simple buttons on the top , user interface: It's the standard {disfmarker} project manager: and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there . user interface: Yeah , uh {disfmarker} Yeah , marketing: But you have {disfmarker} You had a lot of different buttons . user interface: we but we don't {disfmarker} We don't really have any complicated buttons . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: Yeah , maybe you have you have to {disfmarker} Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one . user interface: Yeah okay , but {disfmarker} Yeah , well w I think the buttons are very easy . With just uh standard buttons we just have so little {disfmarker} project manager: O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . Because you ne almost never use it . user interface: No , I don't need don't need {disfmarker} Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something . industrial designer: Yeah , but younger people I think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext . project manager: Yeah , that's right . user interface: I use teletext as well . industrial designer: So uh {disfmarker} marketing: No , I use te teletext every day , I think . industrial designer: Hmm . Okay . project manager: Yeah . For me too , it is . So we just keep it one level then ? Okay . user interface: Yeah yeah , one level . And I think , uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons , marketing: Mm . user interface: I think the design is most important . You can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: 'Cause {gap} simple buttons . project manager: Okay . user interface: If you put one above it , it's clear . project manager: Okay . So that's it for toda for {disfmarker} We're going to have a lunch lunch break . Um {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: How long is lunch break ? project manager: So yeah , you know what you have to do . This is uh this is it . You get your meal and everything , so {disfmarker} marketing: Trendwatching . Okay . That's fine . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yo . project manager: So , we're finished for t for this time . We're going to have some lunch . user interface: Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Bye . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . {gap} user interface: {gap} marketing: Mm . Uh . user interface: {gap} marketing: {gap} project manager: {gap} industrial designer: {gap} marketing: {gap} {vocalsound} {gap}
