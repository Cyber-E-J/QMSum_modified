project manager: Well hi everyone again . user interface: Hello . industrial designer: Hello . marketing: Hello project manager: Um {vocalsound} like before we uh {disfmarker} I have to redo the meetings from {vocalsound} {disfmarker} n th the minutes from the last meeting marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: and so here we go . Uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um designer {vocalsound} that uh looks would be very important on this new remote user interface: Designer . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: and um it is to send messages of course to the T_V_ . It should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . It should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings or something . Uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote . Um . {vocalsound} Should be child friendly design with few buttons , colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons . Um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Um {disfmarker} marketing: And she was challenged on that point {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} that's right . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yes . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: But uh her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . The industrial designer um presented her uh {vocalsound} thoughts on the issue . She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . Should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . Uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery . Uh and of course a circuit board . And how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse {disfmarker} morse code related relays the {disfmarker} uh to the generat to the generator amplification and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider . marketing: Okay . project manager: She would like uh {disfmarker} this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . Should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases . The marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with {disfmarker} to to to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . To do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . Too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home . Um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . She feels that's really what people want today . And the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons . And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes {disfmarker} from the last meeting . Now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Just the look like , the button part I'll explain . industrial designer: Yeah . Uh so this is our {disfmarker} what uh we have made . This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: um and it's {disfmarker} it's blue in colour uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: so it is a {disfmarker} uh uh a {disfmarker} looks-wise it is beautiful . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Uh and also compact in shape . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Uh um and also i it it will be easily fit into {disfmarker} into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily . marketing: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Good . industrial designer: Yeah , project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: oops , sorry . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} You used to have all the buttons {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Um yeah and um uh the material which we are going to use for the case is uh plastic and uh w which which is s strong um uh and also uh for the {disfmarker} Um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber um and als marketing: Oh that's good , industrial designer: yeah . marketing: no , that's nice and friendly . industrial designer: Yeah because uh uh you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it . marketing: Mm-hmm . Mm . project manager: Mm-hmm , marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: mm-hmm . industrial designer: And then um uh for the {disfmarker} for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: and it's a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: And {disfmarker} and the button {disfmarker} button's part uh will be explained by F Francina . user interface: Okay . marketing: Okay . user interface: Now the um {disfmarker} we decided upon including certain features on our remote . Now these features includes the s um signal emitting uh signal {disfmarker} it's the led or L_E_D_ the infrared . project manager: Mm-hmm , marketing: Yeah , okay , mm-hmm . project manager: mm-hmm . user interface: Now uh we have included the switch on and off button . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Now we have included another feature that is the mute button marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: on the side of the model . Then we have included one to nine buttons marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: for controlling the programmes {disfmarker} the different channels . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels . Now our {disfmarker} our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button . marketing: Mm . project manager: What kind of button ? user interface: Menu button . project manager: Menu ? Uh menu th menu , uh one one . user interface: Yes , menu {disfmarker} marketing: Menu button . {vocalsound} user interface: At the centre marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness marketing: Mm-hmm . Of the screen . Mm , mm-hmm . user interface: of this uh picture . We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button . Now this is uh a special , special feature which we have included . Now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel . It will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a swapping button . marketing: The next channel in the numeric pattern , or {disfmarker} user interface: No , swapping is if if example you're {disfmarker} you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button . marketing: Yeah , mm-hmm . Mm . user interface: Yes . marketing: Okay , okay . user interface: And at the end , it {disfmarker} this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly . project manager: Okay . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . user interface: So this is our proposed model . marketing: Okay . user interface: Now the marketing expert has to marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Tell , yeah . user interface: give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable {vocalsound} or it'll be cost effective . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Okay , well um what {disfmarker} what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb , user interface: Yes , yes . marketing: that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand , yeah ? project manager: Yes the buttons are all raised , right ? marketing: The buttons are all raised project manager: Are raised , mm-hmm . user interface: Yes . marketing: and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down , project manager: Right . Or have two hands to operate it , yeah . marketing: I really like that . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: You really did a good job on that , my little designers . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Um and um I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place . That's that's a really good good thing . project manager: Yes , and it sort of sticks up so that you really {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , that's great . project manager: you don't have to g first go like oh yeah here it's on and yeah , mm-hmm . industrial designer: Hmm . Mm-hmm . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Abs okay . marketing: The colour's very attractive . Um the um these buttons uh around here are the mute user interface: No , these {disfmarker} the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons . marketing: and {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} mm-hmm On both sides they're mute ? user interface: Yes , yes . marketing: So you can push either one ? user interface: Yes . marketing: Okay . project manager: So if you're left-handed or right-handed it doesn't matter . marketing: And this brings the menu up on the screen ? user interface: {vocalsound} Pardon me ? This is the menu {disfmarker} yes , yes . marketing: This brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are {disfmarker} user interface: A the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes , marketing: Okay . user interface: and these two are to uh scroll the programme channels . marketing: F f okay . user interface: Scroll up or scroll down the channels . marketing: Right , very good . Uh it looks mm looks like something I can sell . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay and now I'm supposed to {disfmarker} project manager: Well , I have one question marketing: yeah . project manager: uh will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ? user interface: Yes , it will have uh {disfmarker} these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols . industrial designer: Ah . Yeah , definitely . project manager: Will have symbols so that that {disfmarker} that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it {disfmarker} user interface: Yes , which can be easily recognised . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: Good point because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent . user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Yeah of course , and also {disfmarker} user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: Yeah . But anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols , text or something so that people kn industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Yeah we can {disfmarker} Text . marketing: Symbols on it . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Text that we can have on the case itself , project manager: That's right . user interface: Yes . industrial designer: we can {disfmarker} it will be printed on the case and symbols as well as the buttons . Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Okay , yeah just wanted make sure of that mm-hmm . user interface: And {disfmarker} and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape . marketing: Mm , 'kay , mm . Mm-hmm . user interface: A shell shape . marketing: For the snail , yeah , mm-hmm , project manager: Right , mm-hmm . user interface: Yes , yes . industrial designer: Yeah . So it is {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} we have the snail shell . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yes , snail shell . industrial designer: yeah , marketing: He goes right back into his shell . industrial designer: yeah {disfmarker} shell . project manager: Right . user interface: Yes . marketing: Well you know I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Mm . user interface: {vocalsound} Y Yes {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , of course , yeah . marketing: you know that would , that would really work . project manager: Now what , what are our special features for the marketing ? marketing: So {disfmarker} project manager: That's really the voice recognition that's really unusual {disfmarker} marketing: I think voice recognition is our big selling point industrial designer: Mm . Mm-hmm . marketing: 'cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range . industrial designer: Mm . project manager: And then , and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use . marketing: Yep project manager: You know . marketing: uh well I think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical . I think we have to , we have to dwell on on on the appearance . project manager: Colours . Mm-hmm . marketing: We're really gonna have the be the project manager: Cutest . marketing: cutest remote control on the block . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: So I think we have to play with the image , play with the snail image um play with the visual and then the voice recognition . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: I think those are the two things to push . The look and the voice recognition . They're gonna be our two selling points . project manager: Okay , now uh having said that {disfmarker} marketing: I'm supposed to make a little presentation , aren't I ? project manager: No , now this was our evaluation criteria which we uh just have done . marketing: Okay . project manager: Now we're gonna talk about financing . {vocalsound} marketing: Ah , but in my instructions I think it said I was supposed to go to the board and do something . project manager: {vocalsound} Well , there is a production evaluation . marketing: No ? project manager: Is that you ? marketing: Yeah , that's me . project manager: But that's after the financing . marketing: Oh , okay . project manager: See ? Fi see ? marketing: Sorry , sorry . Mm-mm . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Um . {vocalsound} Okay , we had looks and voice recognition . Okay now on the financing we bring up the mm there it is . Okay uh energy source we say that's battery , right ? industrial designer: Mm . marketing: That's right . project manager: Okay , now . So we {disfmarker} I guess we use one . user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: What ? T cell or chart you are trying to change is protected . Well , that's nice . She told me I could just ch change it here and then it would {disfmarker} It doesn't work . Hmm . marketing: Can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes ? Or {disfmarker} project manager: Oh , okay yeah , okay , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: let's see . Okay , one , okay . user interface: Yes . project manager: Oh go away . Um kinetic source so that's {disfmarker} in the energy source that's all we need . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Uh electronics , simple chip on print ? Is that's what we're using ? user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Yeah , project manager: One of those ? industrial designer: yeah . project manager: Come on . Okay , one . Uh regular chip on print . No . That's all we need , the one industrial designer: No . Yeah . project manager: {disfmarker} case , uncurved flat , single curved , double curved . marketing: Well . {vocalsound} industrial designer: This is a {disfmarker} user interface: Single curve ? Mm . marketing: I guess it's double curved . project manager: Double curved ? One of those ? marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Case materi s supplements . Plastic we said , right ? user interface: Plastic . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Uh wood , rubber ? industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Rubber , because we're gonna have the soft buttons . project manager: Uh but , yes but {disfmarker} industrial designer: I think uh that is uh f for rubbers that is uh {disfmarker} yeah case material . project manager: That's just for the case material , user interface: Is this for the case ? Yes . project manager: so special colours though , we having that , marketing: Oh okay , the mm-hmm , mm' kay . project manager: right ? user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: And then we have to interface push buttons . user interface: Yes . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Scroll wheel , no . Integrated scroll wheel , L_C_ display ? user interface: No . marketing: No , project manager: Button . marketing: 'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all , right ? project manager: No . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Uh , button supplement special colour ? user interface: Speci Yes project manager: Special form ? user interface: Yes d we do have special form . marketing: Yes . project manager: And special material , rubber , wood , yes . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Total seven point six whatever that means . industrial designer: Uh , I think that's the price . project manager: That's the price . user interface: One two three four five six seven eight nine project manager: Mm ? industrial designer: Maybe it {disfmarker} is it just {disfmarker} n project manager: Eight , eight point two . That's {disfmarker} user interface: Nine points , project manager: hmm ? user interface: okay , yes . project manager: Eight point two , right ? So , we {disfmarker} looks like we are well within budget . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Okay . I guess I should save this I suppose , huh ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: Oops . Uh-huh huh huh . user interface: On the desktop . project manager: I just tried that . My documents , computer . industrial designer: AMI . project manager: My compu Ah oh here it is , yes . industrial designer: AMI should for project manager: Okay , fine . Save . Okay good , so that's the good news . We gonna be popular . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Um . So that uh {disfmarker} I think financing was pretty simple . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation . marketing: Okay , I'll take my file down so you can bring it up . 'Kay should be able to get it now . 'Kay , why don't you move just to the next slide right away . project manager: You wanna go to the next slide ? marketing: Yeah right away . project manager: Okay . marketing: Okay , well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that {disfmarker} maybe little things we haven't thought of . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: We can't accept every suggestion of course , but maybe we just need to get a few . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: And show the the prototype to consumer research groups , we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . Mm . marketing: So we have to get some input from those people . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it , we think it's good , we're gonna get behind it and sell it . Um , next slide please . Okay , now the things that I was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . I wanted the shape to be biomorphic , I didn't want anything with angles and all square , I wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that . The size is small , the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted . We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we'll have the soft buttons industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: and the way this is shaped , even though it's gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that's nice . And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} So paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel um and the shape , that's what people are gonna get in the store . user interface: Fee selling . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: They don't have a television in the store , they can't play with it . user interface: Yes . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Um so they'll be our main selling points . So um {vocalsound} th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please . Okay , so um the shape um I think is a {disfmarker} a one . That's really , really excellent shape . The size is small um and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these aren't i in how I feel . I think that it's {disfmarker} I think that it's plenty small enough to sell but I think we're sort of right {disfmarker} the scale is one to seven . I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors . user interface: Okay . marketing: And our colour I think is great . The colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . And given um the constraints that we had I think we got it as soft as possible . And then functionality um I think you did a really good job on functionality , obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it . project manager: Um I just realised one thing . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser . marketing: Yes . user interface: Yes . marketing: Ah . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: And uh I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too . marketing: Well , um we had what , eight eight euros twenty as our cost ? project manager: Eight , eight twenty , yes . industrial designer: Eight twenty so {disfmarker} marketing: And so we've got {disfmarker} we've still got four euros to go {disfmarker} to spend . industrial designer: We have um four euros , yeah project manager: I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean {vocalsound} four thirty . marketing: Mm-hmm . Well um that's {disfmarker} project manager: But I mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished , as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: So um we just have to beware of that . I mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the the the problem is quality . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah {gap} . marketing: So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us . industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: Yes , yes . industrial designer: yeah . marketing: And um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , still . marketing: {vocalsound} As we've seen with so many of these kinds of products . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: I'm sorry to interrupt then but I just uh recog I just remembered that there was no {disfmarker} that that was not um included uh {disfmarker} that there was no room for any special features , okay ? industrial designer: Included , yeah . Hmm , user interface: Yeah mm . industrial designer: hmm project manager: So to beware of that . You wanna go to this next slide , marketing expert ? marketing: Uh , well I isn't this my last slide ? project manager: I dunno . marketing: Maybe . project manager: Yes it is . Mm-hmm . marketing: Go ahead . I think that was my last slide , yeah . Um . Mm okay . And I'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard . Um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now , so if you put my last slide back up there . project manager: Oh . marketing: I'm sorry I've um forgot to do that , um . project manager: Why ? Wh why you need that up ? marketing: Hmm ? Well because I can't remember what I put on there . {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Now I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here . project manager: I think you can make it there . marketing: Mm 'kay . You ready . So now we're all supposed to say what we think . Um okay so on shape I gave it a one . Wait what would you ra uh one being good and seven being the worst . user interface: Worse , okay . marketing: Um what do you think the shape is ? user interface: One . marketing: One , okay , and Be Betsy ? project manager: Yes I think uh shape is one . industrial designer: Yeah , even my {disfmarker} yeah , shape is one . marketing: Okay , uh-huh one , okay . And how about on size ? On size {disfmarker} project manager: You {disfmarker} you gave it a four . marketing: I gave it a four , yeah , I feel it's just average . project manager: Um , I dunno . I think I would give it at least a two . marketing: Okay . user interface: One . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah , even I think it is one . It's quite small . marketing: Okay . Okay {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: you're the designer , of course you wanna give it a one . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Um and then how about {disfmarker} how we doing on colour ? project manager: Colour uh I {disfmarker} marketing: Colour , I gave it a one . project manager: One . marketing: I really like all those nice bright , warm colours . project manager: I {disfmarker} I like the colours . One . user interface: One . Yes . marketing: One . industrial designer: Yeah , one . marketing: One , one , one , okay . And how about the feel ? Taking into um consideration texture and comfort in the hand . project manager: Uh , I think I would give it a two . marketing: Okay , I gave it a three , two , user interface: I'll give three . marketing: yeah ? Three . industrial designer: Uh maybe two , marketing: Two , okay . industrial designer: yeah . marketing: And the next is functionality where I I admit I was a little hard on our team here , but {disfmarker} project manager: Well it's also you can't really try it out uh the other things you have have more {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} are more tangible so from that point of view marketing: Yeah . Mm-hmm . project manager: but um {disfmarker} I'll give it a three . marketing: Okay . user interface: Two . marketing: Two , okay . industrial designer: Uh three , mm-hmm . marketing: Three ? Okay . Well , um . It looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product . Um the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} But um otherwise I think we're {disfmarker} we're ready to go to {disfmarker} go with this product . Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ? project manager: Uh . Here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity . Um . Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy ? user interface: We can always improve , yes . industrial designer: Maybe we can {disfmarker} yeah , include some more buttons and uh um user interface: Yes , features . industrial designer: yeah features . We can make the buttons {disfmarker} few buttons smaller . Uh I think they are quite big , so I think {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . If we want to have more features than that . marketing: Mm-hmm . Well then again if we're gonna um {vocalsound} do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah , definitely . user interface: Yes . Voices . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: So that that's where we're gonna have to do {disfmarker} maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons . industrial designer: Yeah , definitely , yeah , two mu mute buttons . user interface: Yes . Yes . marketing: And um then maybe we can do something with the um the volume control . Maybe we can put that all on one button . industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: Um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that . project manager: Y um al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: And maybe {disfmarker} project manager: and that we still you know we probably can't , with this particular item , we probably can't just uh add a whole lot of more things . marketing: Mm-hmm . No . project manager: Uh um we need uh {disfmarker} you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yes . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Um . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: So th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ? Uh , um are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created ? Uh I think {disfmarker} personally I think uh I'm pretty happy . marketing: I'm pretty happy with it too , yeah um , project manager: Um an industrial designer: Even I'm happy . marketing: it's something I think I can market . Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ? Uh {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} I think you've done a good job , Miss leader . {vocalsound} user interface: Yes , yes you've done a good job . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah , definitely . {vocalsound} project manager: And I think team work I think was very very good , I think we really {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: Yeah I d I do too I think we worked well together as a team , yeah .
