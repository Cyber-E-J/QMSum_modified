user interface: Two . project manager: Hello . Hello . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Good morning . marketing: Hello . Ah . project manager: You have to put it exactly on the on the {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: Plate ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Good morning . industrial designer: Good morning . project manager: I took your mouse . industrial designer: Should I bring my uh pen too ? project manager: Yeah just {disfmarker} yeah , no , industrial designer: Or {disfmarker} project manager: that's for me , I just have to make some notes . I got my uh mouse . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: Uh I also forgot my mouse , user interface: Mouse . project manager: {gap} {vocalsound} yeah . marketing: but I don't need my mouse , I think . industrial designer: I do . user interface: Come on . There we are . industrial designer: My laptop is crashing . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} marketing: Damn computers . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Cr marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Help help help . user interface: Let's just check one more time . Mm . marketing: Can you hear me ? Hello ? project manager: Uh actually my laptop doesn't work , marketing: Test . project manager: {gap} switch it on again . marketing: I dunno . project manager: Oh no . marketing: Check . Okay . I think it works . industrial designer: Test test . Yes , it's working . project manager: So you all read what we are going to do or not ? marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah . marketing: We're gonna make a remote control . project manager: Yeah , that's right . industrial designer: I think my laptop is a bit marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: etchy . project manager: I just made a a simple uh presentation . So you {gap} put some things in it . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . How does this work ? I dunno . {gap} user interface: One uh {disfmarker} most to the right . industrial designer: Uh p user interface: Yes that one . project manager: This one ? user interface: Yes . marketing: Press F_ eleven . project manager: Ah cool . Okay . So marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: that's my name , {gap} . Uh we're going to make uh a remote control , you already know that . Just have a look , are we going to {disfmarker} uh this agenda of our meeting . You know , this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting . So um the {gap} thing we have to know is you already know what we're going to do , you also read what this the things {disfmarker} or , not yet , user interface: Yes . project manager: okay . So um , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly {gap} that's what we're going to design . Uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control . Fir the first thing is th the functional design , that's very important . We have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design , it's for the f next meeting . The the second thing is the conceptual design , that's what it {disfmarker} that's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . And we have to look what uh the market is doing for {disfmarker} what kind of uh remote controls are in the market . And the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that's exa yeah , you know what it is , it's exactly how it looks and whatever . {vocalsound} Okay so {disfmarker} uh no , this is a {disfmarker} these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one . And you already saw {disfmarker} you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map . marketing: Folder , project manager: Folder , okay . marketing: yes . project manager: So no okay {gap} have a look at that one . Okay . So uh what we're going to do first is um so you can read . {vocalsound} You have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: and um and say why it's your favourite animal . So and you have {disfmarker} this is just to try it out and we have to uh use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen . So okay , so first have to show you , maybe you can come here to have a look how it works . Yes ? marketing: Ah I can see it now . project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah . project manager: This a new page , it's okay . Use pen format . and a different colour can use here {gap} no I just take the pink . You take {disfmarker} oh there's no pink , okay , oh just purple , okay . user interface: Purple . project manager: No blue . And uh line width {vocalsound} ten . Okay uh just take {disfmarker} what I'm going to draw is an elephant . Just draw slowly , because otherwise it won't work . It's a very nice elephant , you can see . I dunno what it looks {disfmarker} but it doesn't matter . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Looks very nice . project manager: I just h industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Something like this ? Oh no {gap} marketing: {vocalsound} It look like a dinosaurs . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , okay . user interface: {vocalsound} A pink elephant . project manager: Because I like {disfmarker} uh okay . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Just takes so long , okay . Whatever , just . You erased this one . It's a bit slow you can see , this is a bit annoying . marketing: Okay . project manager: Okay , so just for you guys just one of you can draw a painting if you want . Just don't marketing: Let me try one . project manager: um {disfmarker} yeah , just u use it like that , yeah . That's okay . marketing: Okay . project manager: {gap} marketing: Mm . Okay and then uh what's the colour ? How do I do {disfmarker} project manager: It's in format . Yeah . marketing: Ah . I'll take this one . Uh there has to be water , project manager: Just {disfmarker} marketing: but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: No it has to be an animal , so if that's it's {disfmarker} it should be a shna snake or something . marketing: Yeah yeah , but it's an animal it's an animal that lives in the water . project manager: Okay . Okay okay . Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} The water is important . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: So I first uh draw the water . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh . Okay , and now I make the animal . It's a fish . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , industrial designer: {vocalsound} Wow . project manager: cool . marketing: Mm-hmm . So . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: This is a worm . user interface: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} project manager: Hmm yeah , that's nice . marketing: {gap} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Wow . marketing: {vocalsound} Okay , who next ? Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Uh do you have to write down why {disfmarker} uh that doesn't matter , just {disfmarker} it's to get used to the whiteboard , but it's okay . marketing: Okay . project manager: Just make a new blank new blank page . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Well Paul ? {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . Like this ? project manager: Yeah , not too far to the to the t pen top . user interface: Okay . Um marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: let's make it um a dog . Ooh . project manager: Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back , so that {disfmarker} no , to the {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: {gap} Ah okay . marketing: I think it's a pig . user interface: A pig ? project manager: No , it's a dog . {vocalsound} user interface: I can make {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Or a dog . user interface: a dog . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} {gap} Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: A sheep ? {vocalsound} project manager: Uh we d only have twenty five minutes , so {gap} . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Take it easy . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: 'Kay , I make a cat of it . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I I was gonna make a cat too . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Use your fantasy . {vocalsound} user interface: Oh , not too quick . project manager: Just hold it more more to the back then you don't have {gap} user interface: No project manager: okay . user interface: I have it . I just draw too quick I think . Okay , that's it . More . project manager: No , that's okay , thank you . {vocalsound} user interface: It's just to get used to it . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: I thought these pens would be just um {disfmarker} uh you write it down and you download it to Word , you already did it or no ? No , not yet , okay . marketing: No . user interface: Yeah , that's right , project manager: But it's just {disfmarker} user interface: it {disfmarker} but you actually got to write on the paper . project manager: Sorry ? user interface: You really got to write on that paper . project manager: Yeah , I know , but I d I I thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in Word , marketing: Yeah yeah , it's a real pen . project manager: so that's not user interface: Yeah , but it's just a picture . project manager: just {disfmarker} it's just a picture . So {vocalsound} marketing: Oh . project manager: it's not that cool as I th thought it would be . user interface: You really {disfmarker} marketing: Y you can you can't edit in the {disfmarker} edit it in Word . project manager: No . user interface: No . marketing: Oh , okay . user interface: It's a donkey . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: I don't know , what time did we start this meeting , I'm not sure . user interface: Uh I think it was uh {disfmarker} project manager: Half past . marketing: Half past ten . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay . marketing: Brilliant . project manager: Okay , perfect . industrial designer: Nice , eh ? {vocalsound} marketing: Yep . project manager: Yeah , thank you . Now we just have to save everything , so . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Oh industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: this is definitely the best one . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh . project manager: Okay , so uh what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros . Okay , industrial designer: Excuse me . project manager: that's {gap} . And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros , so we have to uh use a big market in Europe . The production cost are about half the price of selling price , user interface: Piece of cake . project manager: sorry . user interface: Uh easy . project manager: So can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , I dunno . Uh so we're gonna have {gap} a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the {gap} and everything , so just have a look how it {disfmarker} we think about remote controls . marketing: Yeah , my first question was does it have to be a {vocalsound} a universal remote control ? project manager: Oh yeah , that's a good question . marketing: Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart . project manager: I think it's {disfmarker} I'm not I'm not sure , marketing: So I {disfmarker} project manager: it's not mm {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , it probably would be universal . user interface: Universal . marketing: Because {disfmarker} {gap} user interface: And only television ? Or more devices ? project manager: I don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros , so {disfmarker} not sure , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm , maybe , I don't know . marketing: Yeah , I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros project manager: Okay , so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control . Okay , perfect . user interface: Ah okay . marketing: Yeah , I think . industrial designer: And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player project manager: Yeah , everything industrial designer: and {disfmarker} project manager: just {disfmarker} so a lot of buttons {vocalsound} on the remote control . industrial designer: okay . {vocalsound} Yeah , probably . user interface: Not just a T_V_ . project manager: No , just everything . user interface: Okay . project manager: {gap} . so yeah , marketing: Okay . project manager: what what what's a remote control , it's just a black thing with some buttons on it , it's not {disfmarker} nothing very special , but um {disfmarker} user interface: Well we can try to make it special . project manager: yeah , that's right . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: So do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user {vocalsound} user interface: Well {disfmarker} marketing: Well I th I thought about um making it the same uh style as the television , {gap} {disfmarker} we don't have uh the same television uh all the time , so uh that's no matter . {vocalsound} Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it uh it has to be clear , because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it , so uh it's not only for the uh technical persons . Um I think it must be a very good control , so you can uh uh uh act uh {vocalsound} use it from uh everywhere in your room , the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality . project manager: Hmm yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: That's right . Should be a good point . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Nothing {gap} N industrial designer: And how big should it be ? marketing: No . Yeah . user interface: {gap} It shouldn't be too big , marketing: I dunno um {disfmarker} user interface: but I don't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think . project manager: Just big enough for the buttons we have , that's that's it . user interface: Yeah . Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer , marketing: Yes user interface: maybe more trendy . project manager: But you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open . user interface: Fold open , project manager: Okay , user interface: where you can see uh more options . I think {disfmarker} project manager: yeah , that's cool . Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something , industrial designer: Yeah marketing: Ah industrial designer: n marketing: that's that's {disfmarker} project manager: if you just {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , something uh on top , just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often . marketing: Ah right right . industrial designer: Yeah , or you c project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control . marketing: Oh that's good , yeah . user interface: Yeah b I wanted {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Uh maybe be uh it's it's {disfmarker} project manager: There are buttons on it . user interface: No you can make an uh manual in it . industrial designer: Yeah , or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small . project manager: Okay . But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it . user interface: But that's {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh like a a to have {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , but user interface: Yeah , I think it's much uh {disfmarker} too expensive . industrial designer: Yeah , maybe it would . marketing: Yeah but it's not reachable I think , touch screen . project manager: {gap} marketing: And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control , project manager: Yeah . marketing: because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken . project manager: Yeah . So . And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile . user interface: Yeah , too fragile . marketing: Yeah and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not uh kids uh {disfmarker} project manager: No . You can put games on your remote control . Whatever . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Kid-proof . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah {gap} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} And uh how about the batteries ? marketing: Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh should you put it in a recharger or a {disfmarker} just {disfmarker} project manager: Oh maybe that's a good idea , marketing: Ma maybe a home station . project manager: just to put it on your television and just s recharge , user interface: Yeah . project manager: you never have to use any batteries . industrial designer: Mm yeah . user interface: Maybe that's a good idea , but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think . project manager: Yeah , how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno . user interface: Well uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger ? project manager: I dunno . industrial designer: Yeah , if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive , project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Ah yeah . industrial designer: but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing . marketing: {gap} user interface: Maybe have {gap} uh {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh if you th look at the market , it's probably {disfmarker} it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because maybe it's too expensive . user interface: Yeah , 'cause well {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , but a home station is uh a really good idea , because uh lots of people are {disfmarker} uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is , project manager: Yeah , that's right , yeah . marketing: and now you can put it always at the same place . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Maybe it's {disfmarker} Therefore it's a good idea , but maybe it's expensive . user interface: Maybe uh use it as a separate option . Sell it uh separately . marketing: Yeah . You can {disfmarker} yeah , you can buy it with it . industrial designer: Yeah , but I have a mouse that's uh uh also uh {disfmarker} user interface: Rechargeable . industrial designer: Yeah , and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: or you can change your batteries , marketing: Oh yeah . industrial designer: so . project manager: The option , just the option , that's cool . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Uh I I set something on paper already , {gap} size , looks , uh usable , uh the buttons on usable places , uh the the on off button must be on top , project manager: Yeah . marketing: uh it has to lay good in the hand , user interface: Yeah . marketing: you you have to uh {disfmarker} project manager: Has it be {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control marketing: Yeah , I don't I don't know I don't know project manager: or {disfmarker} user interface: Well I think we have to look at that , marketing: if we {disfmarker} user interface: 'cause well you can do {gap} the standard way , but then you won't {disfmarker} marketing: You can make it very special , to create our own um looks , project manager: Yeah marketing: but it's very hard to {disfmarker} industrial designer: N uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works . user interface: Well you can um have uh {vocalsound} the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see . marketing: Nah . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: But the rest is uh you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well . project manager: Yeah . user interface: So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: so you can do something unique with that . industrial designer: And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you {vocalsound} can still uh do the th the functions . marketing: Yeah yeah , what Paul already said . project manager: Yeah , just for the T_V_ and just the normal function , that's fine . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Uh on on top are the the basic options on top , industrial designer: But n {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: yeah , but uh i {vocalsound} basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so , marketing: and if you fold it open {disfmarker} project manager: But maybe it's user interface: Yeah {gap} . marketing: {gap} user interface: That's what I meant . industrial designer: so . project manager: maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh {disfmarker} what's it's called ? marketing: Mm . If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an {disfmarker} uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control . project manager: {gap} Maybe it's hard t user interface: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: No , that's right . So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square , just normal remote control {gap} . user interface: Okay , but yeah . project manager: Just think about it . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting , so . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: There's some more things . We have uh another thirty minutes , so then we're going to meet again . So you know what you have to {disfmarker} what you have to do ? marketing: Okay . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert , the user requirements uh specification , do I need to think as a user , a as a a a only the looks and the {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} No , what you want to do with it . project manager: Yeah , I think this {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_ , a D_V_D_ player , all that things . Also from a user , but all these things together . marketing: Okay . Yeah , it's also about strength and uh for everything uh . project manager: Yeah , everything . user interface: Yeah , I also wrote down some stuff project manager: Yeah , user interface: that you want on a {disfmarker} project manager: no maybe not not uh {gap} , that's not a f that's something for for for {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: Technical fun fu project manager: That's not for you . Just if {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . project manager: what's in the market , what's normal , uh what kind of uh buttons do you have . user interface: What do you want to do with your remote control , what do you need on your remote control . project manager: Yeah , it's alright . user interface: I already wrote some down , some ideas . marketing: Yep . project manager: Yeah , just {disfmarker} is that okay ? user interface: Yep . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Okay . user interface: There's already a document in the folder about it . marketing: Yeah , me too . project manager: So see you in thirty minutes . user interface: Okay . marketing: Okay , well done . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: For the next time you have to uh put it exactly on the square , so {disfmarker} your laptop . user interface: I will . marketing: Oh Paul . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: It didn't say that . project manager: No , sorry . user interface: Your fault . marketing: Ciao . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Bye bye . user interface: Bye bye .
