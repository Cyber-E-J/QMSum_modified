project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Mm yeah . project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} I g yeah . Time is it ? marketing: {vocalsound} Fourteen twenty six . project manager: Okay . Lovely to see you all again . Um {vocalsound} it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . Um okay {vocalsound} our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , I'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations um and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . So industrial designer: Okay . project manager: opening . Um these are our minutes from r the functional design . We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different um functions of it . Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . {vocalsound} And s um in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding a sliding piece {vocalsound} and a long-life battery or a charging station . Okay , now three presentations . I'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials {vocalsound} um and then the conceptual specification of user interface {vocalsound} and finally trend watching . industrial designer: That would be me . user interface: Yep . industrial designer: Alright . Well . project manager: Mm . 'kay . Function F_ eight it . There we go . industrial designer: Alright . Um I'm very excited by this one actually guys I uh had a lot of fun doing it . Components design . This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of . {vocalsound} Um . So , we need to examine each element separately , but we're designing a full thing , so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole . The main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as well , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery . These are all things that we had sort of addressed before , but I'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like . The case , uh the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do , um there's there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , just keep that in mind , but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic . That would be our case . Um buttons , for buttons we have um pushbuttons , which is what Real Reaction uses the most often , but we also have scror scroll wheels , project manager: Mm . industrial designer: which can have integrated pushbuttons , or we could go all high-tech and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen . {vocalsound} Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , depending on what our other needs are . And then battery I think is where things get most exciting . We're talking about long-life batteries here . {vocalsound} Um we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries , but we also have these options of um {vocalsound} using a kinetic battery , like are used in high-tech watches , where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up . Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery . Or a solar battery , although there are slight um {vocalsound} complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery . project manager: Hmm . industrial designer: Or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights . Not quite sure what that is , but that's the description that I received , so that's what I'm passing on to you . {vocalsound} So those are our options . Um personal preferences that I was thinking through {disfmarker} here's what we've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity . So if we're going for fashion in our cases , I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case , probably with a variety of design elements . Maybe titanium , maybe some wood . We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials , but that's sort of what I have in mind . And we wanna go for simplicity . Probably pushbuttons , but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything project manager: Mm . industrial designer: any ideas on that ? I mean I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll um buttons which are exactly like what they're describing , so that might be something we wanna look into . And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery . {vocalsound} Solar I don't think would be such a good idea , because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: But this idea of the kinetic , that you don't have to replace , and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work , I think that that m would be a very interesting thing . But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down . Uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an L_C_D_ . So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly t technological if they don't need to be , 'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down . That's what I have for options . Um I'd appreciate anyone's input , but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing . {vocalsound} marketing: Is double-curved like {disfmarker} would be like two hands kind of thing ? industrial designer: I'm not sure . I haven't received any specific marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: visuals of this yet . marketing: 'Cause I'm imagining like double-curved is like , you know , like two sides that curve industrial designer: This is what I'm sort of {disfmarker} marketing: and then like one curve would just be like a single vertical-ish kind of looking thing , industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . I'm not sure , marketing: but I've no idea . industrial designer: but I'll let you know as soon as I get any pictures . marketing: Sounds good . project manager: Yeah , I wonder {disfmarker} industrial designer: I know if we do have a double-curved case , it can't have any titanium in it . But the titanium , they were quite {disfmarker} they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme , so that could be quite interesting . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Space-age remote . project manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Just an interesting marketing kind of element . industrial designer: Just all things to keep in mind . Yeah . {vocalsound} That's about all I have to do , guys . I hope I didn't go through that too quickly . project manager: Uh just a real quick question um the weight of these different elements , have you {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , n project manager: no idea , okay . industrial designer: no idea , no idea . Um I'm assuming that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight , project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: and that a tita titanium is very light , I know , project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: um but other than {disfmarker} project manager: {gap} industrial designer: that's really basic , I mean , that's all I have gotten so far . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Alright ? Any other questions ? user interface: Uh-huh . Don't think so . industrial designer: No ? Okay . project manager: Mm 'kay . industrial designer: I have save this in the uh shared projects , if anyone wants to look project manager: Thank you , perfect . industrial designer: and I have c considerable notes on the topic as well , if anyone needs any more information . Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Thanks . project manager: Um if you made notes yourself you can put those on our um {disfmarker} underneath our {disfmarker} oh , uh in your book , industrial designer: Just in my notebook , project manager: then don't worry about that . industrial designer: but if anyone has any specific questions , don't hesitate to email me or something . Alright ? Uh I guess I can {disfmarker} project manager: 'Kay now we're um concepts concepts of user interface . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , um . This one's so much tighter than the other one . industrial designer: {vocalsound} I know . project manager: Okay . Nope . There we go . Here you are . user interface: Jess . industrial designer: G oh , geez . user interface: Alright , so I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device . Um we've talked about uh the two essential properties of the user interface . We want it to be simple and we want it to be fashionable . Um other {disfmarker} we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose . Uh we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control , so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are and make sure that we include {disfmarker} that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people . We have a number of different choices for a design concept um and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of um , but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: how how {disfmarker} what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device . Uh once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features . And of course we also have to make it look cool . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: So basically , marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: that's what we don't want . {vocalsound} M we don't want lots of buttons , uh complicated features . We want something that looks nice and simple . industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: Here's a a fairly simple device . This is an an iPod from Apple . Um I think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons . It's very minimalistic in its design . Uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen . Um {vocalsound} the thing I like about this is that it's very very quick to access the main features . Uh you can just about make out uh that the button {disfmarker} three buttons are uh previous track , next track and play pause . They're the main the main features of the iPod , the things you will use a all the time . Um then if you want to do anything more advanced , you go into the little menu on the L_C_D_ screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want . So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have . Um {vocalsound} here's a another example . This is uh {disfmarker} it's an interesting idea and I think i it looks pretty cool . Um it's certainly got novelty value . project manager: Mm . user interface: Uh it's nice and colourful , it's nice and bright . Uh it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around . The buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of {disfmarker} yeah if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which and basically , yeah it's ith it's fun . So I {vocalsound} I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often . So you'd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels . I mean most people , when they watch T_V_ , they have two hundred and fifty channels on their T_V_ and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most . So , you have buttons for your favourite channel , changing the volume , which is something you do all the time when you're watching T_V_ , and the button to switch it off , in case you get bored . Um other features , things like adjusting the brightness , tuning the T_V_ , uh I don't know what else you do with a T_V_ . Um but these are these are all necessary functions . Uh you can't have a t there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast , so we need to find a way of including these somehow . Um and one other suggestions I'd make is to in is to include in a menu system , a bit like on the iPod . So we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself , or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device . industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: And that would allow you to access access the advanced features uh whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then ? user interface: I think that's {vocalsound} that's one way to go , yes . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Um I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display , it's it's nice , because it's {disfmarker} it it lets you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: There are disadvantages , an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small , 'cause we're we're {vocalsound} I {vocalsound} industrial designer: Right user interface: well we're {disfmarker} I assume we're gonna be making quite a small device . Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it , 'cause you ten you tend to watch T_V_ in the dark , project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Right . user interface: but you need to be able to see your L_D_D_ L_C_D_ display . The alternative is to have a {vocalsound} an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control . Uh a bit like a bit like how they have these um digital boxes where you you press the buttons and it comes up with your {disfmarker} this thing of watch lo what's on each channel . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: I mean that that's also a good idea . It's it can it does have it's problems as well , if you've got a small T_V_ and you're sitting on the other side of a room , it's hard to read the little text that comes up . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: Uh but that's a that's a design decision that we can make . industrial designer: 'Kay . project manager: I do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Um and so user interface: Yeah . project manager: like favourite channels is is applicable , but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's {disfmarker} um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it . industrial designer: Well {disfmarker} Are you are you tak project manager: Like I I know I use that often enough . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Wait , but is that separate from what he was saying ? project manager: Well industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: if it if it was a L_ L_C_D_ on th on the remote , I don't know that you could f that you'd be able to see a {disfmarker} industrial designer: No , I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on . project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah , that that would be one of the features , yes . project manager: Okay . 'Cause that would be more specifically a digital box , user interface: But it's it's it's something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control the c uh communication is one way , project manager: mm-hmm . user interface: so you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control , at least I don't think you can . industrial designer: Oh , good point . project manager: Mm . user interface: Um I'm not sure . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay , now we're moving on to market . Marketing . marketing: {vocalsound} Should I plug that in ? project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Is that going on ? Okay . marketing: Maybe it's just not {disfmarker} user interface: Uh that should be alright , actually . marketing: Is it on ? Ri What F_ do you have to press , project manager: Eight . marketing: five ? I just keep pressing lots of 'em . Well , I don't know how relevant all of this gonna be . {vocalsound} If anything , the {gap} that they gave me . project manager: Oops , it's not plugged in , quite in well enough . industrial designer: No signal . marketing: Alright . project manager: There we are . industrial designer: Oop , there we go . project manager: Mm 'kay . marketing: Oh yeah . {vocalsound} Okay , so we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching . {vocalsound} Basically , I was given um an executive summary that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} So first um they had people {disfmarker} they ranked um the important aspects of r remote controls , and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference , but that really , over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes , so that just goes back to the whole desire of our c Real Reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so , even though we're stressing , when we're talking , we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea , they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel . And as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one , industrial designer: Okay . marketing: so just to take that weight into account . {vocalsound} The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations . That would be like if we use something like the space material or the L_C_D_ screen , things like that . And then ease of use was the third most important , whi so really , no matter what , we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel , according to this . I don't know how much we agree with that . {vocalsound} And then {vocalsound} the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy , {vocalsound} tight material . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: S sweet . marketing: {vocalsound} And so that brings us to my personal preferences . Who wants a spongy remote or one with {vocalsound} fruit and vegetable padding . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Personally , I don't really think that I want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun , um in a year , so user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} even though this is coming from us as , you know , trend watch , market research , I don't know how much of it we necessarily {vocalsound} wanna take away . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Also , considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction , I'm a little hesitant as to {vocalsound} like , how these questions may have been worded , and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking . Personally , like I might reverse it , but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most . {vocalsound} But {vocalsound} it doesn't necessarily need to be a spongy material . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: That {disfmarker} there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} I don't have a lot of notes to share if you want them , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: that pretty much sums it up . So yeah . project manager: Okay , do we have any {disfmarker} s some questions for this , let's see um . marketing: Yeah , what can I possibly enlighten on ? project manager: Um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ? Um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all ? user interface: {gap} project manager: Like could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ? It would be easier on the hands . industrial designer: If it's latex {disfmarker} if it's latexy {disfmarker} project manager: It's kind of {disfmarker} and then it {disfmarker} industrial designer: Um , mean {disfmarker} project manager: we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that , user interface: A kind of thing that {disfmarker} project manager: I dunno . But {disfmarker} industrial designer: An uh I {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} th {vocalsound} my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside , project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: but that it's covered with the latex , which is spongier and softer on your hands . It's {disfmarker} there's something to be said , I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to {disfmarker} R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: and and {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah , marketing: Yeah , so something , m m instead of a necess industrial designer: something grippable , I mean we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy , maybe . {vocalsound} marketing: yeah , grip , I'm thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands , user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . marketing: you know , i and I think I'm envisioning more like , you know , the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: so that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for a long time , industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: like I'm imagining that sort of thing , I don't know what th that material's called . industrial designer: Yeah , I think that given the list of materials I w I was forwarded it's {disfmarker} that seems doable . {vocalsound} could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? We could colour-co-ordinate them , project manager: F for sure , or maybe like marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: li project manager: um couple main ones being like , I dunno , lemons or strawberries or something . industrial designer: The buttons could be fruit-shaped . project manager: Could they be smelly ? user interface: {vocalsound} I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ? Uh like uh I dunno , like uh carrots or something . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Oh well marketing: {vocalsound} Oh God . project manager: I don't know . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Or carrot shaped , industrial designer: it's quite easy to s shape thing like carrot project manager: mm . industrial designer: isn't it ? user interface: {vocalsound} Maybe , project manager: {vocalsound} Like large button , industrial designer: Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits . user interface: or {disfmarker} project manager: that's what I was thinking of , yeah . marketing: What about the idea of like a round remote ? Instead of like a vertical up and down one . Like in terms of holding it . Like that's a f shape of a fruit . industrial designer: {gap} be {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Kind of like a potato . industrial designer: yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Might {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} It'd be harder to f bu uh buttons I think . project manager: would you think you you {disfmarker} do you think you'd be able to hold it ? marketing: {vocalsound} Just to tie it in a little . project manager: 'Cause I think the reason they're long is {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: It'd be harder to press button . project manager: Harder to push . user interface: Depends . When you when you use a remote , do you press the buttons with your thumb , usually ? Or your fingers ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Um {disfmarker} project manager: I usually hold it in one hand . Maybe {disfmarker} industrial designer: I {disfmarker} user interface: Or maybe you want something that's shaped like a mobile phone , so you you hold it in one hand , and you press the buttons with your thumb . project manager: But then the buttons would have to be very small . industrial designer: Yeah , that's ts how I tend to do it . project manager: Don't you think ? industrial designer: No marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: just thumb-sized . marketing: 'cause otherwise your fingers can't move around . industrial designer: Jus project manager: But I mean in order to get to all of them , marketing: But I like i project manager: you know . user interface: Yeah {vocalsound} . project manager: They would have to be within a certain amount of space with each other . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Maybe . industrial designer: That's true . user interface: But if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway , then it's it's not so much a problem , perhaps . industrial designer: Right . I When I'm when I'm pressing buttons on my iPod , that's how I do it , hold it and press the four . Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: So you hold it in one hand and you press you press the buttons with your thumb project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah , or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel . user interface: and {disfmarker} And you find that works quite well ? marketing: I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod . industrial designer: Yeah project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Is that {disfmarker} marketing: 'Cause th user interface: The button on an iPod , is it {disfmarker} what is it , is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing ? marketing: It's like five , project manager: It's a scroll , yeah , it's a wheel . industrial designer: It {disfmarker} wel well {vocalsound} marketing: 'cause there's one in the middle . industrial designer: yeah , it would {disfmarker} I mean each version of it has been a little bit different , project manager: The one I have doesn't have the four on i like around it , I don't think . industrial designer: but {disfmarker} Oh yeah , you had one of the in-between ones , when they weren't doing that anymore . Ts and you press the centre button , user interface: Right . industrial designer: that's that's your all-purpose select button right there . user interface: Oh , I see , right , yeah . Oh , okay . industrial designer: Since it's the one in the centre that's not marked , yeah . user interface: Yeah , that's quite a good design . marketing: I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Like just the idea of like those {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh uh marketing: so few buttons for main things , industrial designer: t marketing: but then how you could go back to the menu and like , I dunno if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual T_V_ . I kind of am wanting to say on the T_V_ , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: 'cause if you're changing the brightness , don't you wanna see it happening , kind of ? industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: And then you could still have that available . industrial designer: Yeah , I think an {vocalsound} L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice . user interface: I think it could be difficult in practice , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: yeah . Also z yeah , 'cause you would be z looking down at the L_C_D_ screen , than back up at your T_V_ industrial designer: Right . marketing: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . user interface: and people don't wanna do that . industrial designer: Um {disfmarker} project manager: Okay um we have we've about fifteen minutes left , industrial designer: Oh we probably have to get going , don't we ? project manager: so I'm I'm gonna continue with my pres presentation . Um I've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this {disfmarker} these kinds of things , so I'll just bring that up and show you all industrial designer: {vocalsound} 'Kay . project manager: before we move on . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Could {disfmarker} Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? In different fruit and vegetable colours , marketing: If I get any more information of fruits and vegetables , I'll let you know . user interface: Like , to make it different fruits . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , it's possible . project manager: Yeah , and then like the the covers could be spongy latex industrial designer: Exactly . project manager: wherea but the actual model could be titanium . industrial designer: And you could co-ordinate with your house {vocalsound} or whatever . All these options . user interface: I think maybe th the packaging , it should be like a lemon and the the packaging is like the peel . industrial designer: Ooh . user interface: So instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it , and the remote control's inside . marketing: {vocalsound} Well , project manager: Ah hmm hmm hmm . industrial designer: Oh . {vocalsound} user interface: Don't know . {vocalsound} marketing: there we go . The iPod packaging is me like was so {disfmarker} that was like half the fun . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: It's like the way it all comes all cute . industrial designer: Mm . Options . marketing: Lemons ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , um {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: components concept . Energy , chip on print . industrial designer: Uh-hu oh , oh yes . project manager: G industrial designer: Right , I had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get {disfmarker} be necessary but um {disfmarker} project manager: That's th th this is the agenda they gave me . So can you just explain what that is real quick ? industrial designer: Alright , so um decisions , what the {disfmarker} okay deci decisions on energy I'm thinking is based on the battery . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Um I dunno , what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ? project manager: {vocalsound} I think it's awesome . I think it's really cool . industrial designer: Am I {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: Yeah , I mean , it would t totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , um I think it's good , as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is , industrial designer: Right , I haven't gotten any {disfmarker} user interface: but as far as I know , the technology is good . marketing: Costs . industrial designer: yeah , any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery , but um but if we're using a an i a cheaper chip , then it'll even out , I think . marketing: But over time {disfmarker} industrial designer: Um circuit boards . Um yeah , I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced . They're {vocalsound} they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them , and di I think they're quite easily printed on by machine , which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . I wasn't really given any options , I was just given that this is how they're done . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Um yeah , I can't can't really tell you . I can I can tell you a whole lot about how it works . But I don't know any decisions on {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: If they're if they're really options . industrial designer: Yeah . I'm sorry , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: I did f user interface: Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , I think . Uh it's fairly fairly standard . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Um okay , then we'll move on to the case . Um oh bu I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe . industrial designer: Right . Well okay , here's the here's the thing on the chips that I that I got . Um simple , regular , advanced chip on print . The chip on print includes an infrared sensor , so we don't have to worry about that . Um , {vocalsound} 'kay , the pushbutton {disfmarker} if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , and an L_C_D_ requires advanced . Do we want a scroll wheel , or do we just want pushbuttons ? user interface: Um I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . I mean it might be nice for changing the volume . project manager: It would be nice for changing the volume , industrial designer: Oh . {vocalsound} user interface: Uh but {disfmarker} project manager: but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel . 'Cause you don't have control over numbers user interface: I don't think it would really work . marketing: Yeah , it's a {disfmarker} project manager: or {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: Yeah , you really need buttons for changing a channel . industrial designer: th it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll . marketing: {vocalsound} But if you c if you could scroll through the channels , and then the volume would just be user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: We have five minutes left for the meeting , so . marketing: and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as {disfmarker} I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: And otherwise , no matter how may buttons we have , we're gonna have like , you know , black with red sticking out and th no {disfmarker} it's gonna inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: So , have a scroll for volume ? industrial designer: F or for all those secret functions ? project manager: F industrial designer: When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus . user interface: I think {disfmarker} yeah , I think a scroll wheel would be nice , but it's not necessary . Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Right . So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip , depending {disfmarker} and maybe we could table that decision for later . project manager: Um . industrial designer: I don't know . project manager: I think w well {disfmarker} I think when we go on to the une userface , we're gonna have to decide {disfmarker} the interface we're gonna have to decide um whether we're gonna have a scroll or not . industrial designer: Okay . Well , let's think about that while we talk about the case . project manager: Okay , let's do case . industrial designer: Uh I'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing . user interface: Yeah . project manager: I'm a little um I'm a little hesitant about it , because I'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Um {disfmarker} marketing: Oh could it be hard , and then something around it ? industrial designer: Uh yeah , everything I've {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing . industrial designer: N oh wha what I've what I've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that {vocalsound} there's uh like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex . project manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . industrial designer: Not too thick a layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that . project manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . industrial designer: The inside is hard . I don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board , project manager: Ge o industrial designer: I think that that's done for us . project manager: Okay . user interface: 'Kay . Yeah . project manager: So we uh we do want latex . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay . Latex . Um and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Fruity colours . {vocalsound} Okay um let's go to the ufe user interface then we'll come back to the chip I suppose . industrial designer: Oh and we want a curved case , yeah ? Or a double-curved ? project manager: Well , we don't really know what the difference is , right ? marketing: I'm thinking curved of some sort . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , okay . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: We don't really know what the difference {disfmarker} project manager: Um okay , interface , the type and the supplements . So push or scroll , user interface: Um {disfmarker} project manager: right ? Or both ? user interface: Yep . Um {disfmarker} And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 'cause then we can have a a simple chip and it's simpler , it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button . industrial designer: Good point . user interface: So in terms of uh in terms of uh economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons . project manager: Mm-hmm . And if we had a sc an on-screen um kind of thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things . user interface: Yeah , yeah , it's uh {vocalsound} it's it's fairly simple . project manager: I think that {disfmarker} yeah . For channel surfing I think a scroll {disfmarker} an actual {disfmarker} like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , I dunno . industrial designer: Yeah . I say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton , but it's gotta be some more expensive , so I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case user interface: Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Is that okay with you ? industrial designer: because {disfmarker} project manager: How you feeling ? marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . And let's like see if we get anything else . I mean I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it's more just to give it a different kind of look , project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool , then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel . project manager: It might be cool enough . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so we're gonna go with um type pushbuttons , and then supplements , user interface: Yep . project manager: how are we gonna do that ? user interface: Uh what do you mean by supplements , exactly ? project manager: Um I assume that's what else we're gonna {disfmarker} like h ha the um the additional buttons we can use . user interface: Um {disfmarker} project manager: So we're gonna have like a menu button , industrial designer: Oh . project manager: so that we can access on-screen things then ? user interface: Yep . Yeah . project manager: Okay , um so we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through . industrial designer: Alright . user interface: Um in {disfmarker} industrial designer: So what are what are our buttons gonna be ? user interface: Yeah . On off , industrial designer: On off {disfmarker} user interface: uh volume , favourite channels , uh and menu . industrial designer: So like one through five , or {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , yeah marketing: Like a radio type sorta situation ? user interface: about {disfmarker} yeah like {disfmarker} yeah , a bit like radio presets . Um {disfmarker} project manager: Pre-set channels and then we're gonna need um numbers one through zero , right ? user interface: Uh we wouldn't even need the numbers . industrial designer: No . user interface: I think maybe numbers seems {disfmarker} is kind of old-fashioned . project manager: Well , but in order to pre-set a cha oh I guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through . user interface: Yeah , yeah , you can just {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm . user interface: and you need some kind of , I dunno , sort of up down kind of button , industrial designer: Yeah , up down . user interface: but the volume control could double for that , for example . project manager: Mm-hmm . Okay , um finishing the meeting now . Um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: um you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . You'll get specific instructions from your personal coach . industrial designer: Ooh . {vocalsound} user interface: Cool . {vocalsound} marketing: Wow . project manager: Um did we decide on a chip ? Let's go with a simple chip ? industrial designer: Simple chip . project manager: Okay . user interface: Yep . project manager: We are done . Thank you everyone . Oh I di these are already in our shared folder , so . industrial designer: Okay , cool . Clay . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Clay . I wasn't expecting that . {vocalsound}
