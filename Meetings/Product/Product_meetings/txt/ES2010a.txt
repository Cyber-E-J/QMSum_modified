Okay , industrial designer: Yep . project manager: so first let's go through this PowerPoint . I wonder what button I press ? user interface: Just do it on the {gap} arrow . industrial designer: {gap} project manager: Yeah , or how about I just click ? Okay , here is our agenda for this meeting . Um we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions . {vocalsound} We're gonna get to know each other a little bit better . Um tool training , we're going to , I guess , figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles . Um we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting . Okay , here is our project . We're gonna make a new remote control that's um original , trendy and also user-friendly . And how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um {disfmarker} We're gonna have {disfmarker} discuss the functional design first , {vocalsound} how is it gonna be used , what's the actual goal here , it has to operate T_V_ , blah blah blah . And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet . Same thing with conceptual design . Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work , meet . That's pretty much the the whole process for today . And then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote . Okay . Alright . First we're gonna start off by using our tools . And the whiteboard thing , do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here . industrial designer: I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing . marketing: We could {disfmarker} Yeah , we could on here . project manager: Alright , let's go forward then . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Um right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal . Even if you are not a good drawer like me . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Alright . industrial designer: Artistic skills , nil . user interface: Fine . project manager: Um . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Oh , thanks . {vocalsound} project manager: Bless you . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} I draw like I'm in grade five . project manager: {vocalsound} Oh do I . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} 'Kay , about one more minute . {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . And who would like to start us off ? marketing: I'll go . project manager: Alright . marketing: {vocalsound} Um this is my picture . I drew fish {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I like fish , because uh , you know , their whole water-vascular system thing . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: It's pretty cool , and um they've got a pretty good habitat and they are pretty sometimes , sometimes vicious but that's okay . project manager: {vocalsound} Only if they're piranhas . marketing: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , they they're easy , you know . project manager: Alright . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Who wants to go next ? industrial designer: I'll go . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I drew a kitty . It's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat , but I love cats . marketing: No I I see it . project manager: No , it looks like a cat . user interface: No , I kne I knew . marketing: Yeah , it does look like a cat . industrial designer: I love cats because they're independent , uh they pretty much know what they want , they get it , they move on . {vocalsound} project manager: I love cats , too . I'm a cat person . user interface: Yeah . marketing: I'm allergic to cats . project manager: Uh . industrial designer: I'm allergic to cats , too . {vocalsound} user interface: Ah . marketing: {vocalsound} Oh , okay . {vocalsound} project manager: If you're around one {disfmarker} user interface: In my next life . project manager: I had a roommate who was um allergic , but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it , you know , marketing: Yeah , yeah , if you're around them for a long period of time {disfmarker} project manager: it's weird . Okay . {vocalsound} industrial designer: I still can't sleep with them in my room . marketing: Oh , yeah , this summer I , oh I had to live with cats . It was crazy . project manager: Okay , Fenella ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: Um , I drew a badger . {vocalsound} project manager: Badger . Good choice . industrial designer: Yay . marketing: Cool . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Well , yeah . project manager: Why a badger ? user interface: {vocalsound} Uh I dunno , they're grumpy and nocturnal and {vocalsound} {gap} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Are you trying to suggest something ? project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Well , a little bit like the {disfmarker} Yes . Um . {vocalsound} And then , if you know Wind in the Willows {gap} badger . marketing: Oh , okay . user interface: Yeah and then uh I don't know if you know Brian {gap} . He's Liverpudlian writer . project manager: Alright . user interface: Um {gap} , that kind of books . Badgers are cool in that one too . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . And I'm last . 'Kay . Look at my sad sad giraffe . marketing: No , that's good . project manager: No , no , no , it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur , but whatever . I don't know even much about giraffes , but I just love the way they look . They're just such odd creatures , you know . I I like that they're so unique and individual , I guess . I don't know much about their behaviour or anything , though . Only seen a couple in zoos . marketing: You don't really have to , I mean , if you like 'em {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , but you can appreciate the way they look . Okay . Alright . Guess we're getting straight back into business here . user interface: {gap} project manager: Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro , and our profit aim is fifty million Euro . We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States , in Europe , in Asia . And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote . Okay . So we're gonna talk for a little while . Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss . Expe our experiences with remote controls um , our first ideas about this new remote , anything that you can bring to the table for this project . So . user interface: Now ? project manager: Yeah . You wanna start us off ? Anybody have anything to offer ? user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well , we wanna make a multifunctional remote , right ? project manager: Right . industrial designer: One remote for everything . user interface: And everything being {disfmarker} Wait , we have what , sound system , T_V_ , D_V_D_ , V_H_S_ , uh TiVo ? marketing: Right . industrial designer: Um . I think they'll be phasing V_H_S_ out shortly . marketing: Yeah , TiVo . project manager: TiVo . user interface: But it's still there , so industrial designer: Okay . user interface: if po if we're gonna do it {disfmarker} marketing: It needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal . project manager: They're never universal . That's right . Esp e especially if you buy a a not big product , D_V_D_ player , say , usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the {disfmarker} user interface: Or if it's not like a Sony , if it's like a {disfmarker} I don't know . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . Something from Sam's club . industrial designer: So we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals . project manager: Yeah . marketing: And what we need an insanely good instruction booklet , because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways . project manager: Yeah . 'Kay , and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product , how it feels in your hand . If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't {disfmarker} Nobody wants to buy those any more . They want the ergonomic ones . marketing: They want like the flashy lights . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Oh like this came from Las Vegas . project manager: Ones that ones that look high-tech , too . user interface: But at the same time are simple . project manager: Right . marketing: Mm yeah . project manager: So that people like my mother can use it . industrial designer: What about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: 'Kay . Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that {disfmarker} user interface: Just bad ones . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah {gap} . {vocalsound} That's true . user interface: Um . industrial designer: What kinda battery would we want to use ? Because battery changing is usually {disfmarker} user interface: D Double A_ . marketing: Double A_ . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Do some of them use triple A_s though ? marketing: Yeah some use triple A_s . project manager: Okay . user interface: Some but {disfmarker} marketing: So double or triple ? user interface: Yeah , I guess then it's {disfmarker} If we need to do triple A_ we can , but most people usually have double A_s around . project manager: Okay . Yeah . But that has to do with the size of it too . Well , w as long as we know that issue is {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Right . project manager: Here we can {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , if we want it to be more thin , then we'd probably wanna go with a triple A_ . project manager: Triple A . But industrial designer: Can you {gap} with a small lithium battery ? project manager: it's okay , we don't have to decide about it now , just as long as we remember battery type and size is important . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Hey . Anything else ? Alright . Moving along . Oh , we're closing the meeting . Next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes . Here's what we're going to do . Um the I_D_ , which is who ? Okay , you're going to think about the working design . What do you think that means ? {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . And U_I_D_ , the technical fun functions design , user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do , the functionality of it , operating all those different things . Okay . And the marketing person , that's Courtney , is going to do the user requirements specification . I guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for . Right ? I would think so . Okay . marketing: Right . project manager: And you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while . Okay , so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting ? Okay . This meeting is officially over .
