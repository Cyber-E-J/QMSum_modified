project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Je croix que c'est dommage de le {disfmarker} it will be sad to destroy this prototype . It really looks like a banana . user interface: {vocalsound} It is a banana . project manager: It is a banana . {vocalsound} user interface: It is the essence of bananas . I would be confused with this thing . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Mm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: S project manager: Okay . marketing: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} user interface: How is everyone ? project manager: Hi . industrial designer: Hi . project manager: So we are here for the detailed design meeting . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: we will uh {disfmarker} I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . Then uh I've {disfmarker} I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you uh a summary then as usual . We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . Then we will uh evaluate the product . And uh end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with {disfmarker} it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . So industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say uh to have a standard battery , {vocalsound} to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: to be uh to feel spongy , user interface: Like a banana . project manager: {vocalsound} and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros . So which is uh good , because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: So for the financial aspect it's okay , we can uh {disfmarker} we can continue with this product uh as if , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Okay . So uh you can have my project in {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . You have a presentation ? marketing: Uh yeah just a {disfmarker} project manager: Participant four , yes . marketing: {vocalsound} Four . Evaluation . project manager: Okay . Okay . marketing: Okay . So you can go . We can go through . project manager: Okay . marketing: So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to {vocalsound} the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings . So you can go through and {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . marketing: okay so uh we have uh six points . We we talked about before . project manager: Okay . marketing: So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , {vocalsound} easy to find in a room , and robust , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: uh and uh uh I have a scale of uh seven points . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Okay . So I go through all the uh all the points here , project manager: Yeah . marketing: and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point , two point or seven point . Okay ? project manager: Okay . marketing: And after we ha we have an an average , and uh we see . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: The {disfmarker} okay ? {vocalsound} Uh so uh fancy look and feel , what do you think ? project manager: Okay . Maybe you can presen {vocalsound} marketing: F between o one and seven . project manager: okay . Maybe {disfmarker} {vocalsound} hold it . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} So I think it's uh very uh very nice . What do you think ? user interface: I give it a {disfmarker} I give it a five . project manager: Yeah . So it's between one and seven ? Seven is the highest uh ? marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} Seven is the {disfmarker} project manager: I will give a six . industrial designer: I will give a a five . marketing: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . user interface: {vocalsound} And you ? marketing: {gap} sorry . user interface: Do you vote uh Christine ? marketing: {gap} eh ? user interface: Do you also vote ? marketing: {vocalsound} No , I just want to see something {disfmarker} project manager: Maybe we all have to agree on a common {disfmarker} user interface: Well , we can {gap} very easily {vocalsound} . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh I think uh {gap} {vocalsound} and need to {gap} as well {vocalsound} . project manager: No problem . So user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Need to {disfmarker} project manager: this is your {disfmarker} marketing: uh I don't know if you {disfmarker} we ha we have to put uh one uh f If it's better or {disfmarker} project manager: One is most {gap} . user interface: I {disfmarker} marketing: Uh-uh . project manager: Well , we can choose what we want . marketing: Um . Yeah . project manager: Okay , let's say that seven is the best . marketing: Or maybe we can say s seven is the best mm {vocalsound} . project manager: Okay . So so do note the grade we have five , six for me , industrial designer: Five . project manager: five . And what what's your choice ? marketing: Oh sorry . {vocalsound} project manager: How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ? marketing: Six {disfmarker} Uh s you can {disfmarker} how much what ? project manager: How much would you {disfmarker} you don't answer to this uh questionnaire ? marketing: Oh yes I mm I dunno mm , I think six , it's a good uh {disfmarker} user interface: So it will have five point five average . project manager: Five point five average . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay . user interface: Mm . marketing: Wa can {gap} . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . project manager: Well , does it {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} I sorry . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . So after , the technological aspect ? project manager: Okay , techne technological aspect . marketing: So we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel . project manager: Yeah , we have the wheel . We also have the rubber material , marketing: Uh . project manager: which make it uh like new also . I think I would give a five . user interface: It's {gap} four . project manager: Four ? industrial designer: A four also , because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: The rubber is {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Uh a four . I I {disfmarker} user interface: D are we including the voice {disfmarker} are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not ? Huh ? project manager: No . user interface: No . Okay . project manager: So marketing: No . project manager: what's your uh grade ? marketing: Four . project manager: Four ? So we have four , four f and five ? marketing: We can put four ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , four . Four , yeah , let's put four . user interface: For twenty five . marketing: Everyone is okay or {disfmarker} four poin Four . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Okay . project manager: Doesn't it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Very easy to use . Do you think it's easy to use ? project manager: Yeah , I think so . Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: I give a seven , I think . industrial designer: Six . project manager: I would give a {disfmarker} I would give a seven as well . It's very easy to use . industrial designer: Six . marketing: Mm , six for me also . project manager: So user interface: 'Kay . marketing: Six point five . {vocalsound} project manager: six point five . industrial designer: Six six six point five . project manager: Okay . marketing: Okay . {vocalsound} Is it fashion ? {vocalsound} project manager: Oh yeah , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: its its f its fruit fruit shape . marketing: Seven ? {vocalsound} project manager: I would say seven .

Seven , okay . user interface: Yeah . Well , we hope . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Easy to find . marketing: {vocalsound} Uh easy to find in a room ? {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} I lost my banana . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: I think you can't miss it . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Okay . marketing: Yeah ? industrial designer: Uh . user interface: Yeah , I think it's cool . I think we can put a six here . marketing: We have the lightning , or {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , we have {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} marketing: The lighting . project manager: we don't sesh especially have the lightning user interface: {vocalsound} So you'll make the material transparent project manager: but {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: so that it uh lights up completely , or {disfmarker} project manager: So it's yellow .

Five {vocalsound} project manager: Six is okay ? user interface: Six , yeah , for me . industrial designer: Six . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: S now {vocalsound} um so . project manager: Tadada . We have to sum up everything . user interface: Twenty . marketing: Thirteen uh , twenty , twenty six point five , uh seven , thirty two , thirty six {gap} . user interface: Thirty . Thir marketing: That's that's okay ? Six . project manager: {vocalsound} Six is a good {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . marketing: Good . Uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better , project manager: Yeah , the be . industrial designer: {gap} user interface: Yeah , the top {disfmarker} marketing: and when uh s six sit six are good {disfmarker} it's a good uh p product , I think . project manager: Okay , so six is a {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . So will become eight soon ? project manager: So it's a good evaluation , I think . It's very promising . user interface: Yeah , well it's a bit biased . {vocalsound} project manager: Huh . marketing: We have a good price and uh {vocalsound} . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So this prototype is quite nice . {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . marketing: Good . user interface: Because I saw uh some phones that were banana shaped , uh wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . Okay . user interface: uh quite big also , marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: and they were selling {gap} something like a hundred Euros , two hundred Euros . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Just a {vocalsound} just a phone , wireless . project manager: So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive , I think . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . project manager: I think the {disfmarker} industrial designer: But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not {disfmarker} cannot compare . user interface: Yeah . Yeah , project manager: Yeah . user interface: it's much more complex , but {disfmarker} project manager: So , I think , we can summarise . So we have seen the prototype . It's very nice according to the work of our two designer . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: The the the financial aspect were okay . We we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit . The the evaluation give satisfying result as well . So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: So the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is okay , so I th I think we can now uh open champagne and make a huge party . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Start to eat banana . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: I don't know if it's provided by uh by the meeting staff . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay so congratulation . {vocalsound} Nice product . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} Congratulations to the team . Uh very well , we worked together fantastically . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: I think it was a good collaboration uh . Aspect . user interface: {vocalsound} So what does the management say ? project manager: Sorry ? user interface: What does the management say ? project manager: I think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well . user interface: Ah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: All it depends on who watch this meeting . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} We don't know . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so user interface: Okay . project manager: good guys {vocalsound} , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: so see you for next uh successful project . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay .
