project manager: Can I close this ? user interface: Uh we don't have any changes , do we ? project manager: Oh , okay . user interface: So no . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} There we go . Okay , here we are again . Detailed design {disfmarker} oh , come on . Well {disfmarker} Ah {gap} s Forgot to insert the minutes , but it's about the same thing we discussed before . Uh {disfmarker} Could open that anyway , think . Other design {disfmarker} anyway , we took as {disfmarker} we took w we took rubber as as the material last time . We also {gap} that you're just busy with it . Took the advanced chip to t uh implement the advanced features . Well , we discussed the design , no sharp corners , we rounded it off , like you see on the {gap} other screen , which is fine . Um {gap} we agreed that the colour should be b uh yellow and black . Yellow in the back because it's m trendy , more trendy than black anyway . So {vocalsound} then we ca yeah . We agreed that we would implement both the L_C_D_ and speech recognition , but I'll get to that in a moment . 'Cause some changes in the finances have left us implications anyway . So so , like I said , we had no insight in finances , no prices , marketing: Hmm . project manager: but we have 'em now , and it's bad . Anyway . We are Oh . Prototype presentation , well first you guys built the prototype . So {vocalsound} you could {gap} {disfmarker} could present that . But um let's see what be handy to do . Nee {disfmarker} no , you just go ahead and present the {disfmarker} w we'll scrap it later because {disfmarker} {gap} What ? industrial designer: I think it's more or less the same as we had . user interface: It's basically what we agreed upon , marketing: Hmm ? project manager: Oh that's user interface: but just a little bit more specified . industrial designer: No much s project manager: hasn't changed that much , huh ? industrial designer: No no no , not at all . project manager: I didn't expect anyway {gap} . You just coloured it . {vocalsound} user interface: Uh s Final design . {vocalsound} Basically in {gap} {disfmarker} what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components , as you can see right over here . project manager: Mm-hmm . I like the menu . user interface: We chose a different type of colour for the menu . A bit darker yellow so that it com really shows in this keypad . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: If you put them all black , it's not really that good a contrast . project manager: And I suppose the the the yellow is not printed on the on the rubber . It's it's part of the rubber , I suppose . user interface: So {disfmarker} Probab project manager: I think that's more I think that's more durable anyway than printed on to {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . That's the be industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: And it {disfmarker} I guess it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber industrial designer: Yeah , of course . user interface: than to uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: That's uh the integration story again . marketing: Mm yeah . Okay . user interface: So we have it's a bit round shaped , project manager: {vocalsound} Oh yeah . user interface: that's what we had uh {disfmarker} We chose the buttons to be uh teletext , okay button , favourite channel and the mute . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: So that's basically what we chose there . project manager: Okay . user interface: If you have anything to add , please interrupt me . industrial designer: No , uh this is just a description of what we see there . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Oh . industrial designer: Speaks for itself . marketing: Yeah . user interface: That's pretty much it . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . Now it's my time to ruin everything . Well , not ruin everything , but {disfmarker} no , nah . user interface: Oh sorry . {vocalsound} project manager: Finances , that's what we have here , what you drew . We have battery power , we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor . The sample sensor and uh {disfmarker} for speak recognition anyway . So which {disfmarker} you see the {disfmarker} which is de o one of the most expensive parts . So {disfmarker} well , we have sin one curve , {vocalsound} a design . Rubber design . And we had a special colour . Suppose yellow is a special colour . So just half a Euro for {gap} {disfmarker} You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display . You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost , industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: which is higher than the twelve and a half that we are permitted to use . So , marketing: Hmm . project manager: easy . What do we scrap . Well think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition . industrial designer: I d user interface: I'd say that too . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Because the L_C_D_ has more support on customer side . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: There are ninety one percent of uh the people , or something like that . But ninety percent who favour an L_C_D_ display , and only sixty percent that favour speech recognition . I think it's also harder to {disfmarker} user interface: Uh we don't really have a extra function with the speech sample , marketing: Yeah . user interface: which you can't do with a normal remote control , industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: {gap} . So I ju user interface: which people already do . So {disfmarker} project manager: I took that out . So {disfmarker} and so it's still stuck with thirteen , so I had to take out the special colour I suppose . And , yeah , I didn't see anything else I could take out . Yeah , I could take out the push-buttons , marketing: Pushbut project manager: but we need those . So , generally what I came up with , in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and a half Euros , spe scrap speech recognition industrial designer: Huh . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: Special colour , yeah . project manager: and the separate covers can account for the {disfmarker} if people want it , we'll just {disfmarker} then we'll do it in black . We'll just deliver it in black , have the {disfmarker} it has all the function that it's supposed to have , and if you want it {disfmarker} if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers . user interface: Well , project manager: You make it d orange or whatever you want . user interface: I'd {disfmarker} I tend to disagree with you on that , because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this . project manager: It was a big issue , but {disfmarker} user interface: So can't we just basically extend it to thirteen ? project manager: I'll just go back . Uh let's just {disfmarker} let's see what {disfmarker} okay , let's just see what we {disfmarker} no , we we have to be under twelve and a half . marketing: Yeah , it {disfmarker} project manager: It {disfmarker} it's not {disfmarker} marketing: The p project manager: uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half , industrial designer: Okay , but there's another problem . marketing: And the p project manager: so . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: But there's another problem . marketing: What {disfmarker} industrial designer: If we take another cover , for instance black , then we also need another button frame , 'cause black and black doesn't work obviously . project manager: I think you {disfmarker} that's what you were ass assigned to do really , to to see how b th both those work together . industrial designer: Huh . Huh . Yeah . project manager: So I think {disfmarker} yeah , it's {disfmarker} I think it's y one of the {disfmarker} it's a good way to um to help people uh to make {disfmarker} to keep the product trendy too . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: Just keep {disfmarker} you just make new covers for the {disfmarker} for it , industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: like we agreed before . industrial designer: Right . I agree . project manager: And everything that's left is is the basic function that uh that we want our product to have . Because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip . But we need that for the L_C_D_ display . user interface: Yeah . We do . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Then again , we have the L_C_D_ display , which is also expensive . B yeah , but those go together . And yeah , we could take out the curve . industrial designer: Or say let's lose rubber , take plastic . user interface: We could take out a curve indeed . project manager: Could {disfmarker} we could take out the curve . Is that an option ? industrial designer: Yes . marketing: {gap} . project manager: For you ? industrial designer: Although we are demolishing a little bit the style . marketing: But uh the {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} user interface: I think the colour is more important than the really the curve , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: But {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control {disfmarker} project manager: I think it's {disfmarker} it it does ruin it , marketing: Yeah . The people {disfmarker} project manager: but the fact that I t took that decision or t industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Took this example actually , not really decision , but the example is because we do offer the um {vocalsound} the possibility of adding your own custom covers . So you can change {gap} any colour you want . So it's just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want . industrial designer: Can we then not also uh change the material ? We take plastic for the basic cover project manager: You can take plastic , industrial designer: and {disfmarker} project manager: but I d it's something that's stuck into my mind is that {disfmarker} something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of {disfmarker} the spongy feeling of the {disfmarker} marketing: Spongy , yeah . industrial designer: We can put those to the to the other covers . project manager: and it really makes it {disfmarker} also makes it different from the existing remote controls , marketing: Yeah . project manager: because they're all plastic . marketing: And {disfmarker} project manager: So which in in turn {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: That's true . project manager: Rubber would increase durability industrial designer: But {disfmarker} project manager: because it doesn't break . industrial designer: okay . But what do you then suggest we'd lose ? Because we have to lose two things and {disfmarker} I guess . project manager: I al like I said , I lost the speech recognition and I lost the special colour , marketing: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yes . project manager: which would make this black a black and grey . industrial designer: Okay , and that's enough ? project manager: Yeah , that's that that that's enough , because user interface: So black and grey is okay . project manager: I guess those are the basic colours . marketing: But {disfmarker} project manager: So {disfmarker} Oh . user interface: {vocalsound} Which we can fabricate , industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: I think those are basic col They want to {disfmarker} user interface: okay . marketing: The people want to pay for for it , so why why uh {vocalsound} do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half ? project manager: To ensure the profit . That {disfmarker} that's th that's the order . We're just uh {disfmarker} we're the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company marketing: Yeah . project manager: which say we don't wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this . marketing: But we can take a risk . project manager: But that's not for our {disfmarker} that's not our decision to take . We have a budget of twelve fifty per product . user interface: No , we basically {disfmarker} marketing: Okay , yeah . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: So {disfmarker} user interface: We need to stick to that . project manager: Stick that . I don't think it's really bad either . I mean if we we have the the backup of {disfmarker} or the backup design thing marketing: I hope the people will like it , project manager: to have {disfmarker} marketing: but {disfmarker} project manager: I think they would do . Th I think they do like because yo we {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea , marketing: {gap} {disfmarker} project manager: because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product , one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect industrial designer: Perhaps we should make m marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: and keep the functionality between {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget . industrial designer: Huh . marketing: The first sheet . project manager: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost . And that's {disfmarker} uh they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost , that they know that . project manager: {vocalsound} Well I don't think {disfmarker} Yeah . Is it worth {disfmarker} is it is it {disfmarker} industrial designer: Perhaps they decide tha user interface: But they don't {disfmarker} project manager: does it mean anything to the customer ? Like , it {disfmarker} like , we don't care {disfmarker} we don't care that you had to {disfmarker} industrial designer: Of course . Perhaps {gap} they uh {disfmarker} no , but perhaps they think uh okay , the cover is such a nice idea , uh let's {disfmarker} that that then they uh that allow us to make some more costs . project manager: True , industrial designer: We ca we uh we can at least tell them that {disfmarker} project manager: but we did we didn't get that . So I think it's {disfmarker} industrial designer: You don't know that . project manager: it should either be a pack , maybe we sh that should be sold in in the s in stores with with a standard cover or something . user interface: Well {disfmarker} industrial designer: Huh . project manager: But {disfmarker} industrial designer: No , I'm not uh talking about that cost {gap} but the one that g has given us the order to design this . We could at least m uh make it like this , like you said , project manager: They could , but uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: and then tell them okay , we had to drop this and that , just that you know . It is an {disfmarker} still an option , but {vocalsound} not for this price . project manager: It's an option , but {disfmarker} yeah , it's true . So actually uh it's not that much of an increase , but yeah . We cannot contact them . user interface: And if we {disfmarker} project manager: It's just the order that we got . industrial designer: Exactly , project manager: So that's what we gotta go with . industrial designer: but {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: So it's either one fi just just to get it f just to get it through final , it's either {vocalsound} turned into plastic , drop the squishy feel , make it make it more breakable , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: um or turn it yellow . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's uh something we have to decide on . industrial designer: I'd say lose the curve and the colour project manager: I say lose the curve . Oh that's true , industrial designer: and {disfmarker} project manager: we could lose the c I forgot that , yeah , sorry . Uh the curve . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: So which curve is that ba project manager: That's just this one just d this is the banana curve . user interface: that's basically that curve . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: So this would this would be straight . user interface: So we could u still have the comfort . marketing: Yeah , that's better . project manager: No , uh {disfmarker} no , that would be a curve inside the thing , I guess . No , would ju then it would just be a straight remote . Just like {vocalsound} like that . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: Which would , yeah , turn it into something far more ordinary . {gap} we could make it yellow then , user interface: I second that . project manager: but {disfmarker} You second that , you second that we lose the curve . user interface: {vocalsound} No , that it would turn out to be a pretty straight-forward remote control . project manager: Okay , yeah . user interface: So that's not really that {gap} {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve {vocalsound} to separate it from the rest of the remote control world , so to speak . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: So we keep the curve . So the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber . user interface: I would {disfmarker} project manager: And I'm in favour of keeping the rubber , because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Oh . I agree . user interface: Yeah . I would say {disfmarker} I would agree with you on the colour , industrial designer: No . marketing: Yep . user interface: because that's an extra option , an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money . project manager: Mm-hmm . Yeah , um user interface: So we can always do that . project manager: I guess people are willing to pay for that . So I think we can take that option and just {disfmarker} with uh with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control . industrial designer: Hmm ? marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: So I think that would still make it a nice product . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Okay , we're final on that . So {vocalsound} it's too bad we can't make the whole super thing . But anyways we're here . Um yeah . user interface: Which is basically what we discussed . project manager: This we discussed just now . That's just now {disfmarker} just {disfmarker} we could just discuss how the project went . I mean , was kind of {disfmarker} marketing: And I want to do that . project manager: I sort of expected that everything would turn out this way , but because you {disfmarker} yeah , everything cannot be for free . We didn't {disfmarker} I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time . Because that was {disfmarker} I th user interface: Yes , industrial designer: Huh . project manager: it was really essential really user interface: we could have {disfmarker} project manager: to ma because we spent uh uh entire stage designing a product of which we had no idea what it would cost . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: So we just put something {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: I think it's really nor not in stroke with reality actually . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Me too , I felt a bit blind throughout the project , project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: because in the beginning I had no list of available materials , project manager: Yeah , I think {gap} {disfmarker} would have been . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Materials would be ok industrial designer: and then I d had not list of available c finances . marketing: But {disfmarker} project manager: at least the last meeting I would have expected had to have that . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} project manager: So I suppose {disfmarker} marketing: Let's um {vocalsound} see {gap} um {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , let's see if it sells . I mean I suppose this sells , because it's very {disfmarker} {vocalsound} very extended . marketing: Um {disfmarker} project manager: But {disfmarker} user interface: Well I hope it sells . {vocalsound} marketing: Let's {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} project manager: I suppose it sells , industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: because it's good . marketing: Oh . project manager: I mean it's got everything for the for the reasonable price , because we didn't know what it's gonna cost anyway . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Hmm . Okay , let's eval evaluate uh the product of us , our design . Um I have some {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh a method , a requirements and scale of . I uh will pre present uh some statements and we will decided together wha what {disfmarker} if it's true or false project manager: Okay . marketing: and uh then we see uh if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not . project manager: {vocalsound} Have been met , okay . marketing: And I will uh make a new blank sheet project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: So so the buttons , the look and feel . I thought it was okay , but the advanced uh settings , um screen , audio and channel {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} They're stuck under menu . user interface: Which are basically accessible through the menu button . marketing: We are not {disfmarker} project manager: For the menu . I think those are totally met , industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: because we we really took them for the {disfmarker} they have the feel they want , marketing: Oh the menu button is it . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Hi Oh , okay . project manager: they have the simplicity they want . marketing: Then it's all uh {disfmarker} S project manager: I think it's very uh very well met . Either two or one maybe . industrial designer: One . marketing: it's true . project manager: I think we took that {disfmarker} everything they wanted into consideration . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So it could either be a two or a one . marketing: So d Oh wait . Uh pen . project manager: One and a half . {vocalsound} user interface: Which is not an option . {vocalsound} marketing: The p Oh yeah , project manager: Just create our own option . {vocalsound} marketing: it's red , okay , but {disfmarker} Look and feel is everybo it's true . project manager: Yeah . marketing: So {disfmarker} Anyone ? And the next one {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} yeah , when it's lost uh you can find it . project manager: It's perfect . Even for deaf people , yeah . marketing: It's {disfmarker} project manager: It's {disfmarker} I don't think it's perfect , but we did everything possible to to get it back . industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: To make it that way , yeah . project manager: Because if it's stuck in you couch , you can see the light . Maybe you can hear it . But I mean we tried , marketing: Yeah . project manager: so I think it {disfmarker} that's {disfmarker} that deserves a one . Definitely . marketing: And it's and it's {disfmarker} yeah . To {gap} . That's okay then . And the next one . How is that ? Uh w we had {disfmarker} we don't have an uh manual , industrial designer: Manual . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: yeah . industrial designer: I think the L_C_D_ display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control , marketing: But I think that's a part of it . But {disfmarker} project manager: I'd use an {gap} remote control . user interface: Mm yeah . industrial designer: but then again , it's for young people . So {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , an L_C_D_ , it tells a lot about uh {disfmarker} user interface: And it's pretty straight-forward , industrial designer: Yeah , I th project manager: It's pretty straight-forward , uh-huh . user interface: you have a navigation {disfmarker} no keys to navigate through the L_C_D_ menus . industrial designer: Exactly . No , that's true . I think it won't be a big problem . marketing: Yeah . user interface: So {disfmarker} marketing: So it's a one user interface: One I d no , marketing: or a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't know . user interface: actu project manager: I think {disfmarker} but we didn't even {disfmarker} marketing: For the advanced uh settings . project manager: there was no issue on making a manual actually . We didn't {disfmarker} {gap} really discuss it , marketing: No okay , that {disfmarker} uh that's true . project manager: but I don't think it takes {disfmarker} no , it really does doesn't take time to learn , I think . We took it s it's so easy , user interface: No , it it is pretty straight-forward . marketing: Oh , so it {disfmarker} project manager: we have so little button , everything speaks for itself really . So I think that's {disfmarker} industrial designer: Ah . Um {disfmarker} project manager: yeah , we didn't {disfmarker} it's either two or one , I guess . marketing: Takes no ti project manager: Maybe it's a two , because d uh the L_C_D_ is a little is a little new and there is {disfmarker} there are some option hidden under the menu button . industrial designer: With the more important functions on . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So I might make this a two instead of a one , I guess . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: And the L_C_D_ , you have to see it . project manager: So just make that a two . marketing: Um mm {disfmarker} Oh , it's a little bit learning . Okay . Uh yeah {vocalsound} it's uh a little bit same . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: But it tells you or not ? project manager: You can use the L_C_D_ in a good way . I think so . I think it's perfect , the w where it is , what it can do , if it useful . I think so . marketing: But wha w industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: oh , yeah . What are we uh displaying on the L_C_D_ screen ? Just uh only the channels and {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} industrial designer: {gap} the menus uh {disfmarker} Things like brightness and uh those kind of things we've put in the menu , marketing: What uh ? industrial designer: because we have no buttons for those . user interface: Well , basically the menu options indeed . But {disfmarker} marketing: Oh , in the L_C_D_ screen . project manager: No , y I mean in the L_C_D_ screen , the small screen . What does it display ? industrial designer: Yes . marketing: And for a channel selection , uh {gap} {disfmarker} or that's not {disfmarker} project manager: Well I thought it was I thought it was {disfmarker} I thought that people wanted previews on their {disfmarker} I'm not sure if that even possible , marketing: Yeah , I thought I thought too project manager: but {disfmarker} marketing: but {disfmarker} project manager: 'cause it's {disfmarker} this requires a quite quite a bit of band-width . marketing: yeah . project manager: I don't think it's possible really . But the {disfmarker} they didn't really define in what should be used for . user interface: No . marketing: Maybe a T_V_ guide or something in your L_C_D_ uh {disfmarker} project manager: But I think in for example like T_V_ guides , I think that's {disfmarker} that th that you can transmit through it and everything . Just for extra information on your programmes . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Yeah . Yeah , it must be clear then what {disfmarker} what what for we use it . project manager: But also things like like like menus or p how about preferences of your {disfmarker} uh with configuring your remote control for favourite {disfmarker} your favourite channel for example , how do you configure that . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So that could be done by L_C_D_ display . I think it's good . No , maybe it's not a one because it's {disfmarker} we're not using it perfectly . We didn't give it {disfmarker} I don't thing over-discussing . Now we gave it enough thought though . I think we d should just lower this . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Maybe maybe it's a three though . We could've used it more effectively probably . marketing: Yeah , indeed . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: So everybody's agree with an uh three on it , project manager: Yeah , we are using it , user interface: Yeah . Two or three . industrial designer: Yes . marketing: it's {disfmarker} project manager: but it's not marketing: W project manager: it's not poorly used , but it's not efficiently used , I think . user interface: So {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: We could have ev even lost {vocalsound} the selection button and uh done everything via L_C_D_ selection . marketing: Yeah . project manager: It's {disfmarker} now it's just extra to illustrate im uh extra features , marketing: Yeah , {gap} I {disfmarker} project manager: but okay . marketing: A three . industrial designer: Nah , it's not really {disfmarker} only an extra . user interface: You can {disfmarker} seven . {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} industrial designer: No menus . marketing: Ah , nothing , that's {vocalsound} {disfmarker} A seven . Uh that's uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Think about {disfmarker} project manager: Can you talk to remote control ? user interface: Or we could say it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Well , it can't talk anymore . So we scrap that . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Or we could say neutral , project manager: Oh yeah {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: we {disfmarker} 'cause we scratched the {disfmarker} project manager: Just to be a prick , user interface: C project manager: but of course you can talk to your remote control , it doesn't do anything . marketing: {gap} Yeah yeah yeah yeah . project manager: But you c {vocalsound} you can talk to it . marketing: Not with the speech recognition . Uh yeah , all the trends and no colours uh anymore . So {disfmarker} project manager: Well , we did take everything into consideration of course . Uh the shape i shape is i marketing: Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} uh um only in the curves . project manager: I think we {disfmarker} yeah , I think that's okay . marketing: But the colours , we don't have special colours on it . user interface: No , we don't have the colour . project manager: Yeah , {gap} special co but we took into consideration the fact that it's customisable user interface: So I {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , project manager: to the fashi marketing: but we {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: Yes , but the end product {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: yeah , we don't have it , so d project manager: We don't have it {disfmarker} we do have it , marketing: In the end product . project manager: it's just sold as a package . industrial designer: But {disfmarker} M project manager: It does {disfmarker} it's not part of the basic product . industrial designer: Changing covers is also trend that we followed . project manager: It {disfmarker} that that's what I call trendy . I mean the shape is trendy . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: The the sh the the functions are trendy . It's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model . Because you ha marketing: Now {disfmarker} project manager: it's just not affordable at the moment . user interface: Maybe we should go with a two then , marketing: But it's not a one . user interface: because it's not perfect , because we can't do it initially , marketing: Yeah . user interface: but we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: It's possible , industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: Oh . {vocalsound} project manager: but you have to pay extra for the for the possibility of having it in a f a different colour . marketing: Oh well {disfmarker} Oops . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Oh it's a two , user interface: Yeah . marketing: right ? industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: On the last one . Uh that n that's all . project manager: Overall score . {vocalsound} user interface: Overall score . marketing: Overall . {vocalsound} It's um project manager: One two three . {gap} sixteen . marketing: {vocalsound} ten , sixteen three {disfmarker} uh two project manager: {vocalsound} Two two point some two point something . marketing: two point seven or something like that . industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: I don't know why . user interface: Ten , sixteen , divided by {disfmarker} project manager: {gap} . industrial designer: Six . marketing: Six . user interface: Is two two third . project manager: Two and two thirds . marketing: Um {disfmarker} So project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: we can say it's it's {disfmarker} the product is {disfmarker} it's okay . project manager: It's okay , but {vocalsound} that's yo m marketing: Y not {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition . user interface: There's {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: 'Cause yeah , that gives you a seven , which ruins your your average . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Without that it would be like under {disfmarker} it wouldn't {disfmarker} yeah , it would be under two . So I think we have {disfmarker} even with this it's reasonable . marketing: Woah . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , if we make it into a four , as in neutral , because we didn't implement it , so we can't say that we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that it's really not well implemented . We come out on a average of two one eighth . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Well I think it's {disfmarker} two is okay . user interface: So which is pretty w good . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yeah , two is pretty good . user interface: It's at least on the positive side . project manager: Definitely . user interface: So {disfmarker} We could definitely have done better if we've had more resources , industrial designer: Hmm , of course . marketing: Yeah . user interface: but {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , I think it's probably {disfmarker} {gap} I industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: Yeah . project manager: I do admit that we d {vocalsound} did miss a little {disfmarker} or didn't sp didn't talk {gap} {disfmarker} talk enough about the possibility of the L_C_D_ display . We could have used it more efficiently , marketing: Yeah . project manager: we just didn't think of it that way . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , with {gap} . ..# user interface: True . project manager: So {gap} {disfmarker} like I said , {vocalsound} changing channels , everything hidden in your L_C_D_ display , so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything . marketing: The scale . industrial designer: But I think for this price , this is {disfmarker} it's really a reasonable product . project manager: I think we div I think we did very well , industrial designer: It's a good product . project manager: uh ev even if you look at this score , we did quite well . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Oh . Oh . Yeah . marketing: With an L_C_D_ screen {gap} . project manager: It just looking for improvements what what you could have improved . So . {disfmarker} industrial designer: But if pep people really want speech recognition , then they must be prepared to pu to pay more , because it's cannot be done for this . project manager: {vocalsound} They sh they should get kids , and just stick 'em in T_V_ and say change the channel . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: you can make 'em another one . industrial designer: Hmm yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Ah but for this price uh you cannot ask that . project manager: I don' think so . Uh it's just not {disfmarker} it it's not affordable . industrial designer: You cannot th think of that {gap} {disfmarker} project manager: Or your sh you should lose the L_C_D_ screen probably , industrial designer: No , it's not . project manager: but I think that's {disfmarker} I think the L_C_D_ screen is more worth than speech recognition . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . Oh It's also more attractive . project manager: Definitely . Okay , that was that . marketing: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: So that's the final product without the speakers , I guess . user interface: So did you {disfmarker} project manager: Let's see , what was left in the the {disfmarker} Another one . {vocalsound} Hmm . {vocalsound} Yeah , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: we evaluate the product . {gap} {disfmarker} General project , what's i in {disfmarker} For example , I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created . We took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example , which I thought was pretty creative , because it was never never ever listed somewhere . industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: Favourite channel . project manager: Well {disfmarker} Anyways . Yeah , leadership is up to you . I mean perhaps I screwed up because I d {vocalsound} put a put a speech recognition into it . But that's not for me to decide . marketing: Yeah , I know . Yeah . project manager: I think we did pretty well as team-work though . Because , yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime , industrial designer: Yes . Hmm . project manager: because when I got the when I got the input for the financial results , initially of course I wanted to contact you . industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: Yeah , you're working separate . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Say , look , this is {disfmarker} you're doing the wrong thing , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Huh . project manager: you're s you're wasting your time now , because we're implementing stuff that we cannot afford . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: Yeah , yeah yeah . project manager: So it would be better if y if there was more communication between uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: Yeah yeah yeah . Direct uh communication with {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: because that's that's what would w you {disfmarker} what you would normally do , either call or email someone . user interface: And we could share information which we received . project manager: So that was too bad industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: con was impossible here anyways . {gap} . industrial designer: That's the same thing that I had in the beginning . Everybody was using materials that s I didn't have . project manager: It didn't have industrial designer: So {disfmarker} project manager: or didn't knew what they costs or whatever . marketing: Yeah . project manager: There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them . industrial designer: Oh . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: So that was a little unclear I suppose . I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool . I think uh s especially for design issues , it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little {disfmarker} it's easier to share them . marketing: {vocalsound} My handwriting is little bit {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah . user interface: Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher , industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: It's a little less {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} the response time is le it's very bad . user interface: because {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: It's good to visualise everything , but I think the response time should {disfmarker} could be a lot better . user interface: The digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to further elaborate on that . marketing: But th that's {disfmarker} project manager: Definitely . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yeah , it's true . marketing: Yeah , okay . user interface: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: But there's uh also one problem with this I noticed . Uh you have to finish a page before going to a n project manager: No , you don't have to . No , you don't . marketing: No . project manager: I jin I didn't check the finish button . industrial designer: Oh . marketing: You can {disfmarker} project manager: I just {disfmarker} you just ditch it and you can copy it or whatever . marketing: Done and then it's okay . industrial designer: Okay , I saw that uh {disfmarker} project manager: Uh only if you uh check the notes or {vocalsound} press done . Then it um {disfmarker} then you can {disfmarker} then it exports to Word automatically . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: But it's not necessary to check either one of those two . industrial designer: Yeah , project manager: You can just preview your p you can just preview your page in the in the programme . industrial designer: but I made {disfmarker} marketing: Oh , okay . industrial designer: Okay , but I made three pages marketing: Okay , yeah . industrial designer: and they were not finished . And when the third one was finished , I wanted to download it and then it was not possible anymore , because you have to close all the pinnits uh the pages before going further . {gap} {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , before starting a ne a new page . marketing: Okay . project manager: Okay , that could be b . industrial designer: Exactly . So we cannot work on more than one page at same time . That's not possible . marketing: Oh . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: You have to finish it completely , marketing: Hmm . user interface: Oh can you ? Okay . industrial designer: then download it , it's {disfmarker} then start a new one . project manager: Yeah , okay . industrial designer: That's not very uh handy , project manager: That's {disfmarker} industrial designer: but if you know that , then it's not a problem . project manager: Yeah , it's understandable , okay . {vocalsound} Any new ideas ? Yeah , more communication between {vocalsound} between uh {disfmarker} that's the thing I noticed , that communication is very um very important , industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Important to mm {disfmarker} project manager: because if you get new information , it's essential f for the other team-mates to know that as soon as possible , because you would avoid making {disfmarker} doing extra work , because you were doing extra work now uh m working on the on the speech recognition , you have limitation both on the technical {gap} {disfmarker} on the d on the design side . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So I think that could have been better . But that's {disfmarker} I think it's more of a a setting here that you cannot communicate than uh {gap} than somewhere else . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: So {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , well it could also possibly be {disfmarker} well , is it a more real-time information base , so we can all see {vocalsound} which information is available to one another . project manager: Yeah , I think so . And l less p less spam probably . I'm not sure i I'm not sure you got spammed as well , industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: but I get spammed like every t every two minutes there was a {disfmarker} there was another email about master classes or something . industrial designer: Ah . Well {disfmarker} project manager: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: which were totally useless actually . I thought I should probably look into them , {vocalsound} but they were all useless . So I just {disfmarker} user interface: Well , I personally did not have that , marketing: Mm {disfmarker} project manager: Oh okay . user interface: but {disfmarker} That's probably your l description . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: But I also didn't {disfmarker} not really . But still , you had that as well . Is that we finished up the design industrial designer: Huh . user interface: and then we checked the website , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: and then there was just extra information . marketing: Yeah , after {disfmarker} After five minutes , uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {gap} . user interface: There was a little delay in the {disfmarker} {gap} bit of a c crucial delay . industrial designer: Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: I didn't have any uh more information , it's just always the same here . So that's that's kind of a {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Email uh {disfmarker} project manager: It would change , but not for me . So I'd {disfmarker} I had no extra information to go on that one than what you give me actually . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: I couldn't do any research myself industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: or {disfmarker} I see , that's {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: yeah , w I could have done a little extra work probably , then {disfmarker} marketing: {gap} it's {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} But I was busy enough anyway . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Any new ideas found ? Or is that a {gap} 'cause {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh yeah , it's {disfmarker} well , industrial designer: No . project manager: probably is . user interface: How much time do we have for this anyway ? project manager: I have no clue . That's like {disfmarker} oh,but it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Should i industrial designer: {gap} . project manager: if the project is evaluated and it was it was in b within budget , we should celebrate . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay , marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: bring out the beer . user interface: Champagne . project manager: Uh okay , think that's about it . Uh {disfmarker} marketing: I want one for my own . {vocalsound} project manager: I'm not sure what we should still do though uh t let's see what {disfmarker} all your tasks were finished , right ? What you ha from your assistant . So let's {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: I have no more email . My coach is uh being very silent now . project manager: Okay , marketing: Yeah , project manager: I should {disfmarker} I think I sh marketing: my personal coach i project manager: I still have the the total report to finish up . I think we took very little time now , because {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , we're in agreement , everything {disfmarker} the design is okay . The one thing we missed though , we don't have a product name . marketing: What {disfmarker} industrial designer: No , project manager: How about you cook a {disfmarker} how about you cook up a product name ? user interface: Product name . industrial designer: we haven't think above {disfmarker} about that . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , name . industrial designer: Huh . It's better than thi I think than a serial number . Sony uh T_R_ something uh f means nothing to me . Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Just {disfmarker} marketing: Or fruit name . project manager: oh , think of a catchy name . I'll be working on this until the beep {disfmarker} until it beeps . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Like fruit names . marketing: Fruit name or something like that . project manager: What ? Fruit ? marketing: The banana remote or something . project manager: You don't want it to resemble a banana . marketing: {vocalsound} I don't know . Yeah , it's the form of it . project manager: It's not yellow anyway . user interface: The bana 'cause it's not yellow anymore . project manager: It's not yellow anymore . marketing: Yeah {disfmarker} oh , yeah . {gap} {disfmarker} project manager: It is curved , but {disfmarker} marketing: Uh yeah . {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} user interface: Well , uh I was going for the R_C_ deluxe , but it's not really a catchy name or anything , project manager: No , user interface: it's more {disfmarker} project manager: it's {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Uh at least it's not something with numbers . project manager: Hmm . industrial designer: Numbers are so meaningless to the people . I mean {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: Something with our {gap} company name , marketing: That's true . user interface: can we do anything with that ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} . user interface: Maybe there's something on the website which will help us out . marketing: Reaction , Real Reaction . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Real Reaction . user interface: The reaction deluxe . project manager: Real Reaction future R_C_ . {vocalsound} Step into the future of of remote controlling your T_V_ . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Is that a name or a c campaign ? {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: No that's a that's a catchy slogan . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Control your remote control . user interface: Or the {disfmarker} The real reactor . industrial designer: Real react . project manager: I go for future R_C_ probably . Something like {disfmarker} It's short f industrial designer: The Real Reactor , I don't find that uh that bad at all . marketing: {gap} . project manager: Real reactor ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Uh that that's user interface: You should write it down as a {disfmarker} an option . industrial designer: Because our name is Real Reaction . project manager: That makes me think of different {vocalsound} products than a remote control really . marketing: {vocalsound} {gap} . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: I'm not sure . Real reaction in a real {disfmarker} marketing: Zapping . The {disfmarker} user interface: So that's one option . project manager: Real reactor . Didn't notice . industrial designer: I'm looking for things in the name . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: So that the first three letters are s the same . R_E_A_ R_E_A_ . user interface: Should I write the banana down or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: I take f marketing: Yeah , sure . project manager: yeah , take a banana . user interface: Sure ? marketing: {vocalsound} The banana . project manager: Hmm . marketing: Remote . Banana recei R_C_ . industrial designer: The triple R_ . Real Reaction remotes control . Triple R_ . marketing: Remote . user interface: Well I {disfmarker} marketing: R_ three C_ . user interface: Uh do you mean it like {disfmarker} industrial designer: {gap} ? marketing: R_ three C_ . industrial designer: {gap} yeah . user interface: You mean it like this ? industrial designer: Yeah , that {disfmarker} marketing: Real Reaction Remote Control . R_ three C_ . Oh yeah . industrial designer: {gap} . {gap} . project manager: No , not like that . It should be it should be longer , because it's not a product name that you f print on a box . industrial designer: I think {disfmarker} triple R_ . project manager: Just write out triple , like a word triple R_C_ , triple stripe {disfmarker} Oh . Triple dash R_ dash s s C_ . industrial designer: Doesn't sound {gap} ? marketing: Yeah , triple R_ . industrial designer: Yeah . Ah . marketing: Triple R_C_ . The triple R_C_ , yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: R_ s R_ three C_ . {gap} . project manager: {vocalsound} R_ dash C_ . user interface: Dash C_ ? industrial designer: I think I like it like this more . project manager: Dash . Triple R_ or triple R_C_ ? user interface: Like a C_ right now or a dash in a C_ ? marketing: Triple R_ dash . project manager: How about do both ? user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Sure if it looks stupid . Uh I think that the the R_C_ together takes away the the the image of {disfmarker} it's a triple {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: Uh the first the first one looks like it's a triple remote control , industrial designer: Mm . marketing: That {disfmarker} project manager: but it's only a single remote control . And it's especially on the triple R_ that's important . The Real Reaction Remote . industrial designer: I would {disfmarker} huh . I would lose the C_ marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , this {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: and just name it triple R_ . user interface: Is it triple R_C_s ? No . project manager: {gap} {disfmarker} industrial designer: It sounds like uh thinking about two different things and combining it . marketing: Triple remote . industrial designer: I would just say triple R_s triple R_ marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , triple R_ {gap} yeah , you can {disfmarker} user interface: Well , that's another option . industrial designer: That's also short , catchy . marketing: It's okay . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , triple R_ . user interface: Okay , so which ones are we going to scratch definitely ? marketing: {vocalsound} The banana . {vocalsound} Banana . {vocalsound} project manager: Banana remote . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Banana . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} I say this one as well . marketing: Yeah , the deluxe . project manager: I think we're all in agreement about the triple R_ . industrial designer: {gap} . project manager: I think triple R_ is cool . industrial designer: Yes . user interface: Triple R_ ? marketing: The r triple R_ . project manager: And it looks cool when you print it in font , looks pretty cool . user interface: Triple R_ it is . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {gap} did you do now ? project manager: Just like this {gap} just {disfmarker} and you just print triple R_ , it looks {disfmarker} doesn't look bad , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: it's short , it's okay . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So have to write my report now , I guess . Um {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Yeah , so we have everything . We have the product , we have the costs , industrial designer: Yep . project manager: we have the possibility of everything . marketing: It can't work . That will not {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . I think it's adjourned . Retire to my lair and finish the report . That was a short meeting . But efficient though . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . The boss is always the last one to go home . So {disfmarker} project manager: Probably . See . Okay , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: goodbye . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: See you in a minute . marketing: Damn . I will write that one in a Word uh document . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report ? user interface: Yeah , sure . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Can't we take this one ? marketing: Oh sh industrial designer: Otherwise we have to do it all over again . marketing: Um {disfmarker} user interface: I don't really know whether we can save it as a picture or no . industrial designer: Is it okay if I try ? Is that okay with you ? user interface: Sure . marketing: Yeah , okay , I will ask you when uh I need the information . industrial designer: I'll put it back in a minute . marketing: So it's {disfmarker} oh . industrial designer: Okay , it has been saving something , but where to I don't know . marketing: Uh {disfmarker} Oh . Merge . industrial designer: Oh , can I say exp yes , I can . marketing: Sucks . industrial designer: Export as J_ PEG . {gap} . Okay , can I not put this wherever I wants . My document is the wrong one , huh . marketing: {gap} {disfmarker} Yeah , but {disfmarker} user interface: Network places . marketing: I don't know . Smart {disfmarker} no . industrial designer: {gap} . marketing: Ma it's maybe it's not on the network of uh the rest . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I don't think so . marketing: That one is . {gap} . user interface: I wouldn't pick that one , no . industrial designer: Document and settings . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: That's a pity . That means that we have to gonna draw it again . Are you gonna do that ? user interface: Sure . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Oh . industrial designer: That {disfmarker} Yes . Okay . Okay . Okay . Yes , that's correct . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: No . Oh , it's export . marketing: Oh yeah , {gap} . {gap} {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Can I see scores ? industrial designer: Oh , of course . marketing: Uh , {gap} one one , two threes , two {disfmarker} industrial designer: Sorry . marketing: Okay , then we'll {disfmarker} overall , two points . Yes . user interface: I see you later . marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Mm .
