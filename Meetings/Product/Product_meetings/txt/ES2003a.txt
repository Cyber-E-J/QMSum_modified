project manager: Okay , well I think we're ready to begin . Right , my name's Adam Duguid , we're here because of real reaction , um , we have in the group marketing: Oh , Ebenezer Ademesoye . Would you like me to spell that ? project manager: Um , yeah , marketing: S project manager: go for it mate . marketing: Um , N_E_Z_ project manager: N_ E_ Z_ . marketing: E_R_ . project manager: Ebenezer . And your role is ? marketing: I'm the Marketing Expert . project manager: You're the Marketing Expert , okay . Next we have ? industrial designer: Tarik Rahman . T_A_R_I_K_ . project manager: T_ R_ I_ K_ . And your role in this is ? industrial designer: Industrial Designer . project manager: Industrial Designer . And , lastly we have ? user interface: Uh , Dave Cochrane . project manager: And you're going to be the User Interface , user interface: User Interface Defin Designer , yes . project manager: is it ? Designer . Okay . Right . This is the agenda for today's meeting . As you can see , w opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . Um , we already got n through opening , and partially through acquaintance . So , the reason we're here , we're gonna design a new remote control , as you probably all know . The very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . Course , we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that , but uh {vocalsound} personally I think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design . Um , there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . This is how today seems to be going to work . We're gonna have the three kay phases , as you've probably already been told , the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . Um {disfmarker} First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design . Second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far . Of course , you've all got the similar emails , I believe , right . {vocalsound} What can I say ? Ebenezer , you wanna have a {disfmarker} you wanna draw your favourite animal {vocalsound} ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Sure . {vocalsound} Whiteboard . 'Kay . S okay . I will make this quick , since we don't have much time . {vocalsound} Um . {vocalsound} 'Kay , so it's not the best picture in the world . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Here we have an elephant . First point , begins with an E_ , same like Ebenezer . Also , elephants have a very good memory , much like myself , industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: and I can't remember back when I used to live back in Nigeria , but I think I used to have a pet elephant . So elephants are big , strong and gentle , and they have great memories , and they begin with the letter E_ , just like Ebenezer . project manager: Brilliantly done . Thank you . {vocalsound} marketing: Thank you . project manager: Tarik , would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry ? industrial designer: {gap} . project manager: Oh , um , marketing: Oh . Oh {vocalsound} oh project manager: you can clip them to your belt . industrial designer: Do we take them off ? marketing: I think you ga industrial designer: Oh right , project manager: You should also l um have your {disfmarker} the lapel mic on as well . industrial designer: okay . marketing: The little {disfmarker} The the {disfmarker} industrial designer: Ah-ha . marketing: Oh that's good , we can clip them on . Okay . Yeah , industrial designer: {vocalsound} Now where do I put the {disfmarker} marketing: Just um somewhere {disfmarker} project manager: Yep , the {gap} , it's just across there , that's it . Yep . industrial designer: Is this supposed to be clipped as well ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: I think so . project manager: It'll follow you if you {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . There you go . project manager: You can probably just stick it in your pocket for now , I wouldn't worry too much . Should have good range . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Uh , destroying your elephant here . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh , here we have a tiger . Uh {disfmarker} I've always loved tigers . They're just {disfmarker} they're big , they're biggest cats , uh I did a project on cats in the wild when I was a kid and uh it was my favourite cat , just 'cause it was {disfmarker} looks the best , the stripes , orange . My dad used to talk about {disfmarker} he's from Bangladesh so he used to tell me all about them when he was {disfmarker} when I was a kid . And uh they're just the most feared of of uh animals in the wild . So uh that's why I like them . Didn't say an anything about me really but {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Excellent , thank you very much . Dave , if you'd like to uh have a dash . user interface: Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um , the monkey , um . The one f uh {disfmarker} in fact this is a {gap} somewhat oblique reference in fact to uh {disfmarker} well my {disfmarker} I have a three uh three y year old daughter who h who who who is affectionately known as Miss Monkey . Um , monkeys have attitude . Which I think is a good thing . And I mean fr {vocalsound} and from uh from the point of view of sort of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting . Um , so I like monkeys . And and th th th th thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Cheers . Hardly what I'd call the best drawing in the world but it'll do for now . Also not quite as feared as your average tiger , but uh cats are one of my favourite animals , they're very independent , they're snotty as hell at the best of times , and uh , what can you say , you got to love those qualities in an animal . Right . I think we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it , so , on to it . Project finance . As you can see , twelve point five Euros per unit . That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware , and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five . If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them . marketing: Oh , that was profiting , that was an amount , so that's the amount made , project manager: Yep . marketing: okay . project manager: Well , fifty million , and if you're making twelve point five Euros on each one , then , awful lot need to be sold . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay . Now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project . So I'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls . Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ? user interface: Well , one thing I'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , so you get the sort of you get um you {vocalsound} you can redesign the interface to your own needs , you can programme in macros , and you get a much greater degree um um I mean you get in these sort of {vocalsound} three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control , to a much greater extent , and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the T_V_ to the right channel , get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the V_C_R_ and get it to play once it's rewound , for instance . project manager: Okay . user interface: Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket . project manager: Okay , yeah , tha that's true , with the price range we're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our {disfmarker} user interface: Absolutely prohibitive , project manager: yeah . user interface: yeah . marketing: Oh . project manager: But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion . user interface: Yeah , I mean I wouldn't like to say you g {vocalsound} I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion . Some {gap} and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for {vocalsound} um running macros . project manager: Would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the T_V_ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of {disfmarker} user interface: For instance , um let's say oh oh um , or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well , um project manager: Okay , that sounds like a a good strong idea . Um {disfmarker} marketing: 'Kay project manager: {vocalsound} Any takes on this ? marketing: Well um I've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television , um when I was younger we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers , user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , and {vocalsound} the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , um keypad , for playing games . project manager: Okay . marketing: So perhaps one that was more um specialised for game playing or interactive television . They they've recently brought out this new remote control , for people to set their favourite channels , or um to record things . Instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins , project manager: Okay . marketing: and slide another bar to say what time it ends , you know that's {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah I've heard {disfmarker} I've seen the bar-code design before , industrial designer: Mm . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: yeah . marketing: Yeah , it's it's taken out the {disfmarker} Y you don't have to be uh really clever to use a remote control . I think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Uh , you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television , so you need buttons to change the television angle , the camera angles and stuff like that . project manager: Okay , well industrial designer: 'Kay . project manager: we're beginning to run out of time now , so , we've got a couple of ideas , marketing: Yeah . project manager: we can {disfmarker} we'll have to work fast , um , alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting , so {vocalsound} we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , um , how the user interface might work , that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility because you have to program it , you have to have a lot of response back , or at least some kind . Um {disfmarker} user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: And we're gonna maybe n try and have to figure out marketing: What the user wants uh . project manager: what the user wants , yes . marketing: Okay . project manager: Um , right . Has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage , anything they think that might have been missed so far ? industrial designer: Well when you're talking about gaming and stuff , do you think they should have some sort of stick on it , rather than buttons ? marketing: Oh . Okay , {gap} . industrial designer: Like uh control pads , you know of games , but {disfmarker} marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: or is that a bit ridiculous ? {vocalsound} project manager: I I don't see why not , almost everybody is probably used to a console by now , and all of them incorporate small keypads on them , in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well , so it's probably an interface that most people are used to . Um industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well . user interface: Mm-hmm . The other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic , something that just fits {vocalsound} fits as comfortably as possible into the hand . But of course , uh al al also allows for {gap} the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive uh sha shape for it overall , {vocalsound} . project manager: Okay . So , user interface: A curve , project manager: small , stylish , and something that's just a little different . user interface: mm-hmm . Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form , {vocalsound} uh which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway . project manager: Okay . That's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily . I would I would have hoped so anyway . Um , right . I'd say we finish this one up , we get started , I'll get in , I'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done , and I'll get that out to everybody . Yeah ? marketing: 'Kay . So . project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} . industrial designer: {gap} . project manager: Um , as far as I'm aware we leave the microphones here , um unless we get told otherwise , and just take the laptops with us .
