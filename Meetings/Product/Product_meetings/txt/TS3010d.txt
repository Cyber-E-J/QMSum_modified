project manager: Okay . So , now um , {vocalsound} last time . Can you uh {vocalsound} push the button ? {vocalsound} One time please . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm still the secretary . Now uh , I ask you to presentate the prototype . One of your {disfmarker} you two . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I don't care . {vocalsound} user interface: Oh this , you mean ? project manager: Yes . The prototype . industrial designer: Huh ? user interface: Yes , well uh this is it . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} This is it . project manager: Well , thank you . Uh , now {disfmarker} user interface: It's uh it's uh it's yellow . And uh , this is rubber . And and and this too . The project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: the sides . project manager: Yes . user interface: And the rest is hard plastic . And uh {disfmarker} We uh we had some uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} We had a new idea {vocalsound} that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: And then it covers the {disfmarker} these buttons project manager: Okay . user interface: until here or something . marketing: Yes . user interface: And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: So , you can still operate uh all the things . Because you don't always use the menu . And then it can break . project manager: Okay . And the buttons ? user interface: Uh , well uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Big . {vocalsound} user interface: Big buttons . And everything is blue , except the power button . And the mute . Of uh {disfmarker} yeah , and the mute and the the other button . {vocalsound} Yeah . Channel higher channel button . industrial designer: {gap} . marketing: Yeah . project manager: And the joystick is for the volume and the channels . user interface: Uh , yes . Yes , industrial designer: Yes . user interface: that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Very obvious . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Up is channel up . Down is channel down . To the right is volume up . To the left is volume down . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ . What's the R_R_ {gap} d {vocalsound} user interface: R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo . industrial designer: The R_R_ ? project manager: Okay . Very good . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: So , we have {disfmarker} marketing: That's on the rub rubber part . user interface: Uh , yes . Yes . That's about here . project manager: So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good . user interface: Oh . project manager: So , that's it . That's prototype . marketing: Yeah ? project manager: Now , the finance . {vocalsound} We don't know if it's {disfmarker} th it {disfmarker} if it's okay . marketing: Alright . {vocalsound} project manager: So , I'm gonna look . marketing: Do we {disfmarker} project manager: We have {disfmarker} marketing: Do we change the {disfmarker} project manager: Sorry ? marketing: Do we change the the order ? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ? project manager: Finance is um {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker} No , first uh {disfmarker} Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet . marketing: Okay . project manager: Sorry . marketing: That's uh um {disfmarker} {gap} That can be none . Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up . Uh-oh . Okay . Um , yeah . Well , we uh {disfmarker} uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh {disfmarker} Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . {vocalsound} So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . Yeah . Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Criteria . marketing: You {disfmarker} {gap} So we open up that blank here . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Think I can {disfmarker} Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can get a number in here . Hmm . project manager: No , it's okay . marketing: Well , uh we can't do that . industrial designer: I'll get it . project manager: Oh , it's okay . marketing: Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . The first uh on each item . project manager: What do you think ? marketing: Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh {disfmarker} it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ . So , it {disfmarker} Um , I think I will give it a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , yeah {gap} , a four . Hmm . industrial designer: I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . What uh {disfmarker} not anoth uh , marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: not a lot of uh {disfmarker} a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an seven . Si six six . project manager: {gap} Yeah . industrial designer: Sorry , six . marketing: So now i I think you uh see it {gap} um its statement . industrial designer: Oh , true or false . marketing: And you {gap} true or false . industrial designer: Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two . marketing: And true is one . So , yeah . Yeah . project manager: Two . industrial designer: Sorry . project manager: You ? user interface: Three . project manager: Me too . So it's a three . marketing: 'Kay . Um , well {disfmarker} It's a one . {vocalsound} The first item . So , okay the second item . Um , this product is for all sorts of customers . user interface: Mm {disfmarker} marketing: Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . It doesn't look like that . project manager: So it's a {disfmarker} marketing: That's uh a six . industrial designer: Five . user interface: Mm , four . project manager: Yes , it's for the younger g group . So it's uh half half of the people . user interface: Yeah , but it's it's {disfmarker} project manager: So I think it's four . user interface: Yeah . I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons . project manager: No . user interface: So {disfmarker} I mean , the colours are for young people , industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: but project manager: Yes . So , I think it's four . user interface: older {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Maybe version uh three point O_ uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} has other colours . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe . project manager: Okay . Give it a four . industrial designer: Four . project manager: Yep . marketing: Four . Uh , okay . Mm . project manager: We put the fashion in electronics . marketing: That's uh the motto of our company . Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ? I um {disfmarker} Yeah . I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . Um , so I would give it a two . industrial designer: Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard . But the rest of it is . So , I think a two . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yes . Two . project manager: Uh , I say uh a five . marketing: Two . project manager: It's not fashion , it's new . It must be a fashion . But it isn't . industrial designer: It {disfmarker} it will be fashion . project manager: Yes . It w If it's not a fashion we can put it in it . So , it must be a fashion . I think it's a five . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . user interface: Then make it th three . marketing: Okay . Yes , I'll think of that too . project manager: No . Oh . industrial designer: 'Kay . Three is okay . marketing: Yeah , agree ? project manager: I use my feet though . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Oh , we'll wait outside . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} A three . project manager: Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: The next element um is the product looks good . Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . So , I would give this a five . industrial designer: I give it a one . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {gap} . Yes , a one . I like it . project manager: Well , I say three . So , counting then is two and a half . {vocalsound} marketing: We have to do our uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Say two . marketing: Two or three ? project manager: Okay , two . industrial designer: Two . marketing: Two . Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: So , well we gonna do the next part . Uh , yep . Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . Um , yeah , I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . And in the end we calculate an average . So , um that's why it's a negative in it . Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . So , um uh did we uh do that ? Well , uh if we go to {vocalsound} uh this fashion , I {disfmarker} We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers . But you can you can go for that . And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two . industrial designer: One . project manager: {vocalsound} You ? user interface: One . {vocalsound} project manager: Me too . One . marketing: One . {vocalsound} Um , but {vocalsound} where where is the {gap} ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Next , six . It does not get lost easily . marketing: So {disfmarker} Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Yes . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Just a small thing . {vocalsound} project manager: No , we did not . So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ? user interface: Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah . industrial designer: Ah . Yellow . project manager: I don't think so . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Looks like a pistol . project manager: Yes . Not a not a normal shapes . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh {disfmarker} It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch . project manager: No . It won't get lost . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh {disfmarker} marketing: It won't . project manager: A one ? {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , o one . project manager: Okay , a one . marketing: One . project manager: Next . marketing: Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market . project manager: {gap} marketing: Uh yeah , did we achieve that . I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two . project manager: Yeah me {disfmarker} {gap} industrial designer: Yeah . Me too . project manager: That was our target . Two . industrial designer: Two . project manager: Yep . industrial designer: Yeah ? Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Right . There's a fancy look-and-feel . marketing: Uh , yes . That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . I didn't uh say it in my presentation . But um , well does it have that ? I would say yes . So um {disfmarker} Well , let's also give this a two . T industrial designer: I gave this a one because of the rubber . It feels soft . Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . It's {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , f very fancy {gap} trendy . project manager: Okay . user interface: Yes , a one . project manager: I say a two . It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: So I think s two is better . user interface: Yeah , okay . industrial designer: Two is okay . marketing: Okay . Two . industrial designer: {gap} . marketing: And um , then the last one I could think of , uh it goes with the latest trends . project manager: No , it's new . Innovation . marketing: If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food but we didn't uh {disfmarker} We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . industrial designer: Oh . marketing: So , I would {disfmarker} did not give this uh a one or two . I {disfmarker} We'll go for a three . project manager: {gap} . industrial designer: I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . Uh , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like uh I said in my presentation . Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yes . industrial designer: But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . Something what also younger people want . It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two . project manager: Okay . user interface: Mm , three . project manager: Me too . Three . marketing: A three . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Okay . So um , come back to the presentation now . So , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating . project manager: Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty , {gap} . marketing: So , we will do that . Yes . project manager: Twenty one . So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third . marketing: By nine . industrial designer: Two . marketing: Yeah . Um , uh okay . {vocalsound} Two . project manager: Yep . marketing: Come on . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh , nah . Okay . marketing: So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think . user interface: {vocalsound} Yes . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: So , it's good . marketing: So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Thank you . industrial designer: Yeah , I think {gap} . marketing: Oh . Nah . How am I doing ? Yes . project manager: Okay . marketing: And I closed your slide-show . project manager: Back to my uh {disfmarker} marketing: Which one was the last for you ? Uh , dreaming . project manager: Yep . Next please . marketing: Next . Finance . project manager: So , now uh we have a product . Very happy . But uh , is it cheap enough ? Um , so if uh {disfmarker} I'll have a look . We have a battery . One battery . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Cheapest there is . project manager: Okay , one battery . Electronics . Advanced chip . industrial designer: Expensive . project manager: Yeah it's the most advanced . Chip-on-print . We have that one . industrial designer: Well , it's the most advanced . project manager: We have the simple , regular and advanced . industrial designer: Advanced . project manager: We have the adva advanced . 'Kay , so uncurved or flat . Nope . Single curved or double curved ? We have double curved . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Then we have plastic , wood , rubber . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} we have half rubber , half plastic . user interface: Mm , yes . project manager: No titanium . Special colour . Yes , yellow . industrial designer: Uh , yellow . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . user interface: Mm , yeah . project manager: Interface , push-button . Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: So , we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ? industrial designer: One . marketing: One . project manager: And it's not really a s industrial designer: Joystick uh thing . marketing: {gap} . project manager: Yeah , it's this one . Now , uh button supplement . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Special colour . We already {disfmarker} Uh , that's the {disfmarker} from the {disfmarker} for the buttons . The buttons are regular colour . user interface: Mm , yeah . project manager: So , then uh {disfmarker} then then then then then then {disfmarker} Then {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} We're not gonna make it . {vocalsound} project manager: Uh , no . It's too expensive . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} Wh project manager: So , we have to change something . industrial designer: What what are the costs ? project manager: Fifteen Euros . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Fifteen . project manager: Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 'Cause we can't lose the battery . We can't lose the advanced chip . We can't lose the double curve . We have rubber , special colour . marketing: {gap} . We would have uh n industrial designer: A special colour . project manager: Oh , no , we {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour . project manager: No , it's uh {disfmarker} Sorry ? industrial designer: Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ? marketing: For a remote control . industrial designer: {vocalsound} What ? marketing: I've {disfmarker} For a remote control , I think it is . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right . project manager: Um , then we uh lose two Euros . Then we have thirteen Euros . Half a Euro too much . Exactly the special colours . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: And what if we use only one sort of um {disfmarker} Um {vocalsound} just only plastic or only rubber ? project manager: That's one Euro . industrial designer: One Euro discount . {vocalsound} project manager: So , I don't think that's good . Mm {disfmarker} I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . If {disfmarker} industrial designer: If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left . project manager: Yes . Then it's only thirteen Euros . industrial designer: {vocalsound} And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ? project manager: So uh {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah . Then you have {disfmarker} Or you have to cut this off . industrial designer: Uh {disfmarker} uh-uh . project manager: Then it's not good anymore . industrial designer: No . project manager: So , wait . Okay . I'll have a look . {vocalsound} We {disfmarker} industrial designer: And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour {disfmarker} it's a normal colour , wh {vocalsound} project manager: Yellow rubber . industrial designer: No one will see it . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , normal . industrial designer: Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: And it's twelve Euros , I think . project manager: One minute , please . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Is it maximum . Um {disfmarker} Yeah , it's normal colour . But if you lose the joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ? industrial designer: No . Uh , no , no , no . project manager: Or it's then a regular ? industrial designer: Uh {disfmarker} Oh , wait wait wait . marketing: The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Oh yeah . project manager: So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick . industrial designer: Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . project manager: And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ? industrial designer: If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ . project manager: Yeah , regular chip . But {disfmarker} Is it a good design ? industrial designer: Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have the L_C_D_ . marketing: If uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: So , the T_V_s has to uh {disfmarker} have to be up-to-date . marketing: If we have the n no buttons {disfmarker} If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have {disfmarker} uh , we have thirteen Euros ? project manager: Mm , yes . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Then it's okay . industrial designer: Huh . No knew that . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we {disfmarker} then we get push-buttons from half a Euro . industrial designer: Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay . project manager: Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour , user interface: Okay . All the same uh {disfmarker} project manager: you have to pay point two Euros . industrial designer: So , all the buttons has to {disfmarker} have to be the same colour . project manager: Yes . industrial designer: But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ? user interface: Mm , yeah . Recognisable . Like what {disfmarker} industrial designer: Recognisable , yeah . project manager: Yes . user interface: Yeah . Mm , yeah . project manager: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah ? user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: {gap} So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Now we have to change that , but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ? user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Oh , well that's clear . project manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} And {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Where's {gap} ? Yeah . So , now it's {disfmarker} industrial designer: And the joystick away . And its buttons . project manager: Yeah . It is . But then it will be just that ones . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Now it's {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} still , he waited at the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Very good . marketing: No . project manager: Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well {disfmarker} What do you think of it ? Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: About the project manager: About the project . marketing: Project . industrial designer: process . Went good . Uh {disfmarker} I think uh the creativity uh {vocalsound} was good enough . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um {disfmarker} Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah that was clear . Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . And uh {disfmarker} no , uh o only the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found . {vocalsound} Nope . project manager: Okay . And you . user interface: Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh {disfmarker} Yeah , it uh {disfmarker} It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it . project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um {disfmarker} Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor {gap} and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion . project manager: Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions . industrial designer: {vocalsound} No . project manager: So , it's good for the speed . user interface: No . industrial designer: Yep . project manager: So , I think we're ready . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Good price . Evaluation ready . Ready . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Beer . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} That's it . industrial designer: Yeah ? Okay then . marketing: Okay . user interface: {gap} .
