project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: So we are here for the concept design meeting . So , we will first start by summarizing the mm {vocalsound} the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . Uh I will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours . We'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest {disfmarker} next task , to have {disfmarker} to be done before the next meeting . So , last time we decided to have a simple interface . We also decided to have a wheel to change channel {disfmarker} previous channel button . Channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple . We have also button for volume , and to switch on off the T_V_ . We have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features . So now uh we will have three presentations . So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer , the specification of the U_I_ by {disfmarker} or U_I_ {vocalsound} user interface: Abdul al-Hasred is my name . project manager: okay . {vocalsound} And uh the last point is uh trend watching by Market Expert . So maybe we can start with uh industrial design . So this is the presentation . industrial designer: Uh , I_D_ you want ? project manager: Maybe I can switch slide uh on your request . industrial designer: Yeah . I only v have three slides , so . I just look at the mm {disfmarker} um just this . On some web pages to find some documentation project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: and I think a remote control is , as I s mentioned previously , you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a um a wheel control . So uh uh I was looking basically for that chip , which is uh very very standard , and uh I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . And um {vocalsound} yeah we can change directly . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . The push button are usually extremely cheap , but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . project manager: Okay . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not {disfmarker} if if we could combine something with the push button . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button . user interface: Yeah . project manager: But is it a significant price on the whole remote control ? user interface: Mm . project manager: Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah project manager: So will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce ? industrial designer: I I th {vocalsound} But I don't think that uh we should {disfmarker} We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay user interface: Also have to say {disfmarker} industrial designer: But {disfmarker} user interface: Did you receive the email about the voice recognition ? industrial designer: Um that's all {vocalsound} user interface: No ? project manager: You received something {disfmarker} industrial designer: yeah . I haven't chec user interface: Yeah . You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed . project manager: Hmm . user interface: Says {disfmarker} Yeah . It says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions . But I guess it could be {disfmarker} project manager: And could it be adapted ? user interface: I guess it's possible . I mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command . project manager: Okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff ? user interface: Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , so if they already have it as uh as a chip project manager: Okay . Yeah . user interface: then we we could use it . project manager: Okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on {disfmarker} according to those news . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah but I think it's yeah {disfmarker} Sorry , I haven't written my personal references . Um {vocalsound} the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: and if we could reduce that . We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button . user interface: Mm-hmm . I have a question about that actually {vocalsound} . Um , what is the purpose of the light ? industrial designer: Just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber {disfmarker} user interface: Is {disfmarker} project manager: You can easily find the button in the dark or so ? user interface: But {disfmarker} But in th in the dark uh {disfmarker} Yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ? project manager: It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think , no ? user interface: But if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it . project manager: Hmm . user interface: You can see the buttons better , of course . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . True . industrial designer: Yeah . Actually . user interface: But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to {disfmarker} when you move it to detect your movement . industrial designer: As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light . user interface: Yeah , but you need another sensor for that , right ? industrial designer: Yeah . Again . user interface: Yeah {vocalsound} no it's too expensive . {vocalsound} industrial designer: I don't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . Mm . Extra . Yeah , okay . Mm . Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , industrial designer: {vocalsound} First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light user interface: yeah . industrial designer: and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . Mm-hmm . project manager: But it can be uh battery consuming , no ? To have the light always on ? industrial designer: Yeah , a little bit . A little bit . user interface: Mm . project manager: Well we will discuss that after maybe industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Okay project manager: the other presentations . user interface: . So uh my one , it uh should be in the shared folder . project manager: Yeah . user interface: So . It was last time I saw it . project manager: And it is . user interface: Okay . So , project manager: Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} just move to the next slide . {vocalsound} So basically {vocalsound} want very simple , right ? That's the major idea , as simple as possible . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: So I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Um . {vocalsound} So . project manager: And also does it uh fit well in hand ? Because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage . user interface: Yeah . Well this these uh these remotes are quite big , so go to the next page , so . We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle . project manager: Yeah {vocalsound} . Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: So , from the bottom or whatever is there , uh the uh the numbers and then the top , uh until the ten also , this middle part , project manager: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: and on the left one is exactly the same . So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , yeah ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: These are the basic thing . project manager: So it's only the central part . user interface: So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two . project manager: Yeah . With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part . user interface: Yeah , if you have , for example {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . project manager: Yeah . user interface: It could be on the right side , for example . project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah . Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have . And I think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because project manager: Okay . user interface: you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things . project manager: Okay . S user interface: Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way . project manager: Okay . Will be down or {disfmarker} user interface: So that they're separate a bit , project manager: Okay . user interface: yeah . Uh and it's easy to press the other {disfmarker} the big buttons , but uh , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either . Mm . Yeah , I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user . project manager: Okay . user interface: Alright , you won't {disfmarker} yeah . Usually what {disfmarker} I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that . project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah . That you want to protect a bit . And I think it's uh it's reasonable . project manager: Okay . user interface: So , I don't think {disfmarker} Yeah , this is just the the wheel . project manager: Mm . user interface: We could use the {disfmarker} some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case . project manager: Yeah . Maybe the wheel will be a {vocalsound} good advantage over our competitors . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple . So maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect . industrial designer: To s Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah , I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that . project manager: Okay . So we can move to the {disfmarker} Is there any question ? For designer of user interface ? {vocalsound} or we can move to the next part , maybe , and discuss afterwards ? Okay . marketing: Okay , I can go ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: Can I ? {vocalsound} So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um . So , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel . And um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative . project manager: Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} And the third most important aspect is to to {disfmarker} is that the co remote control should be easy to use . So , are things we are we have uh speak about before . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . And um {disfmarker} so you you can go {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . marketing: after . And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends , uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures . {vocalsound} So , maybe if our {vocalsound} remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . marketing: something like that , or {disfmarker} industrial designer: I support an apple . marketing: {vocalsound} And the mm the material is expected to be spongy . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh I don't know which material {vocalsound} can be spongy , project manager: Yeah . marketing: and if you {disfmarker} project manager: This is good also for {disfmarker} user interface: Well , wou wou I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: it it would work , right ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: I think it is good also f to have a spongy material , yeah . user interface: You can throw it to the television . project manager: Yeah , because it's robust . marketing: Okay {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . Me too . marketing: It's robust , yeah . user interface: Hey that's a cool one . We could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: When it d uh takes a shock . project manager: Yeah marketing: {vocalsound} Not good . project manager: uh sorry ? industrial designer: Ah it's okay . I know that they do that for alarm clock also . user interface: Yeah . marketing: An and and uh this uh you can yeah you can say that . You ca uh you can go uh before project manager: No . Yeah . Before ? marketing: , before , yes . And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is uh technological innovative , and after the easy to use . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah that's why {disfmarker} project manager: Has it ? marketing: Yeah that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible . project manager: Yeah . I think it's {disfmarker} it makes it both easy and both innos innovative . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: Innovative . Mm . project manager: So I think it's a good aspect and it should be kept . user interface: How do we make it look cool is the question . project manager: Cool , fancy ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: We have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Maybe uh um {vocalsound} a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that . industrial designer: What about um {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Mm . Oh , colour , yeah . user interface: Well the obvious thing is a banana , I guess . marketing: Oh {disfmarker} i i {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Maybe yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: I thought about a a pear , for example . You know the pear , is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand project manager: Yeah , and it's ergonomic as well . marketing: and uh {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: A pear . user interface: The banana is also ergonomic . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . Maybe pear yeah or something like that . marketing: Or a fruit like that . I dunno . project manager: Yeah . We can discuss that uh . D D Is is there anything you want to add ? user interface: Is there any fruit that is spongy ? marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} I don't think so . I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Something like that . industrial designer: And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice , with blue L_E_D_ inside ? project manager: But that's not in the trend . {vocalsound} . user interface: You can make it um {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: The trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: It's not hard , the metal . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Plastic . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yep . project manager: So , I think we can keep the wheel because it's uh easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana wit uh any others idea you have . What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your T_V_ with ? {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Mm . project manager: Odi industrial designer: Banana I think , it's a nice idea . project manager: Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then . industrial designer: Because {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: You y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that , user interface: Two of the button , yeah . industrial designer: but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , user interface: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: and here you have a a push button to {disfmarker} marketing: But you don't have {disfmarker} project manager: I think it's a good idea , yeah . user interface: Yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve , yeah , and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: So you can have it on on two sides and it'll be cool , project manager: Yeah . user interface: no ? project manager: I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then . Maybe we can keep the banana . And it will be very easy to find . industrial designer: And everybody knows what is a banana . user interface: You can put also vibrator inside . industrial designer: Basically . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: If you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha user interface: Ah-ha . You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Oh , yeah {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah it's really uh really a good point . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} I hope the students of management die , marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: but anyway . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Now who are recording this meeting ? project manager: I think it {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} One second . So we have to take some decision on this aspect . So , uh so for {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: sorry , for uh component , so {disfmarker} industrial designer: So {disfmarker} project manager: we have to think about those aspects , sorry . industrial designer: So we will just use a a standard battery ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: And uh the chip we {disfmarker} chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . Uh what do you mean by case ? project manager: I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape . industrial designer: Yeah . Uh I mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case , doesn't matter . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it . user interface: The only th Yeah . Y Yeah that can be in inside th in the structure . industrial designer: Yeah yeah . Yeah . user interface: But uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be {disfmarker} industrial designer: Spongy also . user interface: I mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to {disfmarker} I mean if it's spongy then it's going to move , right ? So , it's going to be bend a lot . project manager: But {disfmarker} industrial designer: Oh no I think it's possible . user interface: So if we try to push the buttons , it {disfmarker} project manager: No the button would be {disfmarker} user interface: You think it's possible ? project manager: In fact it it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah user interface: Okay . industrial designer: . This is uh like the {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay odd shape with spongy {disfmarker} cover . And standard battery okay , a chip imprint , there's no specific problem . So we agree to put the wheel {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Wheel on the top . Button , where do we want some buttons ? user interface: Well , usually hold {disfmarker} {vocalsound} 'Kay , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , right ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So it have to {disfmarker} it has to be symmetrical . user interface: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah but okay . Sa let's say that th o {vocalsound} It has to be {disfmarker} basically you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb . industrial designer: Yep . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yep . user interface: {vocalsound} Basically . Or you could use use this one , but I don't know if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel . project manager: Yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable . user interface: This for the wheel and then this for the buttons ? project manager: Yeah I think it's okay for both right and left . Mm . user interface: Should have the two sides . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: So if {gap} the left , we have {disfmarker} the op project manager: I think you can turn it this way also . You can do both with both hands . user interface: Wheel {disfmarker} Wheel buttons . project manager: I think it's okay . user interface: Yeah , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side . So you cannot see them . project manager: Well , you you will get used to it . user interface: Yeah . project manager: And moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons . user interface: So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be {disfmarker} Y Yeah I know , but uh if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side . project manager: Yeah . No you you {disfmarker} I think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty . I think for lefty it's okay . I can do this movement , and for righty as well . I think this doesn't change that much . user interface: Okay . project manager: Yeah ? user interface: Okay . Maybe . Yeah . project manager: So , for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side . And {disfmarker} and uh a wheel on the top . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . project manager: So the colour is yellow . I think it's uh {disfmarker} we defined everything according to what we should {disfmarker} what the decision we should take , yeah . So maybe we can um we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting . So have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision . And have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc {disfmarker} the product . That is to say , uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users , but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay . It seems to be fancy , innovative , and easy to use . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer uh work together . That would uh industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: be better , I think . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: And uh {disfmarker} And so uh you will receive further instruction by emails , as usual . user interface: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . project manager: So {vocalsound} user interface: Yes master . project manager: do you need to add anything ? user interface: No . project manager: {vocalsound} You feel okay ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: You feel uh free to express what you want to say ? You don't feel too constrained ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} You don't feel free to answer this ? user interface: No . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Maybe you can make {gap} uh {vocalsound} uh mm project manager: {vocalsound} Okay , so {disfmarker} user interface: okay . industrial designer: Thank you . project manager: See you .
