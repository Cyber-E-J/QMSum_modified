marketing: Hello . project manager: {gap} . {gap} . marketing: Yes , I made it . English from now on {vocalsound} . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound} marketing: Drawing or {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah just testing . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Mm ? English . industrial designer: Just kidding . project manager: {gap} . industrial designer: So annoying . project manager: Break is over . marketing: Ooh it works . project manager: Whoo . marketing: {vocalsound} Spicy . project manager: {vocalsound} Spicy . marketing: Where are are all the other presentations ? industrial designer: I just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be {disfmarker} marketing: The conceptual or {disfmarker} industrial designer: yeah I think so . Yeah , conceptual design . What or whatever does it {disfmarker} marketing: Ah . Because I see only my own presentation {vocalsound} {gap} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: No no no , can you go back one ? marketing: yeah . industrial designer: Uh 'cause it has to be PowerPoint pre yeah components design , that's it . marketing: This ? {gap} I'll just put it in there . project manager: So , he's coming . industrial designer: {gap} . {vocalsound} I did get a bit more done than the last time , marketing: Or not . user interface: Okay . project manager: Oh okay . industrial designer: 'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Ah , project manager: Ah . She {gap} . marketing: I can't cut and paste it into the other folder but {disfmarker} project manager: You can look at the final report , 'cause I have to record everything we are deciding and such , so I'm trying to write it down between everything else . marketing: Move to meeting room . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Sometimes I have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there , marketing: Yeah . project manager: Oh . industrial designer: and also with {disfmarker} I don't know how to use PowerPoint , so it takes me forever to get something done with it . marketing: Yeah me too , {gap} . user interface: {vocalsound} I I've got the same problem as well . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Here we go again . Welcome . Uh we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to uh {disfmarker} f the remote control has to support . industrial designer: Thi project manager: So who wants go . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: Yes . project manager: Yes ? industrial designer: Who wants to start ? marketing: Me first again or {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah sure . Doesn't matter . user interface: Oh . No . Yeah . No problem marketing: yeah . Alright . Did you open it already or {disfmarker} project manager: No . marketing: no . Ah . Ah . Yes . So welcome to the marketing presentation once again . Um this time about trendwatching . {vocalsound} Uh well there has been inv investigation again , in the in the remote control market . Uh it shows a number of developments . Uh I will address them uh in a moment . Um fashion watch watchers uh have detected the trends for young public , because that's our public . Um well fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing , uh shoes and furniture . And the feel of the material is expected to be spongey . So um the developments I will address them {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours . So to give you an idea . Um well the developments ? Uh development one . {vocalsound} Uh well most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel . Instead of the current uh functional look-and-feel . Um well fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and the interface . And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative . Um well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls . I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition , industrial designer: Sound . Yeah yeah uh uh . marketing: so I don't expect that to be a problem . And the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use . Um {disfmarker} Well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: So um that kind of gets you this ratios . So fancy look-and-feel uh is the most important uh point of attention . project manager: {gap} . marketing: Uh so the fruits and vegetables in combination with the spongey material . Um well technolog technological innovation , we've covered that pretty much I guess . Um and easy to use , I don't think that will be problem . So my point of attention is especially this part . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: That this will be a crux . So that was the marketing uh presentation . I had only one document left . industrial designer: And shall I go first ? user interface: Yeah . No . I I don't mi I don't mind . industrial designer: So I {disfmarker} user interface: That's {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah sure . No . marketing: So kind of this {disfmarker} user interface: Do you want to go first ? Okay . industrial designer: Yeah ? marketing: {vocalsound} So a k a small example . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: Kind of this this look . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing , and and some fruit and colours user interface: Yeah . marketing: I dunno . {vocalsound} Just made a quick design . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Cool . {vocalsound} Yeah you're just the user interface hmm ? user interface: It's better than than my uh drawing . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Alright . marketing: Alright . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah okay but I have to design the {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh components . project manager: Yeah layout . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah okay . industrial designer: Oh no . marketing: Yeah . It's okay . project manager: You probably opened it . industrial designer: Yeah true . Um {disfmarker} project manager: F_ five . marketing: F_ five . industrial designer: Alright . So {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I'm dealing with the components design . Um let's see . I uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products . And I used uh possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design . That's why I had to , wanted to go first . Well they gave me um an idea about what people want . We're f mainly focusing on this group , but I want to make the distinction clear . Uh I could not drag the pictures into the the slides so s so I don't have examples of how it looks like . But it comes down to what you uh what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking uh type . If you , the young dynamic people want soft primary colours uh , which looks like fruits you know , you can {disfmarker} and shapes that are curved and not uh solid straight lines anymore . So this basically um yeah goes on to what you were mentioning earlier . There is a lot of um {vocalsound} factors involved in choosing the components . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: There's a lot of options that we have to discuss . Uh for example the energy source . we have four types . The basic battery . Uh we have a hand dynamo , which we yeah we Dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Uh the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Which will be fun for toddlers right , if they wanna use the {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: And uh of course solar cells . But I dunno how we would use that into the design of the actual product . marketing: Wi an indoors . industrial designer: So uh my {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah okay . marketing: Oh . project manager: Calculator's can do it . industrial designer: yeah also also in you know countries where there's n isn't much light like in Scandinavia , they wouldn't be y able to use it half of the year you know . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: So that's not cool either . So um {vocalsound} for the uh a case , there's uh the traditional uncurved flat hard case . Single curved , which means that it has uh curves in one dimension . Or the double curved . Um {vocalsound} I wasn't able to finish my uh personal preferences sheet , but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now . Uh the case materials . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Well we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium . I would definitely go for rubber 'cause it fits most in what people wanna see nowadays . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Um poo , this is a lot of text . I wasn't able to organise this yet . We have yeah several uh interface designs . Uh we can use a scroll buttons for the menus , but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons . user interface: Yeah . Pushbuttons . Yeah . industrial designer: So that's not really interesting . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Electronics ? Yeah , {vocalsound} maybe we wanna decide on what electronics to use {gap} the advanced chip I think is easiest to implement uh for the production , 'cause they they can print it better . Um {disfmarker} Yeah . I think this is about it . Yeah I was working on some per personal preferences . I first uh chose for the battery , 'cause yeah I'm traditional and that's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to . But I really think that we should maybe uh think about the kinetic energy , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: where you have to move the thing to be able to use it . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: As an optional uh feature . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Or combine uh both with a with one uh project manager: Uh I think you can only fit one uh source of energy on the {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah maybe we {disfmarker} marketing: I guess we can only choose one . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: I can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make . But it is more longlasting , that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again . project manager: Yeah marketing: Yeah . And it's more fun . project manager: I didn't receive any info uh . industrial designer: And it's also more fun yeah . I always chuck my uh remote control around , so {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , just playing with it project manager: Yeah . marketing: and {disfmarker} especially when the material's rubber . It can be done , I mean , you can't harm it , project manager: S yeah it's safe . user interface: {vocalsound} And throw it {gap} . industrial designer: Yeah y exactly . marketing: so it's a perfect combination I guess . industrial designer: You don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the g floor and breaking it or whatever . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: So that's the end of it . user interface: Yeah . marketing: So {disfmarker} project manager: 'Kay next . industrial designer: Uh go ahead . marketing: So double curved is like this , this , this , or {disfmarker} industrial designer: No it means curved in two dimensions . So uh w single curved ? Uh let's say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: And double curved would means that it would have curves curves in every direction . Like three D_ . Yeah . marketing: Yeah . Also in in height ? project manager: Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah okay . project manager: Okay . Can we uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . One one uh very important thing I was uh yeah thinking about is the speech uh option . We were going to use that . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . So um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah um yeah that's one thing uh which I'm not sure uh of how to implement it uh into the remote control . project manager: Well the visual representation is not there with speech industrial designer: Design ? user interface: No okay but it has to be combined with with the menu uh for functions and {disfmarker} project manager: but you can {disfmarker} Yeah . Just {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: So okay . project manager: I think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present . user interface: Yeah . project manager: So I don't think you have to design anything else for that . user interface: Okay . marketing: Yeah with the programme . user interface: But do uh j do we uh do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ? project manager: Both . user interface: For for everything , project manager: Yeah . user interface: also for the advanced options ? Okay . Uh we have this {gap} very uh basic uh trendy design . Everybody says it so that's what's uh {disfmarker} yeah um {disfmarker} Yeah in the in the last uh meeting we uh we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated . That's yeah obvious . Um yeah . Pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control . And only the the L_C_D_ panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options . marketing: And and the and the buttons that you need to control it , I guess . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . Um yeah design has to be very attractive but that's your your op your {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {gap} {vocalsound} you have to uh delete this but this is the the the simple uh layout . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Uh display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button . project manager: That would be the back . user interface: I'm {disfmarker} The back . project manager: Back and okay . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Back and okay yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Back and okay . project manager: You did read the minutes I wrote ? user interface: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: You did read the minutes I wrote ? user interface: What ? A little bit I think but not not everything w industrial designer: I {disfmarker} project manager: Oh okay 'cause I pretty much summed up all the buttons there were . So {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . Oh {vocalsound} I uh didn't read that . project manager: I hate doing work for nothing . {vocalsound} user interface: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But this is the the basic uh design uh for the for the m yeah for the buttons . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Um {disfmarker} I wanted to to categorise everything . Uh with a speech display uh yeah , sound , everything you you noted in your uh minutes . Um every pushbutton has uh has its own uh LED light . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: So you can uh yeah change uh m make it more trendy for for younger people . And uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh luxurous {disfmarker} so that's an a also an option . Um that was it . project manager: {vocalsound} That was it ? user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Okay . Uh {disfmarker} {gap} again . Ugh . {vocalsound} Okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use ? Uh energy source , chip type , case type . And user interface . But I didn't see a clear distinction between these so I think what we have is okay . So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy . marketing: No . project manager: Uh the case would be doubly curved . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: And rubber . Rubber material . marketing: Rubber material . project manager: Rubber material . And that's the only thing we have left . industrial designer: Yeah we need the the chip on print to be able to support the the screen and uh and f audio function . project manager: Oh okay . No it's easy . {vocalsound} marketing: So that's uh {disfmarker} is that is that the advanced chip ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: Advanced chip . Okay . industrial designer: Otherwise you would have a simple chip , just for pressing buttons . But we need more . marketing: Wow . Yeah . Alright . industrial designer: I'm just thinking , this is not my department , but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost , marketing: Kinetic . Double curved . project manager: Too {gap} . industrial designer: to be able to m project manager: Uh I didn't get any info on this . So {disfmarker} marketing: {gap} . industrial designer: So 'cause we need to sell it for twenty five Euro a piece . project manager: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: That's gonna be difficult huh ? marketing: The cost of making it should be twelve and a half ? project manager: I have total here . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah I don't know . industrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah . project manager: I didn't get any information about that so {disfmarker} user interface: {gap} . We're going to produce it in uh China so it's no problem . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Child labour man , we love it . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , so it's cheap . project manager: Who doesn't . Uh let's see . Is there a new thing ? marketing: Um well the interface type supplements . project manager: Yeah the interface , maybe can {disfmarker} user interface: Uh it's it's quite difficult because we we haven't got all the options uh {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: Ooh . No . Uh do you have a picture of doubly curved case ? And could you put that in the group folder ? Of the project folder . industrial designer: Um let me see . Wait a sec . marketing: If you go to your homepage or something , you should industrial designer: Yeah I'm going there now . marketing: get your own information . industrial designer: Inspiration . marketing: I got my fresh and fyoo fruity uh picture uh also uh over there , so {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Ah you didn't draw it yourself . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well {disfmarker} marketing: No . project manager: {vocalsound} Ah . marketing: {vocalsound} Too less time . industrial designer: Um {disfmarker} yeah maybe it's {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , also the menu . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah that that w user interface: This is the the menu I was uh looking uh at . marketing: Yeah . Yeah I was thinking of that also , with with a with a uh arrow . industrial designer: Maybe it's easier {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Arrow . user interface: Arrow yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: So that indicates that there's an menu under that menu . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah perfect . user interface: Yeah . marketing: So {disfmarker} project manager: {gap} . 'S the target group . industrial designer: Maybe it's easier if you guys come over here . user interface: S yeah . project manager: Yeah sure . {vocalsound} industrial designer: S see this is the the the standard traditional type , where the form uh yeah serves the function , you know . marketing: Oh yeah . industrial designer: It's like really basic . But this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: This is what we're looking for . And th that means curved in both dire dire uh dimensions . project manager: Oh okay . I see . industrial designer: Not only like this but it has to be {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah also like this . So you can hold it . industrial designer: exactly . It has to be kind of instead of the PlayStation , the module . It has to be like the the Game Cube , you know , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold . And {disfmarker} user interface: But it has also to {disfmarker} it it has also to be uh luxurous uh for for yeah rich people . project manager: {gap} . user interface: Th this looks a little bit like like for only for children . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: It ha project manager: The children's story . Yeah I've got it . industrial designer: Yeah but that's that's the the problem uh yeah the dilemma actually , project manager: Distinction . Yeah . industrial designer: 'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with a lot of shape . And {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always , user interface: The colour {disfmarker} Yeah . Okay but the the colours , you you can make it uh make the colours with {gap} LEDs uh beneath the the buttons . industrial designer: you know , with the {disfmarker} project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: There is mobile phones , in which you can change the colour also of the lights . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Maybe we should consider this function . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: To customise it and so {disfmarker} I mean kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and people who want something , you know , different , or more uh design , they can go for one colour project manager: Different . Mm-hmm . industrial designer: like uh for example this uh photo th camera . project manager: Camera . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} Cool . S underwater uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah submarine . {vocalsound} marketing: yeah . industrial designer: Personally I think it's really ugly . project manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Just give me the thing that it's inside there {gap} project manager: Yeah but this this the {gap} is for the {gap} . user interface: Very cheap uh cheap look . industrial designer: maybe I'm too old for this stuff . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay . Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: So those I think are all my {disfmarker} marketing: {gap} . industrial designer: oh . project manager: Ah yeah bright colours . marketing: Yeah . Also a kind of rubber uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: And this is , this is with the curved that I mean . marketing: Yeah . project manager: That's singly curved . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah ? project manager: Okay . marketing: That should be nice . project manager: Well we could make a compromise between that . But I don't know if it's worth the effort . industrial designer: A compromise between what ? project manager: Uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved . So to appeal a little more to the all the public . marketing: So s industrial designer: This , this would be uh single curved uh ? project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Yeah there's only in in this dimension . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Like this . So curvy or not {gap} . project manager: Also . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} Exactly . Exactly . marketing: Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ? project manager: Yeah that would be an option . I don't know what you think . industrial designer: I think the {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: I mean our aim is to make something different right ? To make something new . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: I would go for the double curved . project manager: Okay . Yeah I'd agree . industrial designer: And I I'm I'm thinking uh you know uh a drawing palette , where you have the shape for your thumb . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: So it kind of holds nicely , something like that . user interface: Yeah but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons . industrial designer: Well this is really your decision but {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: If you have uh it have it in your hand , you you you are not only um yeah you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons . industrial designer: Yeah . As well . You can make a trigger button or something like that . user interface: Yeah . Something to shoot at your television {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah or that that is the confirmation button or something , project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: that you scroll with your thumb , with the arrows , and then confirm . user interface: That's {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: That would be a nice way to use it but {disfmarker} I mean , yeah , I'm thinking big already , and we need something that well that {gap} that you can able to use in one hand I think . project manager: Different . Stands out . Or {disfmarker} Oh yeah a one hand uh solution . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So from top view it looks kinda like this . But from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape . project manager: {gap} can turn it maybe . marketing: Maybe because the the screen is on top you can have {disfmarker} project manager: To switch from buttons to interface hmm . If you turn it a little . {gap} . industrial designer: {gap} . marketing: Maybe you can c have this kind of shape . A little upwards . So that the screen is more project manager: Oh yeah . Least you can easily see it . marketing: towards yourself , so you can easily see your screen . industrial designer: How about {disfmarker} marketing: Well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen . So then you have double double curved in some way . So this this is so the screen is positioned over here . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: Oh . Something like that . And the buttons are more , well it's very thick now but {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah I understand what you mean . marketing: That's uh that's {disfmarker} industrial designer: How about we do a uh a pop-up screen , like the laptop . project manager: If you can uh flip . industrial designer: So that the only the simple functions will be visible at first . marketing: Yeah ? That that you can press it and then it comes up ? Or {disfmarker} industrial designer: And then if you want {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Uh so you have a the the side view . industrial designer: Yeah . Something like that . marketing: But then the side view can be straight . If you have a pop-up screen . But I dunno if that's too expensive . project manager: So and you want to be able to industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: I mean maybe it's too much {disfmarker} project manager: make this industrial designer: No uh like {disfmarker} project manager: {gap} . industrial designer: I would draw it like this . Let's say this is the side view . That you have a a screen that will come up here , and can go down that way . If you know what I mean . user interface: Okay . Yeah . industrial designer: So that it would come up like that . project manager: Okay so the buttons are on top here , and you flip it over that way . industrial designer: Yeah or {vocalsound} preferably even keep the simple buttons here , and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons . project manager: Yeah . Oh yeah . Yeah yeah yeah yeah . Right . Yeah that's good idea . marketing: Oh the advanced buttons . Right . user interface: That's {disfmarker} the the more advanced options were uh for the for the menu . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: But you you want {disfmarker} industrial designer: F for the L_C_D_ menu right ? user interface: okay . You just want to hide them all ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: So w w project manager: No not all because you need most of them , the arrow buttons . user interface: The {disfmarker} oh . marketing: Yeah . project manager: But you can hide the okay and the back uh button . user interface: Yeah yeah yeah . project manager: And the menu button also because when you flip it open {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto uh uh automatically . industrial designer: Oh {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Activate and th the {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: So {disfmarker} okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open . project manager: Why ? You could just make it mechanical . industrial designer: True . True . But you can make a , yeah , you can make a trigger here . You know a simple uh {disfmarker} with a {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it , in combination with your {disfmarker} user interface: That's {disfmarker} but it's it's not industrial designer: Yeah . Exactly . user interface: it's not very uh very strong uh {disfmarker} yeah if you drop it one time {gap} . marketing: True . It uh c it can go open . industrial designer: Well yeah the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever . project manager: If you cover it with rubber . Mm . user interface: Okay . marketing: An adv an adv and it will be covered in some kind of uh thin rubber layer or something like that . industrial designer: And {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . So it can bounce . industrial designer: Exactly . Exactly . We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break . marketing: Yeah , uh {disfmarker} It's very no it's very strong . industrial designer: Th it's very solid yeah . project manager: Yeah okay so that that may work . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: That actually will offer some extra protection for the {disfmarker} project manager: Okay but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape . Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: What kind of {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah I was thinking , if if you have your hand , it this is your th project manager: Harder . marketing: Yeah the lower part doesn't work I guess , so maybe you should try it over there . project manager: {gap} . industrial designer: Okay . If this is your thumb , and this is your hand like that . With your uh wrist . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: That you , that it would be kind of shape like this , you know . So it's easier to hold in your hand , to y f user interface: But when you are left-handed , that's that's a problem . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Uh yeah . Yeah of course . project manager: Maybe can design two versions . industrial designer: Yeah then w then you would have to to make it like this . marketing: Yeah . user interface: But that's that's very expensive uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Like like you drew here . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: And maybe th then make this thicker also than the centre . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Give it {disfmarker} project manager: And ergonomical shape . Yeah . industrial designer: I would give it a female shape user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: but uh yeah . Anyway . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: The female shape yeah . With two uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Obviously . {vocalsound} Make it more appealing to guys . marketing: Yeah . user interface: We we could make some some rubber uh some rubber uh yeah mouse , with which you can change uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: I mean {disfmarker} project manager: Oh yeah . Some uh k esk uh {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: and so if you {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah but but that's optional for later I guess . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Okay . marketing: I mean , we have to make {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah but we have hardware inside , which is {disfmarker} so it has to have some sort of basic shape . user interface: Some {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: Yeah yeah . marketing: Yeah we we better so choose one {disfmarker} industrial designer: And also the screen , you cannot mould it . user interface: No no no no . {vocalsound} industrial designer: You know kind of thing . marketing: Yeah so okay we should better choose one sh one shape . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: But that's the kind of the idea , industrial designer: {vocalsound} And then you can {disfmarker} marketing: so it lays good in the hand , and then on on the side with with your thumb , industrial designer: You can place the screen here , which can come {gap} . marketing: you you can you can use , project manager: Yeah . marketing: yeah , you can use the button option {disfmarker} project manager: So the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ? industrial designer: And {disfmarker} but then I w I would {disfmarker} marketing: Spongey . industrial designer: I would do the arrows here , kind of thing . marketing: Spongey can be reached by means of {disfmarker} industrial designer: Those buttons ? And the simple buttons here , user interface: {gap} . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: so that {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . And and the and the control thngs in the middle ? The the the arrows ? industrial designer: I Uh y eah that's what I mean . user interface: No the arrow's over here . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: The arrows over here , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and here the s simple uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah and then numbers . project manager: Buttons . Okay . marketing: Yeah . Alright . project manager: I think that uh it's a nice design . marketing: Uh pretty nice design . Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} It's cool . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah it looks uh pretty fancy . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {gap} or do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something ? user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I dunno . marketing: {vocalsound} {gap} . project manager: Yeah that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh bananas {gap} wierd shape and other fruits also , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: so it's better to have um some sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary uh colours . industrial designer: Yeah we could make {disfmarker} marketing: I don't know what what colours should the basic print be like ? Like some soft {vocalsound} green or something ? project manager: Orange or something . marketing: Or {disfmarker} and then {disfmarker} user interface: Or blue ? Dark blue or {disfmarker} marketing: Oh yeah yeah , dark blue industrial designer: We should use {disfmarker} marketing: and then and then very bright , uh a yellow banana , {vocalsound} an orange , uh a green apple , stuff like that , user interface: Yeah . marketing: with very uh bright tones I guess . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: Yeah w we need very primary colours , like bright red , bright yellow . marketing: So you have something like {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah but the primary colours w we can uh create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah okay yeah . user interface: If you we uh {disfmarker} yeah . If you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it's just a neutral colour , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: also for the for the more uh yeah for the {gap} people . project manager: {vocalsound} Huh cool . marketing: Mm . {vocalsound} That doesn't really work . To draw , I guess . project manager: No it's {disfmarker} {gap} . marketing: Oh . What's this ? project manager: Yeah it's text . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Right . project manager: N no you have to exit . {vocalsound} marketing: Hm . project manager: {vocalsound} You could also make line with uh {disfmarker} user interface: So that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . Two hours further . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} thickness . Oh . user interface: So that's blue . marketing: Oh . Wh why not go for the twenty ? user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Mm . Yeah . marketing: Yeah . That's what I call painting . user interface: Mm . project manager: Y {vocalsound} marketing: So that's that's a dark blue basic colour I guess . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah and then on top of that . marketing: It's pretty nice . And then uh {disfmarker} Oh {disfmarker} project manager: Some yellow . marketing: Yeah with some some yellow banana {disfmarker} project manager: Banana colour . industrial designer: And how about some uh some flashing standby lights ? marketing: Like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Like you have on the Samsung , well I don't like to call brands phones , marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} the you know that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} 'cause I remember from one of our first meetings that uh people lose their uh remote controls often . marketing: Yeah ? industrial designer: So it {disfmarker} not not only in in the colours {vocalsound} of the LEDs , that we want something to keep it visible at all times , or {disfmarker} marketing: How do you mean ? project manager: Yeah if you if flashing colour so you can't lose it , basically . industrial designer: Um {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Some some {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . Exactly . project manager: Well I think it's a bit too much but {disfmarker} user interface: Maybe a {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah an orange . Well alright well this is more like purple I guess , project manager: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: but {disfmarker} it's should be more real dark blue , so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is uh pretty high . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So uh yeah . That would be a nice uh nice device I guess . user interface: And which which colour should uh should I give the the display ? Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Who ? user interface: Or {disfmarker} marketing: I mean , the the colour of the background of the display ? user interface: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: Ah well I don't guess it s has to be a sixty uh sixty six {vocalsound} five thousand uh colour , so yeah too expensive . project manager: And then you can use yellow or semething . Why not ? {vocalsound} Aye . user interface: Yeah . marketing: So just just a {vocalsound} a blue blue backlight or something like that . user interface: Mm . Yeah . marketing: Green is too old-fashioned . But blue , blue's okay . J industrial designer: As long as you loo {vocalsound} use uh high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour . user interface: Yeah project manager: Like this . user interface: maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ? industrial designer: So that people with uh with marketing: White backlight , and dark . user interface: Dark uh letters , yeah . marketing: Yeah . Whatever which is visible . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: I know you sh you should test it under uh under a light conditions . I mean it's hard to tell uh I dunno . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: And also for people who are a bit colourblind . project manager: Colourblind yeah . marketing: Yeah . True . project manager: No so that's mostly red and green I believe . marketing: Which which uh colour should the buttons be ? user interface: That's adjustable . project manager: Woah . All all buttons ? marketing: Why adjustable ? user interface: Yeah ? Or not . project manager: Okay . marketing: No uh {disfmarker} user interface: That's how we are going to make it uh more trendy . Or is it uh too expensive ? {vocalsound} marketing: But {vocalsound} maybe I mean they have to they have to have some colour right ? project manager: {vocalsound} It's difficult . marketing: And if the background is very dark blue {disfmarker} project manager: Blue . Maybe green . industrial designer: But don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours ? So th the total of the thing is very bright ? project manager: Yeah you can {disfmarker} industrial designer: Like the pictures I showed you guys . Those things were all like like bright red , bright red , flashy . marketing: Yeah ? project manager: Mm-hmm flashy . marketing: So more like {disfmarker} project manager: Mm bzz . marketing: Doesn't work very well . Uh . More like this colour . industrial designer: Yeah something like that , something that stands out more . marketing: And then then yellow and orange and red objects on it or something . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: But then then again , which colour should the buttons be ? The the press buttons . Should they be white or black or {disfmarker} project manager: Red maybe . user interface: And it it looks quite cheap , that colour I think . marketing: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Black . user interface: It's it's not {disfmarker} industrial designer: The green ? project manager: Why ? user interface: Yeah . I dunno . marketing: Yeah but it's pretty fresh , on the other side . project manager: Yeah . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: It's actually a pretty trendy colour at the moment . user interface: It's it's trendy okay . But {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: Mm . marketing: My couch is in that colour . project manager: Ooh . {gap} . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Well it works pretty well . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: And then time was up . project manager: Uh not yet . marketing: Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Do you get a pop-up if we {disfmarker} marketing: {gap} . project manager: Yeah within five minutes yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} That you have five minutes left or {disfmarker} industrial designer: Alright . project manager: Y left yeah left and then uh I have to kick you out . marketing: So something like this . user interface: Yeah . marketing: That should be pretty nice colour . But maybe the buttons , all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people . project manager: Yeah yeah . industrial designer: No that's actu marketing: Because the {gap} of the green . user interface: But the but the buttons have their own LEDs or not ? project manager: They have LEDs but they have a colour . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate . Even for colourblind . marketing: Yeah ? industrial designer: They will see one of each as grey . But if you use uh green on blue , those kind of colours will look the same . marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: I think . marketing: So red buttons are okay ? industrial designer: I think so . project manager: You can make them red . user interface: Okay . That that's a default uh setting . The the red buttons . project manager: Yeah . But I think you need to keep in mind that the LEDs are just extra light . {vocalsound} marketing: How do you mean ? project manager: Uh they they don't determine the colour that much , I think . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Okay . Yeah I I was think about a red uh red LEDs and blue LEDs and {disfmarker} project manager: 'Cause you have to print on them {disfmarker} you have a background marketing: No that's that's too busy I guess . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Each number is transparent . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Uh partly but you have to print on the number . Or the the sign . user interface: Okay . project manager: So you can't {gap} change the colour so {disfmarker} marketing: You better bet better better keep the LED and the button itself in the same colour I guess . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Okay . marketing: So just an extra project manager: Bit of light . industrial designer: You can {disfmarker} marketing: bit of light and attention . project manager: Bit of feedback . industrial designer: what we should do I think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with uh one coloured LED behind it . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: So that the whole button will shine project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: as the colour the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} And if you think about easy to use buttons , we have to , well we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold f for both hands , marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb , if you hold the machine . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay with {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} Don't mean to discourage you but {disfmarker} uh basically you two are going to work on the smartboard . Next thirty minutes to design something so {disfmarker} industrial designer: Ah , right . marketing: Alright . project manager: And the {disfmarker} You will do the evaluation . marketing: Of the product ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: Which we don't have yet . project manager: Yeah uh about {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} So wh how should I do that ? project manager: Yeah I don't know . {vocalsound} You probably get a mail . marketing: Oh okay . Or you you or you send it to me . Or just {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . Once they are finished . Yeah . marketing: because you are going to design it on this board right ? project manager: Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation {disfmarker} you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow . I don't know . marketing: Yeah . I I probably get instruction on that , how to do that , project manager: Yeah . marketing: so I make another presentation I guess . project manager: Yeah . marketing: I kn I know what's gonna happen in in yeah so {disfmarker} project manager: About . Yeah . You have the basic idea . marketing: I've a basic idea . project manager: And you two uh are going to do this . Look-and-feel and {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So we're gonna work here ? On this sketchboard ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Good luck . industrial designer: Alright . Thanks . marketing: Yeah . Alright so that's uh {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} So I {gap} uh make new page and uh be creative . marketing: Yeah . user interface: But we have to do it at this moment , after th this meeting ? industrial designer: Alright . project manager: Yeah you have uh industrial designer: Thirty minutes . project manager: thirty minutes . user interface: Okay . project manager: Then we have to uh see something which we can uh user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Alright . project manager: show to the management . user interface: Ah so this is basically the what what we are thinking about ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: I would yeah . industrial designer: Shall we uh make a new uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah l let's just uh delete all these uh {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Next . marketing: {gap} . industrial designer: Yeah , I just {vocalsound} make a new one . user interface: Oh , next {gap} . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Oh and save this uh board . industrial designer: Alright . project manager: Just save it . industrial designer: Huh ? Yeah I'll just I'll just keep it there . project manager: Yeah okay but just press save and uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: It'll be fine . marketing: On the left . S so , yeah . industrial designer: Uh sorry . project manager: {vocalsound} You can also include clip-art . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay . project manager: So if you'll rather draw in paint or something {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Current colour ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: So um {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Shall we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first ? user interface: Yeah . And then after that we can make the user uh inter interface . industrial designer: Because {vocalsound} I I {disfmarker} project manager: {gap} then look . industrial designer: Yeah 'cause I have to uh focus on the on the basic look-and-feel design . marketing: This ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So how it's gonna look . And you have to think uh how we're gonna put the screen in it and those kind of things . marketing: Uh pretty accurate . industrial designer: So if I'm drawing and you think okay I'm not gonna be able to put a screen in there , you have to correct . marketing: Oh we skip this I guess . Sound {gap} button press . user interface: Yep . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Uh do you mind if I draw in black then ? For normal sketches . project manager: You can also include it . It's not much work . user interface: Oh no it's it's okay . marketing: Light only button user ca user interaction . industrial designer: {gap} so we kind of want the girlish marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: That's included . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah okay . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: figure . marketing: So the pl the plastic plastic buttons also help uh because of um they are only lit during interaction . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: I'm not so good at drawing . Excuse me ? marketing: Well it's a good thing that the buttons aren't um , well that they are plastic , because then you can light up the light on {gap} when when they are usable . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: No uh uh . marketing: Maybe you should draw it very large {vocalsound} like this . user interface: Yeah but this part isn't uh functioning properly . project manager: Yeah . Sensitive . marketing: Oh right . industrial designer: How do we uh uh marketing: Erase ? industrial designer: or insert text ? project manager: I dunno . Maybe just start typing . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} It's a bit uh large . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Oh that's a bit big . Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: You also do the other sides . Not only on the front si uh the top side but also the the side view . user interface: {gap} . industrial designer: Yeah . Ex exactly . user interface: L let's make first the the the all the views . The the front view , side view and the back view . industrial designer: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Uh . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh I thought for the side view , that the w the basic section would be rather uh a bit thicker than the middle , where you're holding it with your {disfmarker} project manager: Jesus . What do I write down ? {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Why can't I work here ? This is much easier . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Much easier , yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: 'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and {disfmarker} user interface: The middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand . project manager: Mm . marketing: I don't see a sign that the meeting is over yet but {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Exactly but the uh but the upper side has to be a bit more like that I think . project manager: No so I just work here a few minutes . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: Yeah the display , industrial designer: Uh don't you think ? user interface: we yeah we can put a display . industrial designer: So the display we will put in here , the basic uh functions in here , where it's most reachable . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: The {disfmarker} user interface: The the arrow functions . Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: The th Exactly . Oh . This is hard . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: What do {disfmarker} {gap} don't have to draw it exactly do we ? user interface: No it's it's uh it's okay . industrial designer: Wait . Let me try it one more time . Maybe I've uh {disfmarker} it's easier if I draw it in once . Okay , of course it will become way more ugly . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} You can make it m larger . Maybe it's easier to to draw uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . This'll take forever . It's fun to work with this pen . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Um so , larger . marketing: Oh . user interface: Yeah that's that's the basic idea . Yeah . industrial designer: And {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Wrong one . industrial designer: yeah . So side . project manager: Five minutes left before the meeting ends . industrial designer: 'Kay . Um other views ? project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Alright . user interface: Yeah only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit . industrial designer: Uh {disfmarker} user interface: That's the question . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} Let's fill i fill in the buttons later . marketing: But we we {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So this is gonna be from the marketing: I is it {disfmarker} if if this is from the side {disfmarker} industrial designer: uh from {vocalsound} user interface: From the {disfmarker} marketing: woah . Steady . industrial designer: yeah yeah . Sorry . marketing: Because there the screen goes up like that right ? industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So then it's like this , industrial designer: Yeah ? marketing: or {disfmarker} that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the {disfmarker} it's better to have it somewhat like this . Or does it flip all the way ? user interface: Yeah I'm I'm {disfmarker} industrial designer: The the idea is that it has to flip up to here . user interface: May maybe it's it's easier to to integrate the the the L_C_D_ screen just into this this bubble . Because it do doesn't have to flip then . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Because we have en enough space for for making a an L_C_D . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . user interface: Because here {disfmarker} marketing: It's better to to have this like this I guess , and then flip it like this . industrial designer: True . user interface: But why why do we need uh the flipping uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {gap} you can adjust the angle to which it flips . So it can also from this angle , it can flip all the way up to there . user interface: Okay . Yeah . industrial designer: You can flip it up to there if you want . marketing: Yeah . So w yeah . But we still keep the flipping mechanism . project manager: Yeah we keep the flip ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Think so . project manager: Keep the flip live . industrial designer: Yeah because I think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: I dunno . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Uh the the shape is okay but {disfmarker} yeah ? I don't see the the yeah why why we should use the the flipping uh mechanism . industrial designer: {vocalsound} I thought it would be cool . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . user interface: Because we {disfmarker} Okay yeah . It's it's for for for more trendy uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah but maybe {disfmarker} Yeah but maybe we we should then {disfmarker} user interface: Because we have enough space . H here we got uh the basic functions , the the arrow uh yeah button . marketing: Yeah there the middle {disfmarker} Sh sh shouldn't we integrate it ? user interface: Yeah and then h we sh mm . marketing: And then like i oh th {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: doh . Come on . So this is the shape . Oh . It hasn't {disfmarker} industrial designer: {gap} . It doesn't aim so well . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay but the screen is a bit lower because if it falls on the other side , it doesn't fall on the screen . user interface: Yeah , then it's {disfmarker} marketing: So there's a layer of rubber on the side . industrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah . Definitely . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: So no flipping but just {disfmarker} user interface: No flipping or {disfmarker} project manager: No flipping ? marketing: no . user interface: {gap} you wanted the flipping so {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah I guess but uh I mean most votes count right ? user interface: But if you if you {disfmarker} If you drop it it it just breaks . And it has to be very strong because of the {gap} . Yeah kind of {disfmarker} project manager: It's shaking . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Throwing and the kinetics . Oh . We better make we better make it like this . Eventually . industrial designer: Yeah true true . project manager: Yeah just light on top . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: And it's also for the for the children , it's yeah for people not sixteen years . industrial designer: Yeah if you if you're going for the kinetics {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Safer . Mm . Yeah okay that {gap} the target group . user interface: But there are more {disfmarker} marketing: Uh they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone , so also to to deal with their uh remote uh control . Yes . user interface: Yeah okay . That's true . Okay . Yeah ? project manager: Well . I just uh ended the meeting . industrial designer: Yeah . I'm just thinking totally different designs also . project manager: You two go design . user interface: Okay wi industrial designer: Remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a Gameboy . project manager: Oh . By the way . Um {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Maybe we should try something like that . But yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: I uh thought up a name for our product . Yeah . It's called uh the Real Remote . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Oh right . marketing: Yeah ? project manager: {vocalsound} With a copyright sign after Real . {vocalsound} marketing: Ooh . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Alright . user interface: {vocalsound} The Real Remote . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} Alright . industrial designer: Yeah . I like it . project manager: So maybe you can include that somewhere . industrial designer: Okay . This can go . marketing: Good . Yeah . We should work in our own room right ? Or not ? project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Oh yeah we have to f uh include that in our design as well . project manager: I don't see any power cables here so {disfmarker} industrial designer: Let's see . marketing: Yeah . Yes . industrial designer: What the hell's that ? project manager: 'Kay . user interface: {vocalsound} I think uh it's the sensors . marketing: See you two in half an hour uh {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Good luck . {vocalsound} user interface: Yep . Okay that's the side . Ah it's it's okay . But do we want uh options on the on the side with the with the buttons ? industrial designer: Yeah . I think we do . user interface: Or just leave it ? Uh could make an uh a volume button uh scroll , volume button . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah or j or also scrolling for the m yeah . user interface: For menu . Or {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah ? I dunno . We w kind of wanted to stick with the {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . No , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah I'm just thinking , {vocalsound} if we i we wanna make something different project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: right ? So the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: I think . user interface: Mm . Yeah you are going to design it so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
