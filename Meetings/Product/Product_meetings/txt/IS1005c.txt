project manager: Hello , uh this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . marketing: Hello . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: Hello . project manager: Um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be , but uh in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision . So , uh we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and uh I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions . So , who wants to start ? Okay . user interface: I s marketing: Okay . user interface: No , no , you you can start . project manager: So start , uh marketing: Okay , I'll start . Can you open my presentation , project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: please . project manager: Uh . {gap} marketing: I'm number four . project manager: This one ? marketing: Trend . Yep . Can you pass the mouse , please . {vocalsound} Oh okay , that's fine . project manager: Turn . marketing: Okay . Um so basically I just want to presented to you {disfmarker} present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world . Um the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel , um as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority . Um fancy is is is is the , you know , highest priority . project manager: Hmm . industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative . Um so this is t number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria . Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well , but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control . {vocalsound} From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan , um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture . So , {vocalsound} I'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category . And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy . project manager: Okay . marketing: Um so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way . industrial designer: What does it mean , spongy ? marketing: Uh sort of um squishy . industrial designer: Like soft , or something ? marketing: Um . Yeah soft , project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: like a uh like a sponge . project manager: Like a sponge . {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} I don't know . Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . I will see . marketing: Um so in conclusion , we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy , um has lots of technolog tech technology in it . {vocalsound} Um somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: And that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our {disfmarker} of th the Real Reaction company . Um . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , uh yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} That's it . project manager: Easy to use , is it uh a as much as important than technology or fancy thing . It's less important , right ? marketing: Less important . project manager: Yeah yeah . marketing: So um fanciness first and then two ti you know , half as important as that is technology technology , project manager: Okay . marketing: and half important as technology is easy to use . So . project manager: {gap} So , Hamed , can you {gap} . user interface: Yeah . The second one . Could you please show the presentation number three . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature . project manager: {vocalsound} Um . Number ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} We'll see . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Three . user interface: Three . project manager: This one ? {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yes . {gap} Just Could you please check if it is the first one or the second . Uh , n n no , it's the first one . The second one . project manager: So it's not this one . user interface: Uh yeah . Okay . {gap} Okay . So I am going to talk about {disfmarker} a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . I think uh I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but okay , we can discuss about it uh later . Um {vocalsound} generally , generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something , in my opinion , uh the first feature is just to be easy to use . So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control . And uh s uh I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . It should be {disfmarker} we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control . {vocalsound} Okay . So what I found out that uh as I said uh I think it's better to put uh more frequent uh uh uh ke uh buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size . Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can {disfmarker} which should be taken easily in hand . It should not be completely like uh a cube . It should be it should have round edge , so uh then it's easier . industrial designer: Exactly . user interface: And maybe uh just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand . And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not uh consume lots of energy . Okay . And my personal p uh preference is uh , as I said , uh just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button , like mobile phone . Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control . And if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this . Uh . And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . Not on remote control . I dunno if I can explain well . But uh just inside . For example , a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb . So it can be another uh preference . And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good . I know that it consumes lots of energy , but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new . So it may not be very useful but because it's new , people may buy it . Uh I personally think there should be a big difference between uh between something . Otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company , or . Okay . That's mine . project manager: Okay . {gap} industrial designer: Uh okay , so good news from me uh uh for me from Hamed , but bad news from Bob obviously , because spongy design , I don't like it as {gap} {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay , so could you please , Fabien , open it . project manager: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I'm person two . And which one , uh probably the first one . I'm not sure but check the first one . I {disfmarker} Most of the things I have to write myself on the board , but {disfmarker} project manager: This one , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , that's it . Just {disfmarker} It's only this slide ? Yeah . This this is just uh one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just uh I just found this , that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers or I'll just {disfmarker} marketing: Inch . industrial designer: Yeah , seven seven inch T_ {disfmarker} T_F_T_ screen , which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there . Uh so I I probably draw it down raw scheme . project manager: Oh , {gap} . industrial designer: This is this is the stuff that I can use to {disfmarker} project manager: Oops . industrial designer: Okay , so the {disfmarker} this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view . Uh first thing is uh this will be the overall shape , no uh I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device . So there will be some circuit uh for the power . So , say power circuit here . Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can uh uh {disfmarker} And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything . I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells , so . So no problem . There can be also solar cell . Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: So at least seven to seven . It depends where you put your screen , because the screen is uh seven inch , so it depends on you where where you put it . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: It doesn't matter . Um it's just one cord from from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere . So this will be T_F_T_ . And on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone , which is somewhere , say here . Interface to the microphone . Then the graphical card uh for the T_F_T_ and the third unit is the I_R_ . The good news is that we can uh we decided to use the infra-red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the stuff inside , so it will be very cheap for us . So infra-red here . So the {disfmarker} once again the overall requirements , seven to seven centimetres for the board , which has to be {disfmarker} which can be spongy but has to be this size , and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches . Um I have to check what I wanted to {disfmarker} Uh from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des uh ov all the device . project manager: Can you fit any uh for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ? For example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , I can I can imagine it could be a problem . industrial designer: {vocalsound} A all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically . project manager: Yep . industrial designer: But we have to take care of the T_F_T_ . Well , sponginess . Maybe it a good feature , since it takes {disfmarker} if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe , project manager: Okay . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: I dunno . user interface: Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside . marketing: So project manager: Okay . Maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around . {gap} maybe after . industrial designer: Well , it's maybe related to the U_I_ . marketing: So {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . marketing: Ca Can I ask a question . {vocalsound} industrial designer: A Yeah , that's all from me . marketing: This seven inch T_F_T_ screen , industrial designer: Yeah ? marketing: how big is it in reality ? industrial designer: Well , seven to seven inches . marketing: So like that . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: That's quite big . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ? project manager: No , I don't think it's seven by seven , industrial designer: Yeah but {disfmarker} project manager: I think it's seven {disfmarker} the diagonal is seven . industrial designer: To be honest , I was {disfmarker} project manager: Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal . user interface: Yeah yes {gap} . marketing: But I mean even even that is like this big . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} I dunno I dun I dun One each {gap} user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} project manager: . But , yeah , {gap} . industrial designer: Yeah , honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: but it's seven inches . But I I think we can we can cut it . marketing: You can cut the T_F_T_ screen . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Let's go . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , no no problem , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth . project manager: {vocalsound} So let's cut the T_F_T_ . industrial designer: So {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , but no problem to to me to cut the screen . user interface: Mm . marketing: Okay , so {disfmarker} industrial designer: So so for the same price we have four screens now {vocalsound} . project manager: Mm . marketing: Okay . project manager: These technical engineers , huh . marketing: So , what's the size of the device ? industrial designer: Ah well this is like this is almost nothing . Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something . marketing: Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know . marketing: Is it {disfmarker} Can you hold that , or ? industrial designer: Because if it's t too small we can we can lose it , at home , you know . project manager: {vocalsound} What user wants . He wants a small remote control , or ? Uh uh with big buttons . user interface: Uh . industrial designer: I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something . marketing: Yeah , a small c control that they can hold in hand . project manager: It's difficult . user interface: Yes . project manager: {vocalsound} A sm industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: But is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold ? user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: W I I think so . I if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and you know follow follow {disfmarker} Well , that's that's no task for me , but well seven to seven at least yeah , project manager: {vocalsound} So maybe you can finish your presentation , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: and afterwards we will discuss about all this . industrial designer: but {disfmarker} Oh , okay . user interface: Maybe this {gap} . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: Okay thanks {gap} . project manager: That's it . Okay . So . {vocalsound} {gap} No . Uh , so I think we have a lot {disfmarker} We have to take decision today , so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions . Uh first I think energy it's a key problem because uh it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , for example , or something like that . Because can we have L_C_D_ and speech recognition with battery , and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device ? industrial designer: Not {disfmarker} J uh just a point to the energy th things . If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_ uh speech recognition and L_C_D_ , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so no problem in energy , I think . project manager: So {disfmarker} Okay . industrial designer: But we have to use the solar cell . user interface: So but {disfmarker} project manager: Uh like {disfmarker} industrial designer: Otherwise not . project manager: but using how many batteries , for example ? Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery {gap} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah I was thinking just common A_A_ cells . project manager: Okay . Uh one two {disfmarker} industrial designer: So like three to five centimetres , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: I dunno exactly , but . marketing: So if we use s solar cells , um where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ? industrial designer: S Uh d doesn't need to be sun . It it's just the daylight , you know . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: The television lights . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah well I I suppose that I suppose that uh that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this , where there is light only when when there are people , but . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: At least when there is T_V_ you can get light from the T_V_ . industrial designer: Yeah from the T_ {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: I don't think it's enough , uh . project manager: {vocalsound} I dunno . marketing: Okay . project manager: Okay . Mm . industrial designer: Ah it's a it's a compromise , no ? marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: At least it's new and maybe technology New technology . industrial designer: Yeah , that's why I wanted to to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things . marketing: It's it's quite innovative , yes . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Hmm . project manager: Um . marketing: And if you watch T_V_ outside it's {vocalsound} very useful . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: So I think before talking about the other thing , it's important thing it's the case . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh what what are gonna be the size , because its weight drives the other {disfmarker} what we are going to use as features and so on . For example for the for the L_C_D_ , if we choose to have a small device , we cannot use this um a such a a a screen . industrial designer: Uh the s the screen is okay , but the board , uh that's the problem . Well what what would you guess as a shape ? Or what what would be the shape ? user interface: Mm . I think I think their being uh large or small is not important . The only important thing is to be able to take it in uh inside hand easily . So let's say an average size , okay , industrial designer: Mm . user interface: and it should not be very heavy also . And I prefer to {disfmarker} is it shouldn't have a uniform shape , so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe maybe . So we c it's like like some joysticks . You can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . So the general shape should be like this . I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large . So uh seven {disfmarker} not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's {disfmarker} that's my opinion . It's easier . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Which is the same area . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Could you re could you redesign your board ? industrial designer: Five to ten . Well that {disfmarker} marketing: Oh , five five centimetres by ten centimetres . industrial designer: Yeah , right . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , I think it's feasib Well one um um {disfmarker} How could we do it ? We could put the board next to , well , under the L_C_D_ and for example make the L_C_D_ be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Like holding something , and the L_C_D_ to be just on top of it , you know somehow . Well {disfmarker} But maybe let's stick to the s spongy thing , like one unit . project manager: Oh . I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible . industrial designer: Well fi five to ten it would be feasible . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Okay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible . project manager: Okay . So we are agree with a small industrial designer: I'll make it . user interface: {gap} Or uh or I don't know project manager: L_C_D_ . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Fo Five by ten . user interface: but I don't want to now invent something new , because we didn't discuss about it . So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Touching the screen . Something like project manager: Tactile or something , yeah . user interface: {disfmarker} Mm like tactile . marketing: Mm , touch screen . project manager: Touch screen , yeah . user interface: So {disfmarker} But for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens I I think we using a a smaller screen is better , project manager: Yeah . user interface: because {disfmarker} project manager: The problem is we have a limit in a month of time , so we cannot do something very new . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: So let's go for a small L_C_D_ . marketing: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay , so Yeah , so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me user interface: A smaller s project manager: Yeah okay . user interface: Okay . project manager: So , five by s ten . industrial designer: and I will work it out . marketing: {gap} industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: Um so what about , so the case we talked about . Um something easy to use , you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ? My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the {disfmarker} it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and {disfmarker} industrial designer: Seven to ten banana . project manager: {vocalsound} A big banana . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay . Rather mango or something or . project manager: Um . {vocalsound} marketing: Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: {gap} marketing: I mean what other what other fruit and vegetables {disfmarker} project manager: But it's just an idea . I dunno what you think about , but {disfmarker} marketing: Do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: I dunno if it can fit with the technology . You are the specialists of that . industrial designer: You mean banana . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well , but {disfmarker} If it's {gap} {vocalsound} {disfmarker} If it {disfmarker} If the banana is big enough . project manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Then , yes . {vocalsound} But if you want to look at the screen {gap} , no . Well {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , and industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: I think this {gap} is not good . {vocalsound} project manager: The screen has to be {vocalsound} square ? Or it can be like a a shape , quite , uh with curves . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well , it can be whatever you want . project manager: It could . {vocalsound} industrial designer: But if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: It's like more more expensive to have shape like that . But I don't care . You know , if we fit this requirement . marketing: Well {disfmarker} I'd like a shaped screen . I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen . project manager: Okay industrial designer: Okay {disfmarker} project manager: okay . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Yeah , m maybe the banana could be like a bit uh fatter than than the c c common one . project manager: Yeah . Yeah , it should remember banana , but it's not {disfmarker} doesn't have to b to be uh uh really the size and exactly the shape of a banana . user interface: {gap} industrial designer: But {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Like modified banana , okay . project manager: So we are agree with the banana thing ? industrial designer: Well it {disfmarker} we'll stick to banana , or ? user interface: Okay . marketing: Yeah , banana's good . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: Mm-mm . project manager: So , {gap} the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think infra-red . project manager: Everybody's agreed . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . Sure . project manager: Uh , so that's it I think about the concepts . You have other thing to add to this point , or uh no ? So , uh about the user interface , so we are going to use L_C_D_ . In the last meeting we talked about uh hidden buttons . I don't know what we are going to do with that . You talked about the buttons on the side {disfmarker} industrial designer: Like like peeling of the banana you s {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , peeling of the banana . project manager: Mm what ? industrial designer: It would be cool , yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Peeling of the banana , you know , project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: should should discover the other buttons , which are hidden . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Mm . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . And you mean the first layer would be spongy . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} First layer obviously spo Yeah , project manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: w It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah I think . project manager: Is it is it possible to do that ? It would be a great idea , but is it possible technically ? user interface: Uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: Like doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it . marketing: I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that , project manager: Yeah . marketing: you know , to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and {disfmarker} user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: Yeah , some {disfmarker} Something like a plastic cover covering uh some interface , U_S_B_ interface as in the in uh digital camera . If you see it's like peeling . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor . So keys can be uh buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover and uh when uh and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana . So , something like this . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , but do you see that as a rigid thing , or like like a banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or . industrial designer: Well is it possible to make it soft ? user interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover , so . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: So I think if it's so then it's cool ? project manager: So , I dunno what you think , Bob , but it would be great for users I think , and very good for marketing . marketing: I think for sure . Definitely . The softer the better . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Cool . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Honestly speaking , I cannot imagine it , so far , project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: but it will be terrible . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Um . And setting buttons hidden in {gap} . industrial designer: Mm . project manager: Mm , other remarks , or something , or . Something we didn't talk about yes yet , or . I think we are almost there {gap} . Uh maybe , how can we , if we have a soft thing , like this , and to open it we have to attach it somewhere , I dunno how to do that technically , or . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: And how {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Pof . marketing: We could use Velcro . project manager: Yeah , maybe . marketing: Or uh ma maybe a magnetic user interface: Yes , yeah {gap} it's a good idea . marketing: thing . project manager: Ma magnetic {gap} oh . user interface: Magnetic {gap} . Mm . Yeah or a {disfmarker} Yeah it can is it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh {vocalsound} materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely . project manager: Okay . user interface: And when you try to open it , it will be opened easily . So you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're uh while while uh you are commonly using uh buttons on the banana . project manager: Okay . And what would be the matter here of the first layer I mean ? Mm . Likes . Soft plastic , or {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , I imagine some sort of vinyl thing . project manager: Yeah , yeah , yeah . marketing: In a in a sort of a with a suede sort of feel . Maybe . industrial designer: Well since since the since the things like the like the screen and um how to say that , solar cell has to be has to be like kept kept in the shape , we cannot b uh {disfmarker} So we need that the that the peeling {disfmarker} uh I dunno but we should we should take care of these two two things . So , if if uh the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed , then the material must be able to put the light inside , you know . So that we can reach the energy out of it {disfmarker} out of that . user interface: Mm . marketing: Mm . So you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and industrial designer: It is possible , but , well if it {disfmarker} marketing: And a and a banana . industrial designer: I dunno . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: I dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it , or or inside . project manager: Hmm . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: But then it must be some window there , you know . marketing: Okay . user interface: Mm . project manager: And something we forgot , maybe , uh about the speech recognition system , are we going to use it , or not ? marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Yes , I think .
