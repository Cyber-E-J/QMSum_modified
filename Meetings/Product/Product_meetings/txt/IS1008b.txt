project manager: Okay uh Agnes , you can help me for the slide when {gap} user interface: Yep . Sure . project manager: okay . Okay , welcome back . I hope uh you have a fresh head and a fresh time . How t now the meeting actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting . Okay , and uh we'll issue some information from uh all of you . And it's in the , I think uh , in the sharing folder . And uh I will invite uh the Christine and the Ed and uh Agnes to discuss about on the various subjects . So can you go to the next slide ? Yeah uh the agenda of the meeting is opening . Then uh I'm going to talk about uh the project management , what I'm going to do , and uh , of course , I'm doing the project management and secretary both , okay , to take the minutes of the meeting . And there are three presentations . One is uh new project requirements . And the second one about uh decision on remote control functions . And uh finally we are closing . Uh and the meeting time will be uh forty minutes , so you have to be very quick . And I have come up with the {disfmarker} management come with the new proposal , okay , and I have to discuss a few points on this . Uh both says new insights in the aim of your project . Uh the one is uh the teletext becomes uh outmoded , okay because if uh because of the computer systems and the new technology . So we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design . And the second one is about uh the remote control . Should be used only for the T_V_ . That's what our uh management says . And the third point , it's very very important to establish our uh marketing or uh corporate image , okay , with this new project or new product . Okay . {vocalsound} So I will invite uh {disfmarker} Agnes , can you go to the third slide ? user interface: No , this is the third slide . project manager: Okay , {gap} . So , I'll invite uh Christine to discuss about uh the functional design . industrial designer: 'Kay , do you wanna open the {disfmarker} user interface: Sure . Um . You're participant s industrial designer: I'm number two . user interface: Two ? project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: That's it . user interface: Do you want the mouse , or do you want me to {disfmarker} industrial designer: I'll do the notes . Yeah , thanks . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So um well I I figured uh we should um identify some user requirements , and from my experience , I wanna uh , and from {vocalsound} research I did , uh the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button , you can't uh can't have like uh waffling on this point , you know . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Really have {disfmarker} It needs to be able y y have to be able to find it . Because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them . So uh , I also , since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product , thought we better look at things that are popular and um ex go beyond those , and , as I said in the first meeting , um {vocalsound} and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction , especially in the the uh the outside of the product project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: so that it gives the appearance , and it is reliable , and so forth . {vocalsound} I did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls and when they were invented and so forth , so , I guess this guy Zenith uh created the Flashmatic , which I kinda like the idea , 'cause it made me think of um um maybe the remote control made a big flash when uh you turn the T_V_ on and off , that might be interesting . And um {vocalsound} so it was highly directional flash light that uh you could turn the picture on and off , and the sound on and off , and change channels c so I think um those are still requirements we have today , uh fifty years later . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: And uh it was really a pioneering innovation , but it was uh sensitive to the sun , so that uh it would get {disfmarker} would start off by the {disfmarker} you'd get {disfmarker} it would easily cause um problems . So , uh I {disfmarker} in addition to uh looking at the um {vocalsound} uh the functional requir so all these devices are examples of where uh mm {disfmarker} they {vocalsound} represent examples that are available today {vocalsound} {vocalsound} which I think the one in the middle is r um really uh something to keep in mind . marketing: Fantastic . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: It'd be easy to find . And um it would uh y you'd {vocalsound} {disfmarker} you could throw it at things if if the T_V_ didn't turn on and off , you could use it for something else . And since I'm not really um {vocalsound} Industrial Designer , I didn't really know what to do with this slide . But um {vocalsound} I just {vocalsound} took some {vocalsound} different uh schematics and I put them into this , and I guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board . {gap} I don't know why um we were asked to do this . So , uh {vocalsound} personal preferences , {vocalsound} um user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I think we could uh I I'm really thinking outside the box here , and I think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So something that's very very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it . I think um it could either be {disfmarker} you could go either one extreme , be very colourful , or you could make it clear , and um kind of blend in with things , so you didn't have to um {vocalsound} uh have a problem with the th the decoration of the {disfmarker} of the user's home . Um I think uh it needs to be waterproof , because uh sometimes they fall into cups project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: and , you know , it might be out by the swimming pool or something like that . Um {vocalsound} if you uh mi one of {disfmarker} one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it's done its job or not , because half the time , I keep pushing on the remote control , and I don't know if it's actually understood my message , so I think it should give you some sort of an oral cue . And uh , course I never wanna replace the battery . {vocalsound} So , marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: that's {disfmarker} those are my f preferences , and that's my presentation . project manager: Yeah , let me uh interrupt you uh if you can add other facility , other feature , like uh unbreakable . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Okay , because uh especially today , you know , you have the family and the kids , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: okay , and the kids throw it and they they play with their remotes and {gap} . industrial designer: Run over it with a car . project manager: Yes . Okay , so if you can add the feature , okay , for your uh fabric whatever in your outline design okay , with unbreakable , okay , I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product , if I'm not wrong . Maybe you can uh add it in that . industrial designer: Good idea . Good idea , I'll I'll uh um {disfmarker} Yes , very good . project manager: Okay , uh thank you Christine , and uh uh any questions or uh clarifications , or any discussion on the functional design ? user interface: Do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials ? 'Cause , for example , in the unbreakable thing , doing something plastic would be harder , industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: whereas having something like , I dunno , steel or titanium isn't really economically viable . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Titanium . Titanium would be {vocalsound} be heavy , too , marketing: Titanium . {vocalsound} industrial designer: wouldn't it ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: No , I haven't really um {disfmarker} I wanted feedback , I think we need to rate {disfmarker} rank these , but we'll see what your uh personal preferences are and your thoughts . user interface: Yeah . Sure , yeah . No , I just wondering whether {disfmarker} that you had any sort of {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} I like titanium . It's light . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Uh {vocalsound} yeah marketing: Expensive . user interface: {vocalsound} The marketing comes out . {vocalsound} industrial designer: but uh who who said {disfmarker} who said we were , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yes . industrial designer: you know , nobody told me how mu what our financial objective is , so um {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah so {disfmarker} industrial designer: It'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though {vocalsound} . project manager: Yeah the the {disfmarker} I'm sorry because uh the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh let me go quickly , maybe if I can go back {vocalsound} . I know the project plan and the budget . So I can close this , {gap} not sure . Was in uh {disfmarker} S This . So let me see where is this file . user interface: That's Christine's . project manager: This is Christine . {vocalsound} user interface: And that's mine , I think . project manager: That's yours , okay . Saving . marketing: {vocalsound} {gap} user interface: In modified . marketing: I don't know , project manager: Okay , uh marketing: I think verbally we can {disfmarker} we can pretty much sell . project manager: I will {disfmarker} I will send you a mail , okay ? The project may be the the project aim , okay . At the end of the day , the company uh wants to make at least uh the fifty million Euro . Okay , and uh of course the price will be very reasonable on the the sales side . Okay , that maybe Eddie will talk to you about uh how much uh the price and uh what's uh {disfmarker} how much its cost for the manufacturing and how much it's going to be {disfmarker} we sell in the market . Okay . Then uh you can come back with your feedback . And I I have one {disfmarker} maybe the suggestion or opinion . This remote control , okay , it can be for like universal , to use for any T_V_ . Okay , and it will be slim , okay , and uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Not fat ? project manager: Not fat . industrial designer: Not fat , huh . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Might be hard to find , though . project manager: Yep . But let's try it , okay , with the different uh {disfmarker} the designs , okay , the functional designs . marketing: Hmm . industrial designer: Oh , okay . project manager: Okay ? So any other questions ? marketing: Uh from her side , I don't think uh there's too many more questions . project manager: Okay . Thank you Christine for uh time being , marketing: If you can come to the {disfmarker} project manager: so then uh Ed , so can you tell about {disfmarker} marketing: Okay , from the marketing {disfmarker} yeah , from the marketing side , just to to give an idea what the management is looking for , I was looking for a a remote control to have a s user interface: S 'scuse me for one sec . marketing: I have a sales price of twenty-five Euro , with a production price of uh twelve and a half Euro . For what uh I think from what we're trying to find , we're tr we're looking for , I don't think that price is exactly in the market . Okay ? project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: I'll explain myself here now in the sense that uh in a {disfmarker} in the recent surveys , uh from the ages {disfmarker} fr from fifteen to thirty-five , eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Twenty-five Euros , uh that's that's a preson reasonable price . That's a market price right now . Now if we're gonna take a risk , and push this up a bit , make it more expensive , project manager: Yep . marketing: but give them added things that they don't have now , project manager: Yep . marketing: then it w it could possibly sell . Obviously the risk is there . Too expensive , they're not gonna buy . But , I think uh there's one other thing interesting {disfmarker} two things that are interesting {gap} is that uh from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group , which always spends more money on trendy new things , speech recognition is requested . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Speech recognition? . marketing: And we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Obviously , we can't make a remote into a computer , but maybe simple commands . I dunno , louder , softer , on , off . That might be a possibility , even though it costs more , to be the first on the market to produce this . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use . So we have to figure out a way of making it um more user friendly . {vocalsound} Uh fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: So maybe one word speech recognition commands , say remote , and there's a beep beep beep , and they can find it through , you know , ten tons of newspapers , magazines , whatever you have at home . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: But , in the cost that uh the management is looking for , that's not gonna be possible . But if it's trendy , if it's fancy , it's got some colour to it , if it's very easy {disfmarker} easy to use , if it's got simple remote {disfmarker} speech remote uh control , like I said , louder , softer , change channel , on , off , remote , it goes beep beep , I can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset 'cause I can't turn the T_V_ on . So we're gonna have to look at it in a {vocalsound} in this global idea , with the ideas of the industrial uh design . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: But , price obviously we have to talk about . project manager: Yep . So what do you think about uh the design {gap} ? Do you think you can make it or uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: D uh I'm sorry ? {vocalsound} project manager: What do you think about uh the design , uh what he was talking about {disfmarker} of the speech recognition ? marketing: Speech recognition . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well , uh training is always an issue with uh commands . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: So um {disfmarker} might uh {disfmarker} we can perhaps um {vocalsound} do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process , uh it could reduce th th uh the overall um cost . Not sure how . {vocalsound} But um anyway , um {vocalsound} I I think also that uh this might impact the battery life . And um so , maybe what we'll have to do is um add something where you can um recharge it wirelessly so that uh {vocalsound} y you know sen send power to it . So uh or maybe uh set it out in the sun and it uh , you know , gets uh , from the light , um a a solar cell inside there user interface: Hmm . industrial designer: so that uh you have enough uh juice to do all these fancy things . user interface: It seems also like with the speech recognition , yeah , it's a great feature , but if you're watching T_V_ , there's a lot of ambient sound , and it's words . It's not just , you know , noises like something hitting . It's actual speech , so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the T_V_ speech , and the the user's speech . Otherwise , you can say remote . industrial designer: Off . {vocalsound} user interface: But if someone on the screen is saying the same thing , all of a sudden , you have someone in a movie saying off and your screen dies , because they've triggered the remote control and it's turned off your T_V_ . {vocalsound} So , I think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems , then yeah , it'd be a really good marketing gimmick . marketing: Mm . user interface: But , I think we seriously need to consider how that would impact the situation . industrial designer: Very good point . marketing: Because tha w {vocalsound} with speech recognition uh th I'm not that good at that idea user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: but th {vocalsound} if it's a one-word recognition , 'cause I know with telephones and cars and things I've seen in the States , user interface: Yeah . marketing: {gap} a friend of mine says call Mom , and it calls up Mom . user interface: Yeah . marketing: 'Kay the radio can be on and everything . project manager: Yep . marketing: Because I think s with speech recognition , if uh the the remote or like the telephone {vocalsound} {disfmarker} it has a exact word that it has to hear . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: I don't think it would come through a sentence in a television . If somebody's speaking on the se the television , they're not gonna stop and say remote , user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: okay . So I think that uh something could be designed to recognise single word {disfmarker} user interface: Oh yeah . Yeah . No , I think it's a great idea if we can design it to to suit those requirements . marketing: Like the t like the telephone . No because I {gap} this is this is years ago in the United States where we're driving down and he said call home , and the telephone called immediately {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: so well , that's kinda cute . {vocalsound} project manager: Well , what I can uh suggest to you , Christine , okay , uh if you need some uh {disfmarker} the technical feedback , or some training , okay , about uh this facility , especially for the speech recognition , I can recommend you some companies like uh Intel or I_B_M_ , okay , because they're already in this uh speech recognition part , okay . And uh you can maybe have some uh technical backup from them , some kind of a technical tie-up . Okay , and uh if you want , I can coordinate , okay , to get some information , okay , and uh you can uh let me know , okay , so what kind of uh the details you require okay , to add this feature in this project . I don't think it's uh the difficult . And uh we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop , apart from uh what {gap} today . industrial designer: Okay , we'll find that out . project manager: Yep . marketing: From from your side uh , you're gonna have to go back the management and s be more s precise . project manager: Yes . marketing: What do they want ? project manager: Yes . marketing: Uh {vocalsound} , a risk , take a risk on the market ? Something that's gonna cost more , but could very easily s make a boom in the market ? project manager: Yes . Yep . marketing: Because it has to be something totally different , has to be total totally new . Something that nobody has right now . project manager: Yeah but marketing: And it's gonna cost . project manager: but end of the day , you're the sales guy , so I will come back and sit on your head because uh you are going to give your sales projection , marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: okay . It's uh of course it's uh good to uh tell the management how much it's cost us marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: and how much you are going to benefit , marketing: Sure . Sure . project manager: okay . And uh , so I don't mind to convince , okay , the management to spend some more money on the project , okay , if you can make out of marketing: Obviously . project manager: the money from this project . marketing: If the bottom line is positive . {vocalsound} project manager: Yes , okay I don't mind to convince the the management , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: okay . marketing: Mm . project manager: The management says , okay , so they they don't want certain facilities , which it's already worked , okay , they want something uh new , okay . I think uh like uh speech recognit definitely they will agree , I don't think they'll say no for that , okay . And uh I hope I can convince the management on that , okay . So if you have any uh new ideas , okay , for uh your {disfmarker} you can always come up and uh you can tell me if you need any uh s special , okay , coordination , okay , between any uh technical companies , which you can uh hide their technology backup , okay , for your uh functional design or technical design , okay , then I am ready to do that . And uh what's your comments about uh {disfmarker} user interface: Um well , I mean , maybe if I go through my presentation , you can sort of see what the user perspective is , and how it ties into the other two comments . marketing: Mm . project manager: Yeah , so you are finish , Ed , uh so I can uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yes . Mm . project manager: Okay , I'll uh hand over to Agnes . Just gonna close this . T Uh where are you , here ? user interface: Mm participant three . project manager: Participant three . user interface: Nope , here {gap} project manager: Okay , so I'll {disfmarker} yep . Okay . user interface: Good . project manager: Is it okay ? user interface: Thanks . project manager: Alri user interface: Yeah , and that's fine . Okay . So , basically , the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products . So , in our case , existing remote controls . And then , what the good ideas are , and what the bad ideas are , and why they're bad and good , which isn't always as obvious . We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad , but when you look , technically , at how it works , sometimes that's not the case . Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep , 'cause that'll feed into both Ed's work and Christine's work . Um and then what the remote control should look like , obviously , once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are . So , in terms of the functionalities that we need , you obviously need to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off . You need to change channels , both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing . You need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the T_V_ to regulate contrast or whatever . So , the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls , in general . The buttons {disfmarker} it's not clear what they're supposed to do . Um often , you need to know specific button sequences {vocalsound} to get certain functionalities done , um which you don't necessarily always remember , especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often . And that the buttons are too small . So , here we've got two examples where here on the left-hand side , you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: The buttons , in a lot of cases , are tiny . Um they're hard to see , and okay , they're labelled , but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much . Whereas , on the other side , you have a much simpler remote control that I think basically has the minimum functionalities {vocalsound} that are needed . And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it . So , I would be inclined to go sort of towards this , in terms of design , rather than this . And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons . So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit , or to a minimum , sorry , make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , so like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume , and to keep the design basically sleek and simple . project manager: Click mm . user interface: Which , I think ties into what Christine and Ed have both said fairly reasonably . Um so , that's pretty much it , an I don't know if you guys have any questions or {disfmarker} industrial designer: Oh , it's um , seems {vocalsound} very understandable . Clearly your research and uh {disfmarker} and ours uh heading in the same direction , user interface: Yep . industrial designer: and um uh the only thing that I saw missing from uh your your research that we found was this uh ability to find the doggone thing when you need it . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Yes , that's true . Yeah . industrial designer: So uh , you know , but that's okay . That's why we're all here at the table , so that if we think of it and our research indicates certain things and um w we it's complementary . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: I also think that um uh th f the the feel of it is uh , when you hold it , is something that um uh was expressed more in in in in my uh design user interface: Mm-hmm . Yeah . industrial designer: and that's logical and normal 'cause those are the parameters that an Industrial Designer's more thinking about , th th the look and the feel , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and uh , you're {disfmarker} user interface: Oh , that's definitely a very important factor , especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost on an {disfmarker} daily basis in a lot of cases , I think . industrial designer: First . Yep . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Okay , so I don't have any questions . Sounds good . project manager: So {vocalsound} for anybody need uh any help , for time being , on this uh subjects , okay , so please come back to me , user interface: Oh {disfmarker} project manager: and uh Christine , maybe I can uh try to help you to get some uh the technical uh the companies to help you for uh make a design uh slim , okay , and to add some features , like we are talking about , the speech recognition and all . user interface: Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include , project manager: Yeah . user interface: 'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table , but do we actually want to incorporate all of them , or have we missed anything ? marketing: Hmm . industrial designer: Do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide , maybe that would provide some guidance ? user interface: Sure . industrial designer: Doesn't really tell us . project manager: So not really this one we are talk ab marketing: Individual actions . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well it says individual actions , project manager: Yep . industrial designer: it says user interf so I'm supposed to do the components concept , supposed to work on the user interface concept , user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: and you're supposed to keep watching the trends . Um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach . I think we should {vocalsound} do as many features as uh {disfmarker} start with all of them right now user interface: I thought {disfmarker} industrial designer: and eliminate them later in the process , that's my suggestion . project manager: Okay , that will be great . {vocalsound} And uh I'll send you the the minutes of meet industrial designer: {vocalsound} You can object if you want to {vocalsound} user interface: No , I I'm just thinking in terms of time , marketing: {vocalsound} She's objecting . {vocalsound} user interface: like if {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} Yes , now I'm objecting . No , I mean , I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away ? I mean , it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features , um and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use , maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting , marketing: Oh th {vocalsound} we s we still have {disfmarker} user interface: guess {disfmarker} industrial designer: 'cause w our meeting time has run out . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Somebody else has go to use this room , marketing: Right . user interface: Sure . industrial designer: and , you know , we can't hang out here user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and talk about this , so {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . Sure . project manager: Okay , what we'll do is now we'll take for lunch break , okay , then uh we can discuss furthermore , okay , with our areas , and uh then we will come back again in the {disfmarker} in the next meeting . So thanks for coming and uh I'll send you minutes of meeting , and uh please put your all information in the sharing folder so everybody can share the information . Okay ? user interface: Okay . project manager: So let's go for lunch then . Thank you . industrial designer: Thank you very much . marketing: Agreed . {vocalsound}
