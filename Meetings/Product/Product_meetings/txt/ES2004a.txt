user interface: Hmm hmm hmm . project manager: {vocalsound} Are we {disfmarker} we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay , that's fine . Am I supposed to be standing up there ? Okay . marketing: So we've got both of these clipped on ? She gonna answer me or not ? project manager: Yeah , I've got {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Right , both of them , okay . project manager: Yes . marketing: God . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Jesus , it's gonna fall off {gap} . user interface: Okay . Yep , yep . {vocalsound} Okay . Tu tu tu tu project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Hello everybody . user interface: Hi , good morning . project manager: Um I'm Sarah , the Project Manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough . Okay , this is our agenda , um {vocalsound} we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . Um then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as I can understand . Now , we're developing a remote control which you probably already know . Um , we want it to be original , something that's uh {disfmarker} people haven't thought of , that's not out in the shops , um , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it . Okay , um , first is the functional design , um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , um what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that . Um , conceptual design , what we're thinking , how it's gonna go and then the detailed design , how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work . user interface: 'Kay . project manager: Okay , right . We're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , I'll go first , and um sum up the characteristics of that animal . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: So {disfmarker} user interface: Oops . project manager: Okay , I'll leave space for everyone else . Um {disfmarker} What's missing ? We're running out of blue . Okay . I'm not gonna ask you to guess , I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger . user interface: Mm . project manager: And I see them as majestic , and independent , and proud . user interface: Oh sorry . Mm-hmm . project manager: Now , who would like to go next ? user interface: Yeah , me . project manager: 'Kay . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {gap} Cat . Where did this come from ? project manager: Is that your lapel then ? user interface: Uh , yep . project manager: There you go . user interface: Thank you . Uh , maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make ? marketing: A kind of dog ? project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yep . It's actually sitting , so {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} It's sitting down . marketing: Sorry ? user interface: it's sitting , it's not standing . marketing: Uh . user interface: Okay , I see it as one thing it's very supportive . It's your best friend and your {disfmarker} you can talk to a dog , it can be your best friend , it doesn't discriminate between you , based on what you are . Second it's loyal and third thing it's got intuition . {gap} dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: so basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog . project manager: Okay , thank you . user interface: Thank you . industrial designer: Yeah I'll have a go . user interface: Okay . Sorry . industrial designer: Thanks . marketing: Please , please leave me a space at the bottom , I'm little , project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Alright , okay . marketing: you can get to the top , with standing on a chair . industrial designer: Well since you guys have chosen the ones I wanted to do , I'll have to have to go for something a bit random . user interface: {vocalsound} Does it look like a dog actually ? project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: And also , my drawing skill isn't that great so , yeah . project manager: Well , as you can see , the quality of the work today is um {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Mm . marketing: I think it's outstandingly good . {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay , now I'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: because that looks like a beak now , so . {vocalsound} Yeah , it can be a crocodile , it can be a crocodile . marketing: Crocodile ? project manager: Gonna be a bird . Is it gonna be {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well it was it was an {disfmarker} at first {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} it's gonna be a bird . industrial designer: firstly it was an attempt at a T_ Rex and then it sort of changed into a pelican marketing: O industrial designer: but it can be a crocodile now actually {vocalsound} . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} That's lovely . industrial designer: Yeah and uh I'll have to think on the spot of uh things that it is . Um marketing: Beauti that's {disfmarker} industrial designer: uh scary , uh strong , yeah that's about it I think {vocalsound} . project manager: Okay {vocalsound} it's fine . marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . Um , I'm very impressed with your artistic skills , industrial designer: Uh uh {disfmarker} marketing: mine's {disfmarker} are dreadful . Oops this is now coming apart , let me just put the top in . industrial designer: Wo {vocalsound} marketing: I hope that clicks in , I'll just {disfmarker} I'll hold it on , okay . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Oops , oh dear , what happened there ? project manager: Technical help . industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: Hopefully that'll stay on , two-handed version . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Okay , uh {disfmarker} Again this is off the top of my head , I was gonna do a big cat too , um . industrial designer: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Hmm . marketing: Oh dear , it doesn't look what like what I want it to be {vocalsound} . industrial designer: S Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Uh . industrial designer: {gap} marketing: It's not a vampire bat honestly {vocalsound} . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay , yeah . marketing: Uh and somewhere there's a body behind . industrial designer: Okay , some sort of bird {vocalsound} marketing: That's my dreadful {disfmarker} that's the worst yet , that's {disfmarker} it's meant to be an eagle {vocalsound} project manager: A seagu user interface: Eagle , okay . project manager: right , industrial designer: Ah eagle , right okay . project manager: not a seagull {vocalsound} . marketing: you can tell it's a flying animal {vocalsound} could have been a seagull , I never thought of a seagull . An eagle , um again I'm thinking on my feet goodness . I suppose they're all so independent , I'd put that one down again . {vocalsound} Da dum um . industrial designer: They're good at golf . marketing: Indepen independent , right , did you say they're good at golf ? project manager: {vocalsound} Eagle . industrial designer: Yeah , no yeah , marketing: Are they ? industrial designer: an eagle . marketing: Oh . Oh right , okay , project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: I'm not good at golf . industrial designer: {gap} {vocalsound} marketing: I'd say they're quite free-spirited , flying around everywhere , doing their own thing . And uh , birds of prey aren't they , project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: oh dear , intrepid . I'll put that , intrepid . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: There we go , project manager: That's lovely . marketing: hope that pen's gonna be okay . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Whoops . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . That was fun , right . Um finance-wise , we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros , which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds , at all . Any ideas ? industrial designer: It's about {disfmarker} user interface: One point four or something like that . industrial designer: mm , mm yeah . marketing: Seventeen . user interface: One point four Euro would make a Pound or something like that . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah , something like that , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: so that {disfmarker} project manager: D fifteen ? industrial designer: yeah about seventeen , seventeen Pounds , something like that . project manager: Seventeen . marketing: Seventeen Pounds . project manager: Okay , that's expensive . marketing: Should we be making notes of this ? We can just refer to this later can't we ? project manager: I think so , I think so , industrial designer: But {disfmarker} project manager: I'll be able to um pull it up , marketing: Yeah , okay . project manager: or I could put it in the shared folder or something . industrial designer: Havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those {disfmarker} the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: So , it'd still be {disfmarker} project manager: Really ? marketing: Right . industrial designer: yeah , we had to buy one {vocalsound} . marketing: So project manager: Mm . I think {disfmarker} marketing: so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option ? project manager: Yeah , um production cost's at twelve fifty , so industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: Okay , pretty huge margin . project manager: half of the selling price is taken up by building it . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm . project manager: Um , and profit aim is fifty million Euros , marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: which is uh {disfmarker} marketing: In our first year ? project manager: Yi yes , um yeah , I presume so . Um {disfmarker} marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: So then {disfmarker} marketing: You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a {disfmarker} um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone project manager: No , yeah . marketing: {disfmarker} user-friendly to everyone . Okay . project manager: So {disfmarker} marketing: Big target group {vocalsound} . project manager: yes , yes , I don't think we have to {disfmarker} I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , um making that a key point , marketing: No . project manager: just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that . marketing: Mm . project manager: Okay . What are your experiences with remote controls ? I mean I've got {disfmarker} we got um {disfmarker} we had three videos , a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Alright . user interface: that c project manager: but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again . I think it was quite a cheapie as well , so that might have had something to do with it , industrial designer: Yeah uh . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: but that was quite good , the fact that you could {disfmarker} You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you . industrial designer: Use all the ones at the same time . marketing: Right . user interface: Okay , you wanna integrate everything into one like {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: Okay . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: 'cause you {disfmarker} marketing: My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things . But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , project manager: Mm . marketing: I don't think I could go any further with it than that , so , I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well . project manager: Yeah , the main {disfmarker} that's the main stuff anyway , I mean marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: {disfmarker} and you don't want to {disfmarker} I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do marketing: Mm . project manager: and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm . And symbols that you don't necessarily understand , project manager: Yeah . marketing: symbols you're meant to understand that you don't . user interface: So simplification of symbols you could think of . project manager: {vocalsound} Um . When they're {disfmarker} when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it . marketing: Oh yeah . Mm-hmm . project manager: 'Cause it doesn't make {disfmarker} when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at , marketing: Mm . project manager: it's obvious what you're doing , um . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display , user interface: Mm-hmm . Menu , alright . marketing: I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Uh uh {disfmarker} marketing: so you've got a little L_C_D_ display . user interface: Right , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus . marketing: With menus , yeah , yeah . user interface: And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe . marketing: Yeah . project manager: What about the older generation ? What about granny and grandads ? user interface: {vocalsound} You mean to save it lesser number . project manager: Um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ? user interface: Right . project manager: I don't think they tape things , industrial designer: Yeah , my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so {vocalsound} project manager: I don't think they use {disfmarker} marketing: Right . Right . So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps , project manager: Mm , yeah , the age gap . industrial designer: Yeah , what it just needs to be {disfmarker} as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing , 'cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do . project manager: Mm . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: I don't know , I d industrial designer: But I don't know how {disfmarker} project manager: I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system . industrial designer: Oh yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: I find it really confusing , I kept getting lost {vocalsound} in the phone , I di I've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one marketing: Right . project manager: and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , but that's just me . industrial designer: Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume . marketing: Mm-hmm . Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ? user interface: Okay . project manager: Teletext has got that option as well . marketing: Obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing . project manager: Yeah . Or what about kind of a dual function ? In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: and also {disfmarker} and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm . The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is {disfmarker} you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Mm , okay . S project manager: I think that's a cost thing , I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about {disfmarker} industrial designer: Y user interface: It might marketing: Yeah ? user interface: it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yes , no that's important . user interface: But it might have its cost implications . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , like smaller . project manager: Okay . marketing: And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ? project manager: Mm . user interface: Right . marketing: Something that's easily moulded and produced . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Um , right , okay industrial designer: No uh uh {disfmarker} project manager: we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things . Um I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation . industrial designer: Yeah . Just just a quick thing about the um {vocalsound} project manager: Sure . industrial designer: about what you're saying about the uh {disfmarker} does does it need to be fashionable ? The sort of {disfmarker} I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh {disfmarker} we put the fashion into electronics , so I think think the whole design thing might be qui marketing: Ah right . user interface: Okay . project manager: Okay . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: I mean you don't {disfmarker} you you can still have plastic marketing: Sure b y yeah . industrial designer: and it'd look quite good but {disfmarker} marketing: But {disfmarker} yeah , I mean it doesn't have to be that , you know {vocalsound} th that was my main point , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: we don't have to use metal , I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper , project manager: Mm . marketing: I presume it would . project manager: I would {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager: it would probably . I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything . They're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter , marketing: Right . project manager: so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about . marketing: Okay . project manager: Okay , so let's break it up there . Okay ? industrial designer: Okay . marketing: 'Kay . project manager: So , see you in half an hour . marketing: Do we go back to our room ? Yep ? user interface: Mm , yeah . project manager: I think so , yeah .
