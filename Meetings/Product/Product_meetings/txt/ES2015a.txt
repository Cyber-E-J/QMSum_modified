And uh tool training is one thing that we're going to be doing today , um um as well as planning the project , how we're going to , uh , create this product , and , um , discuss , um , our aims and objects of this , Which brings us to our next subject , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: is , um , um , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control . Um , we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy , um , a completely new style , so that , um , can really appeal to a , to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of , uh , channel-changer . And , um , it needs to be user-friendly for , um , maybe , for an example , for people that , um , can't see the numbers as well , or , um , perhaps an ergonomic design . industrial designer: Okay . So this is a television remote control ? project manager: Yes , it's a television remote control . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Right . I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now . So , alright . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Um , yeah . Um , the way that we're going to go about this is , um , we'll have a time where we can , um come up with new ideas alone , and , and work on the project and then , um , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in a meeting and , and discuss what , what um , what kind of functional design we want to use . Same with conceptual design and detailed design . So , um , making sure that it , it's usable , that as a , um {disfmarker} and that it's , it's feasible to create , and uh , to come up with a concept of it want , what we want it to look like . Um , tool training . Is , is everyone , um {disfmarker} {gap} Okay . industrial designer: Yeah . Got those notes . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Great .

And , um , as a sort of team-building moment , um , I , I'd like us to , um , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Um , why that , why that should be your favourite animal . So , um , I , I'm assuming that we should do that now . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: 'Kay . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} With our microphones still attached to our bodies . Okay . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Gosh . {vocalsound} project manager: 'Kay , what's my favourite animal ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Do come up . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Oh , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {gap} to go first . {vocalsound} Oh , project manager: This is a team-building time industrial designer: are we all doing it individually ? user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: where , um , {vocalsound} , industrial designer: Okay , let's stand up and support you {vocalsound} project manager: okay cool , um {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: My favourite animal , which changes all the time , okay , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: right now it is an elk . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay . user interface: An elk ? marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: alright , so {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} A vicious {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: And it goes like {disfmarker} Yeah it's got like big antlers , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: yeah . Looks kinda like , like it has holly growing out of its head . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Do you have elk where you come from ? project manager: Yes . industrial designer: You do . project manager: Yeah marketing: We have moose too . {vocalsound} project manager: we have moose and we have deer . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Do you have {disfmarker} user interface: We have sheep . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} {gap} 'Kay , um . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Sheep . Yeah , marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: cows . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: That's a great elk . marketing: Uh-oh , we have a good artist . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: That is really good . project manager: {vocalsound} Thanks . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: I'm quite {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: This is my {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Oh , very shapely . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Brilliant . project manager: That's a sketching of my my elk , and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: that um , that um {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: In a way it looks kind of awkward , because it's on spindly legs and it uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: But it can really overcome harsh terrain , and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous , because it has um strong antlers , and uh it can really combat its enemies , even like it it's a it's an herbivore but , uh , it can really defend itself . industrial designer: Mm . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Very nice . Okay . project manager: Right . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Right , I'm gonna take minutes while , um , you guys express your favourite animals . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay , I'll go next . I am a big animal lover . like all sorts of animals , but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Oh . project manager: Oh . industrial designer: It's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing , but never mind . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Not as artistic as Heather's drawing . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Bit more cartoon style . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: But I like cats because they're so independent , and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing . Um , but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable , 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well , and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , um , running around outside as well as being inside , and enjoying their food , and generally just , they just seemed so cool and {vocalsound} they just know what they're doing . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh I reckon they're sort of , they got it sorted . They know what they want . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Basically , that's why I like cats . {vocalsound} user interface: Very good . {vocalsound} project manager: Great . industrial designer: {gap} I'll rub that out . There you go . {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . I think my favourite animal would be a dog , but I'm not really sure {vocalsound} how to draw one . industrial designer: Ooh . user interface: I , I've never drawn a dog , I don't think . I'm tempted to draw a snail 'cause I draw them sometimes {vocalsound} and they're really easy to draw . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Um , project manager: I forget her name . user interface: right it's gonna be a really funny dog , 'cause I'm not sure how to draw a dog . marketing: Tara project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: or Tara . industrial designer: Well there are loads of different types of dogs , so I'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} It's a cartoon dog I think . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: A s I don't ev Oh , oh well . {vocalsound} It's a scary cartoon dog . That {disfmarker} This , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: that does not look like a dog . project manager: {vocalsound} It looks kinda like a person . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} We can pretend . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} I'm sorry . marketing: {vocalsound} That's Pinocchio . user interface: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} How do you draw a dog ? I suppose it has a lon Oh my god . Right . Yous know what it's supposed to be . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} It's a dog . {vocalsound} . Um , I like dogs because , um , they're so good to humans , like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs , and they're just such friendly animals . And , like they're more of a companion than cats . industrial designer: Yeah , that's true . user interface: {vocalsound} I've nothing against cats . Cats don't really like me , so I can't like them . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} But they're just so friendly and warm and nice animals , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} that don't look like that . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Alrighty . I feel like a robot . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . Um , well I guess I had the most time to think about it . I'm going to draw a butterfly , because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving . And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild , and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland . It was like , well it was a little pointier than that . At first I thought it was a dead leaf . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: And then it landed on the wall next to me . But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this . And then it kinda {disfmarker} there was a green , I think it was a green ring , and there was like red going out like this . project manager: It's kinda like a peacock . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , it kinda was actually , 'cause it was {disfmarker} This part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and I'm like , wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: So I thought that was pretty cool . And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . I wish I'd had my camera . So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here . Yeah . industrial designer: Very nice . {vocalsound} marketing: There you go . project manager: Great . marketing: {vocalsound} Uh , what do we {disfmarker} Oh . project manager: Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ? marketing: Yes I do . {vocalsound} {gap} project manager: Yea {vocalsound} Right . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , industrial designer: Okay . project manager: um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , um {disfmarker} or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we'll be looking at , um , wanna make this um {gap} selling price of twenty five Euros . And so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um we can {disfmarker} like the price to create it will be significantly less . Um , we'd like to , um to , uh , make fifty million Euro . I'm assuming that's what the M_ means . Um , and make it for an international market . Um , one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , um , like different kinds of , uh , V_C_R_s . Things like that , depending on which country you are . Another thing for the design team to think about . Um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents . marketing: Okay , so we'll have a hundred percent profit then ? Twelve fifty . project manager: I'm bad at math . marketing: Okay . project manager: 'Kay . {vocalsound} Um , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: so now that , um , that is underway , um industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: it is discussion time . So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any um suggestions that you may have so far , a um your personal experiences with remote controls , and um , um , areas you see that , uh , could be improved in your experience with them . Does anyone have any initial thoughts ? marketing: I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing . project manager: Mm-hmm . So what's something we could , uh , do to remedy that ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: It's always , where is the remote control ? user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking {vocalsound} device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I dunno , some kind of alarm . You can press a button on your wall , {gap} signal , project manager: Yeah . It's a great idea . It's a great idea . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: 'cause it always gets lost . user interface: Do yous not find that , um , {vocalsound} like , there's a lot of , um , buttons on your remote control , and you don't know what half of them do . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah , that you don't use half of them . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , I don't know what they do . {vocalsound} marketing: Mm-hmm . There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , that's , that's {disfmarker} marketing: That's useful . industrial designer: Yeah , it is . Yeah . marketing: So you just have like the number buttons , power button , T_V_ video button . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Alright . Anything about , um , the look of the , uh , remote control that you might have ideas about . Maybe it could be , instead of like a standard rectangular shape , it could be , um , something more interesting like {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Any ideas will do that you have at this point . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Could be shaped like a conch , project manager: {vocalsound} Can hold it . industrial designer: {vocalsound} A novelty . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: you know . Be like a shell-shaped remote . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Are we going into kind of novelty factors here . Like , I've seen phones like a {disfmarker} project manager: Well if it's a trendy original , um , aspect we're going for . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: I mean , you're the designers , you c , you can um decide what kind of , um , direction you wanna go in , industrial designer: Yeah . Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . project manager: but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there . industrial designer: Yeah . I suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . Like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: But we don't wanna go towards boring , 'cause that wouldn't sell either . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: So , hmm . project manager: And the key issue here is , is being trendy and original . Um , that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: Right . Okay we have five minutes left . So , just to cover {disfmarker} We have one more thing . Um , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times . Um , our next meeting will be in half an hour . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So you have half an hour to , uh , think about what you want to present . Or not present but bring to the meeting . Um , I_D_ , whatever that stands for . industrial designer: Industrial Designer . marketing: Interface ? project manager: Industrial Designer . industrial designer: That's me . {vocalsound} marketing: Oh , industrial . project manager: I have to remember these things . Um . You'll be beginning your , your working design . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Um , U_I_D_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . Um , {vocalsound} maybe how this can be achieved , and , um , we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert . marketing: Marketing Expert . {vocalsound} project manager: Um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour . And I'll see you in half an hour , okay ? industrial designer: Okay . project manager: 'Kay . industrial designer: Thank you . user interface: {gap}
