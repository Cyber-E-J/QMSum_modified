industrial designer: {vocalsound} I'm proud of it . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . And again I'll take minutes . The {disfmarker} what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . user interface: Yeah . marketing: It does look very cool . project manager: Um then industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . So we've got forty minutes . S marketing: And then do we get to make a remote control ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} 'Cause we missed out . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: So industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: it's now {disfmarker} I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen . industrial designer: Uh-huh . How how much do we have , forty minutes ? project manager: Is that right ? user interface: Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: until about four fifteen . So yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay , so . project manager: Go for it . Do you want {disfmarker} user interface: So , you said um {disfmarker} are are we starting with the the {disfmarker} project manager: Yes . industrial designer: Presentation . user interface: so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} You think bananas are a safe thing to use ? project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: It's a bit um phallic . industrial designer: Yeah . Um {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Well , but it's it's just an a approximation . {vocalsound} project manager: Dual use , perfect . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Dual use , perfect . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Oh , {vocalsound} {gap} your remote control ? Oh that's just bad . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again . project manager: Sorry , sorry . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So now we we have the {disfmarker} okay , project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . And we have the user interface o in here project manager: Mm-hmm . Wow . industrial designer: and uh {vocalsound} the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . Um well , everything else is probably user interface , so . Yeah , yeah . project manager: And it's {disfmarker} the whole thing's made of rubber , is that {disfmarker} user interface: Uh yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah . user interface: Rubber . marketing: Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ? user interface: Yeah , {gap} . Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be {gap} and {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , user interface: so we said the back side round , yeah . industrial designer: well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . I I think it's it's uh {disfmarker} project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: It l does look like the {gap} curvy user interface: Yeah . marketing: and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Mm . Hmm . user interface: Yeah . And it's spongy as well . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: So {vocalsound} so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the {vocalsound} on the cover we just have the very basic things . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Huh . Mm-hmm . user interface: So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three {disfmarker} there would be numbers in in the {disfmarker} on the actual one . project manager: Yeah . user interface: So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here . project manager: {vocalsound} Six seven eight nine . I like that . user interface: Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly . project manager: Yeah . user interface: And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and {disfmarker} like the previous one and the next one . project manager: Uh-huh . user interface: And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next . marketing: So where's the volume ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: The volume is is scrolling . industrial designer: It's on the side . user interface: On the side , marketing: Ah , you did get that in then , user interface: this one . Yeah you just do it like this . marketing: mm-hmm . user interface: And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here . marketing: Oh okay , {gap} . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: See ? So the volume is {vocalsound} you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , {vocalsound} okay , there there you have the screen project manager: Yeah . user interface: and and you have the mm {vocalsound} spinning wheel with options to choose . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Cool . Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Uh no , we we'd not put {gap} {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: A mute button . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials . user interface: Well , {gap} we'll have this on the screen , on the display . project manager: Y or you could have it {disfmarker} so you {disfmarker} on the wheel if you {disfmarker} marketing: On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute . industrial designer: Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options . user interface: Well , but the but the mute {disfmarker} yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ? project manager: But if you hold it in , industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ? project manager: if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ? marketing: Okay , cool . user interface: Okay , yeah , okay . marketing: So that {gap} that solves the whole mute issue . industrial designer: Mm . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it . project manager: {gap} no . user interface: You can't really see it in the interface . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , it's hidden in there somewhere . user interface: Yeah . And we do have the logo on it as well . project manager: Mm-hmm , very good . user interface: So I think it {disfmarker} project manager: And it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {gap} . industrial designer: Cool . user interface: Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} We ran out of resources here , so . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . user interface: In the actual one . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: You can have a look . {vocalsound} user interface: So if you have questions . project manager: Very good , let's have a look . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Test it out . {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess . marketing: Yeah , oh , we hold the remote . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: I hate Play-Do , it's just minging . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: But yeah , uh that's cool , cool . project manager: Very good . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria marketing: Okay . project manager: and then we'll there {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , see the budget . project manager: I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: and cut some of the prices that way . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Wales . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Wales , for example . {vocalsound} marketing: Mm . Cool , okay . Right , okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Fabulous , project manager: Marketing Expert . marketing: yeah . Okay , cool . So what we're gonna do is prefer {disfmarker} prepare the evaluation of the new design . {vocalsound} Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale , project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . Um , you know . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them . Um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like {disfmarker} so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Okay ? project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Cool , so these are what they are . Oh {disfmarker} project manager: So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . Is that right ? marketing: Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . project manager: Mm dots , never mind . marketing: Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , the yeah , it's definitely attractive . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , I agree . user interface: Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot . marketing: Well , I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ? project manager: Yeah , just prepare one now . user interface: Yeah . Shall I just prepare it now ? marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: It will be red , too . marketing: Cool . Okay . So , be attractive to look at . That's this one . What do you all say ? industrial designer: So ? project manager: I reckon it {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} S seven was th the maximum , yeah ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: I I go for seven . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yes . marketing: Oh {vocalsound} we're all so proud of the {gap} . project manager: Seven , yeah , it's terribly sexy . Yeah . marketing: Okay , so that'll be a seven for A_ . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Could {disfmarker} oh no , you can't whilst that's up there . Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in . project manager: Ah , okay . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Excellent . Except we can't {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: But we can we can {disfmarker} marketing: But that's alright . project manager: uh we can if we {disfmarker} industrial designer: I can I can take note uh uh {disfmarker} marketing: If you take a note of them , and then I'll put them in in a minute . project manager: then yeah , I'll take a note , it's fine . marketing: Okay , so {vocalsound} we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: Cool , okay . Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? industrial designer: Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , project manager: I think it does . user interface: I would think yes , yeah . marketing: Yeah . I mean {disfmarker} industrial designer: so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger . user interface: Yeah , project manager: Alright . user interface: so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m {vocalsound} model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . marketing: Yeah . project manager: But that's gonna be a problem , industrial designer: But then {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So bu it's it's not a huge problem , marketing: I th I think it's not {vocalsound} it's not like it's a pen . industrial designer: because i i it is operatable . user interface: But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , project manager: Yeah . user interface: so they just {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , but I mean because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , user interface: Yeah . marketing: but they can normally do most things right-handed , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Right . marketing: so I would say it's not such a big issue . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah , because I mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb . project manager: Yeah . user interface: so i if the majority are right-handed , it's uh {disfmarker} project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yep . marketing: So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: So maybe we need to put {disfmarker} that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ? project manager: Um {disfmarker} marketing: What do you what do you all think ? industrial designer: Mm . project manager: Six . user interface: Or maybe six , because it's just one one i one among the issues , project manager: Yeah , I think I think for um {disfmarker} user interface: I mean . Yeah . project manager: I mean most people are right-handed , so in {vocalsound} in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want {disfmarker} might want to um {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: One more thing is that i marketing: Okay . industrial designer: It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , project manager: They {disfmarker} industrial designer: so it opens on the side . So {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: No , yeah , but mm but we have it {vocalsound} nicely {vocalsound} with the hinges here {gap} yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah yeah , I mean {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: So it won't be a problem , marketing: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: So you guys can decide wh whether {disfmarker} user interface: it will be {disfmarker} and it will be {disfmarker} it won't be heavy . industrial designer: Oops . marketing: I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top . industrial designer: Yeah , but we {disfmarker} which makes it kind of really big , yeah . user interface: Yeah well yeah , project manager: The length is gonna be difficu user interface: but it's it's a bit long . It's a little bit long . marketing: Yeah um {disfmarker} user interface: Well , I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah . marketing: But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Uh this this kind of uh makes it more {gap} project manager: Mm . marketing: Because {disfmarker} user interface: S uh slightly smaller . industrial designer: and two , it might interfere with the I_R_ channel . marketing: So you have to keep that side flat . user interface: Yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work . industrial designer: Right . Okay . marketing: Okay . Um {vocalsound} okay , so C_ . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ? industrial designer: No , we have a locator . project manager: No , we're gonna put it like {disfmarker} we've got th there's the locator dot . marketing: There's a locator . Cool , so that means you need a {disfmarker} that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , user interface: Mm that you stick on T_V_ . project manager: Mm . marketing: doesn't it ? To make it beep . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Or a buzzer . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to mm to do some {disfmarker} to make some sounds , so {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So that's two , so that's seven , yeah . It's locatable ? user interface: Yep . marketing: Fabulous . D_ . industrial designer: Intuitive , completely intuitive . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . If {vocalsound} uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things project manager: Yeah . user interface: and it's {disfmarker} I th I think it's {disfmarker} project manager: I'd say six , 'cause the {disfmarker} I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . I really like the way you have it , marketing: Yeah . project manager: but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to . industrial designer: Intuitive . marketing: Yeah , and I mean d industrial designer: And uh even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology project manager: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni project manager: Might be {disfmarker} industrial designer: so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it . project manager: But it {disfmarker} and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: So , should we maybe say f a five industrial designer: So l marketing: and say it is intuitive , project manager: Five ? marketing: but it's different , so , do you know , I mean it's obvious how to use it , project manager: Yeah . marketing: but you might have to think about it first . So we give that one a five , you think ? industrial designer: Yeah , okay . I'm gonna give a seven in everything , so . {vocalsound} marketing: Yep . project manager: I'm happy with five ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: I'm glad you're accepting this . It has taken a little while , hasn't it ? Um intuitive but {disfmarker} Sorry , it's really hard to write on those . industrial designer: Mm . {vocalsound} marketing: I just went a bit mad , didn't I ? project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Um okay , cool , E_ , okay . Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . Investigate . project manager: Yep . But otherwise it's superb . marketing: So , should we give it a six ? project manager: Six . marketing: Six ? user interface: Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . user interface: well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things , industrial designer: {gap} . user interface: but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah , unless you are a all the time sitting . user interface: yeah ? See . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , so it's kinda {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic . marketing: I used to send fifty texts a day , you know , project manager: Well we've banned them from {disfmarker} marketing: and I never got repetitive strain injury from that , project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm yeah . marketing: so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest . industrial designer: And moreover it it has um {vocalsound} L_C_D_ and everything , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , it's varied . marketing: Okay , so we give that a six , project manager: Yeah . Six ? marketing: yeah . Okay , F_ . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker} it does have {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Absolutely . project manager: Voice control have seven . marketing: Hang on , how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? That's just {disfmarker} project manager: Ah , that's the second one . So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide . marketing: Oh okay , cool . Um {vocalsound} right , so {vocalsound} . industrial designer: So it has voice control . marketing: Yes , so that's a seven then . industrial designer: Yep . marketing: Um , cool . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: G_ technologically innovative . industrial designer: Anyway it ha yeah , user interface: Technologi {gap} well {disfmarker} industrial designer: it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} But in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new . user interface: Yeah . Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is {disfmarker} yeah , it's kind of new . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , but I mean you don't {disfmarker} project manager: All of the components have been used in other things before . industrial designer: Yeah , but they've been brought together in a remote . user interface: But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new . marketing: They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think . project manager: But do {disfmarker} yeah , yeah . Yeah . marketing: {gap} . project manager: What do you reckon , five , six ? marketing: Yeah , what do you all think ? user interface: Six . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: Six ? user interface: I mean how how far can you go with a remote control , really ? project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Well , that's it , I mean {disfmarker} user interface: It still has to do what i what it has to do . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ? project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: So , I don't think many peop project manager: Space remote . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: That's it , they can take it with them . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Put fashion in electronics . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Absolutely . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , isn't it fashionable ? project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: The carrot banana remote . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , sure . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: It's the maximum fashion . marketing: So , we give it seven , and we write {disfmarker} user interface: Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: There we go . industrial designer: I think that's a {gap} . user interface: So I think we've done very well , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Cool . project manager: Very good . user interface: {vocalsound} What's the assessment ? marketing: So , we need the average here , so we got {disfmarker} user interface: The average is about six and something . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , one . user interface: A little bit over six . marketing: Seven {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} There are how many sixes ? project manager: Or a seven {vocalsound} . industrial designer: One , two , three . marketing: So we've got four sevens , user interface: No , wait , a little bit under six . marketing: so that's twenty eight , industrial designer: Three . user interface: No , wait . marketing: three sixes , industrial designer: And one five . marketing: eighteen . user interface: Oh , three sixes , okay , yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . industrial designer: Okay , twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six . Forty six and five , fifty one . project manager: Six point point {disfmarker} industrial designer: Fifty one divided by {disfmarker} user interface: Six point something , yeah . marketing: Two three four {disfmarker} Seven eight . project manager: about six point five . user interface: {vocalsound} Six point five , yeah . project manager: Close enough . marketing: Okay , that's pretty good , I think . {vocalsound} project manager: Now wait until we {vocalsound} get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: That's all you've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ? marketing: Um no , that's it , project manager: That's it ? marketing: yeah . project manager: Alright . So , finance . And we'll see if we can unscrew this first . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Cool , there we go . project manager: Sorry , this is {disfmarker} I'm just um {disfmarker} marketing: {gap} . There we go and there are the marks . project manager: Beautiful . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Not anymore . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Computer no signal ? industrial designer: Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit . project manager: Adjusting . There we go . Okay , so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . And now we have to calculate the production costs . So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that . Can you read that ? Almost . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: More or less . Um I started filling it in , but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . No hand dynamo , right ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: One simple battery . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: Mm . project manager: No kinetic energy , no solar . The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print . industrial designer: Advanced , yeah . project manager: We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker . user interface: Yep . project manager: Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it . user interface: Yeah , yes . project manager: Case material we said rubber . user interface: Rubber . industrial designer: Yep . project manager: I don't know what special colour means . industrial designer: Mm anything uh I think which is not more {gap} . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: I think something coloured , yeah , probably . So I think this is probably special co no ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: It could be {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know . project manager: Rub rubber comes coloured , user interface: Yeah . project manager: it's {disfmarker} I would {disfmarker} {vocalsound} maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different . user interface: Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , project manager: Yeah , let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . {vocalsound} user interface: {gap} yeah yeah , okay . marketing: Yeah , user interface: Yeah . marketing: you might end up having to take off the sample sensor . project manager: We we're definitely going to have to {disfmarker} user interface: We have pushbuttons , industrial designer: Mm . project manager: so we've got pushbutton , and then we've user interface: scro we have scroll wheel as well . project manager: Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? industrial designer: No uh we we have uh yeah . user interface: S yeah , yeah , we had , for muting , yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: And we have L_C_ display project manager: And button supplements . user interface: and {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: Mm no . user interface: Um {disfmarker} marketing: {gap} . No . industrial designer: We don't have {disfmarker} project manager: No . No ? industrial designer: we're not using any of that . user interface: Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel {disfmarker} project manager: But the the spinning wheel's not there . I have {disfmarker} think {disfmarker} maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: We've got more than one pushbutton though , user interface: Okay , let's {gap} yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: haven't we ? project manager: I think the pushbutton {disfmarker} oh . marketing: 'Cause then you have {disfmarker} project manager: I don't know if that's one {disfmarker} marketing: That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget . project manager: Yeah . That seems unlikely . industrial designer: Huh ? project manager: Push what uh industrial designer: Wh wh what is the limit ? Uh . marketing: Twelve point five . project manager: whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we {disfmarker} user interface: We have to count all of them , or {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: Mm I don't think so , no . project manager: I don't think that makes sense . marketing: No . industrial designer: No it says what what is the kind of interface , marketing: Well it doesn't , but it uh {disfmarker} project manager: No . industrial designer: if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel {disfmarker} so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , project manager: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: And L_C_ display . industrial designer: so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Wh wh what's our criteria ? marketing: This sample sensor {gap} . project manager: Our budget's twelve point five . industrial designer: Uh okay . marketing: Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there . project manager: Yeah , so that has implications though for the {gap} . industrial designer: Uh it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker . {gap} when you say {disfmarker} when you press one it says one or it says hello . marketing: Yeah . project manager: For the locator . marketing: But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ? industrial designer: Mm {vocalsound} and the locator also goes away . project manager: Yeah . marketing: We can afford to get rid of it . user interface: But it was very no innovative project manager: Yeah . marketing: So that means no locator , does it ? user interface: {gap} innovativeness {gap} . Well um {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: I mean does {disfmarker} project manager: What else does it need ? user interface: Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . project manager: Yeah , 'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing . user interface: This would be {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah yeah {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . user interface: there you record your samples your speech samples and {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , okay , so we {disfmarker} industrial designer: A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . Uh I mean uh um {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: Uh-huh . marketing: Okay , yeah . industrial designer: Um {disfmarker} project manager: Right , so we need one fifty off . marketing: See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause {disfmarker} project manager: Take it down to just a scroll wheel . {vocalsound} We could do {disfmarker} industrial designer: So tha that {vocalsound} mean that we cannot press {disfmarker} how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ? user interface: Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget . industrial designer: If {vocalsound} in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button . user interface: Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . marketing: But that's {disfmarker} well you would just have to to spin it down {gap} . project manager: Yeah . You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: No w w w but ha marketing: So that's point three . industrial designer: it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing . user interface: But I mean {vocalsound} we can put an additional mute button on the top as well . marketing: Yeah , user interface: If you {disfmarker} marketing: I mean that wouldn't actually cost any more . That's the spin wheel though , isn't it ? Didn't that come with the L_C_ {disfmarker} project manager: That's with the L_C_ industrial designer: That comes with the L_C_D_ ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: We decided , 'cause it's not on our list . industrial designer: Oh so so the the this is {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: Mm . project manager: The scroll wheel is on the side . industrial designer: {gap} . So {vocalsound} we're adding costs for {gap} right , okay uh I mean I think this is good . marketing: S so we're point three over . user interface: So {disfmarker} project manager: We're point three over at the moment . marketing: Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether project manager: It's nothing n marketing: and just have pushbuttons for the volume . Could b still put them on the side . But yeah . project manager: Yeah , marketing: I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but {disfmarker} project manager: I have {disfmarker} industrial designer: Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up {disfmarker} for up and down . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: On the side . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Mm uh it sounds good actually , yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Okay , yeah . project manager: Rather than having three different things that people have to do . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} . user interface: Okay . project manager: There we go . Oh look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses . marketing: Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve {gap} , couldn't we ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour . marketing: Yeah , but {gap} {disfmarker} project manager: So that's alright . We we'll leave it at that {gap} marketing: Yeah . project manager: and then I'll take {disfmarker} I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it , industrial designer: {vocalsound} We have , yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Excellent . Alright . So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ? marketing: No . industrial designer: Not really , no . marketing: No , I don't think so . industrial designer: Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: We {disfmarker} instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: We just got rid of a gimmick that was never {gap} anyway , industrial designer: Um yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was {disfmarker} it's not a great difference I don't think . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} But we lose the locator . project manager: Alright then . marketing: Really ? project manager: We're gonna have a beep . user interface: {vocalsound} Well {gap} we're going to have a beeping thing . industrial designer: So instead of speaker , {gap} . project manager: Yeah . user interface: But yeah , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: 'Kay . {vocalsound} marketing: Cool . That's not a very exciting colour . I think you should make it more vegetable-like . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Tha user interface: Which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Oh the the beeper thing . project manager: {gap} . marketing: It {disfmarker} user interface: But it can be yellow as well . It can come in the same colour as the the case . project manager: 'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh {gap} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , I think Jen wants it to vibrate . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , I know I know , my pen vibrates . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: You know , your pen vibrates ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: But only for a very short time . Um okay . So looks like we've designed a banana . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Well done , team . {vocalsound} Um we need {disfmarker} we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product . industrial designer: {vocalsound} I think it mm {disfmarker} marketing: Cool . project manager: Feedback ? Ideas ? user interface: Yeah mm , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Um we kap kept a adding things randomly . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: So , had we known {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . marketing: If we'd had that sheet at the beginning {gap} should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , that or not , yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . So {vocalsound} d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Mm . {vocalsound} project manager: But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of . industrial designer: Yeah , mm . marketing: I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know . It wasn't like we were alone for very long , project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: so you didn't {vocalsound} st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating {vocalsound} remote control {vocalsound} shaped like a banana , project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Banana . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Um yeah , so yeah . user interface: Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used . project manager: Mm-hmm , the whiteboard digital pens . user interface: And the pens . {vocalsound} marketing: Uh I like the pens . project manager: {vocalsound} We like the pens . {vocalsound} marketing: I want one . That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s project manager: Yeah , you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down industrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah , project manager: and have it printed out when you got back to the office . user interface: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: that's it's it's {disfmarker} project manager: They great ? industrial designer: I wonder what one of these costs . {vocalsound} project manager: Do you think they'd notice if one went ? marketing: {vocalsound} I don't think you should say that was the recording . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Oh okay . marketing: Okay , cover up the microphone . Alright , let's take it . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Yep . Shh . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Yep . marketing: Okay . project manager: But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 'cause the {disfmarker} I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there , marketing: It is a bit limiting , isn't it ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: yep . user interface: Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . The thing flew in , project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there wasn't time for that , so yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . That's alright , that always irritates me anyway , yeah . marketing: Not that you can do that on the board , either . We could make some little {disfmarker} user interface: But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah . marketing: Yeah , totally , I mean that was fairly tight anyway , I mean especially with that last-minute alteration . project manager: Mm . Yeah . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} back it , {vocalsound} this is {disfmarker} just had to be changed user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: . And {disfmarker} yeah , so {disfmarker} cool . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: And presumably you don't {disfmarker} you can say nasty things as well . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . project manager: I have no stake in it . user interface: I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah . marketing: Yeah , definitely . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: You weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good . project manager: You have to say that , 'cause I'm taking the notes . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: I'll leave the room and you can have another go . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: I know you've got the pen , you might attack me with it . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Better than that than the banana . user interface: And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah . project manager: I think it worked quite well . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ? user interface: To express them mm mm industrial designer: Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group , user interface: no . industrial designer: so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: {gap} . New ideas found . Not quite sure what about . user interface: Well it's it's it's pretty new , industrial designer: Mm . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it . user interface: Yeah , neither neither do I , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so . industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Yeah . I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay . project manager: Yeah , that's right . {vocalsound} marketing: That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a {gap} remote control . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one . marketing: Yeah , yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Patent patent patent . Mm . marketing: I think we'd like to think the ideas were new , project manager: Banana remote . marketing: but we've got no way of finding out . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: That vibrates {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Flip . Vibrate user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it . project manager: . And uh {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} Nothing that you really want . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: True . Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . So , costs are within budget , marketing: Yes . user interface: Yes . {vocalsound} project manager: well within budget , including a little {disfmarker} what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . Um we've evaluated the project . user interface: Yes . marketing: And it's fabulous . project manager: You've got the scores . Can you put that in the project documents file ? marketing: It's in the project documents {gap} . project manager: It's in there already . And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . Were there any {disfmarker} was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ? user interface: And my main difficulty was the the time pressure . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Otherwise it's it's all fine . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: Yeah , yeah , sometimes it's like a little bit rushed . industrial designer: {vocalsound} I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah . industrial designer: Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: Okay then . Um I think we're still well within our time . marketing: Yeah , we've got like five minutes left . project manager: We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . We're just too too efficient user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} We certainly are , project manager: and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: mm . Yeah . user interface: Yes . project manager: So I would say that's the end of that meeting . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: 'Kay . project manager: Thank you , team . user interface: Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , same here . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: It was very productive day and {disfmarker} marketing: We could draw animals on the board again . project manager: {vocalsound} Mm uh no . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm uh no . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I don't think so . {vocalsound} user interface: You can make some animals . marketing: I don't like Play-Doh , no . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Oh , you don't like anim marketing: It's just minging . It smells so bad . user interface: {vocalsound} It doesn't ? marketing: It does . user interface: Smells quite nice . Smells very sweet . marketing: Mm . project manager: Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . industrial designer: Was there a questionnaire already sent ? project manager: I don't know if it's already sent or not . marketing: No , it hasn't been . project manager: Um presumably I have to {disfmarker} marketing: Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ? project manager: I don't see why you can't stay here , really . marketing: Okay , so the other way . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Did I save this one ? Production costs . user interface: {vocalsound} I made your animal for you . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} It was supposed to be pink . {vocalsound} But it was blue on the board . user interface: Yeah , that's the one {disfmarker}
