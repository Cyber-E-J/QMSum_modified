This thing uh that looks like a pie , marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: are actually all microphones . marketing: Yeah . Okay . project manager: So you must be careful with uh with uh all this . And uh as I can see you uh you have placed your laptops uh exactly on the place where it must be . And that has to do with the camera settings , so we don't have our uh laptops in front of the cameras . marketing: Of our faces . project manager: And {disfmarker} Indeed . So they can see our faces . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Welcome at the kick-off meeting . My name is uh Danny Wolfs . {vocalsound} Uh this is the agenda for today . Uh first a little opening . Uh I will introduce myself , uh and uh I think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself . Uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance , acquaintance to uh to to ourselves . So uh we get to know each other . Uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards . Then the project plan . What we're going to do , and how we're going to do it . Uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end . {vocalsound} Okay uh , my name is uh Danny Wolfs . I'm the Project Manager . What's your name ? user interface: I'm Juergen Toffs . I'm the User Interface Designer . project manager: User interface , okay . industrial designer: Hi , my name's uh {gap} . I'm the Industrial Designer . project manager: Industrial , yes . marketing: I'm uh Tim {gap} . Um my function is the Marketing Expert . project manager: Okay , thank you . First a little about the project aim . Uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control . Uh maybe you have read uh read the website . It's a very uh , yeah , very uh ambitious uh company . They uh they wanna do something else . I w Uh there must be a new remote control . Uh first of all uh it must be original , uh and trendy . That's two things really uh close to each other . But at the same time uh user-friendly . And they have uh {disfmarker} Yeah , that's uh very important uh for them . Uh there are three stages . There is a functional design . So uh what are we going uh to uh to do ? What are we going to uh uh make f uh kind of functions in the remote ? And why are we going to do it ? Then the conceptual design . How are going to do it ? {vocalsound} And that's uh really global . Uh because at the detailed design , how , part two , uh we go uh to dig in uh really about how the the te the technical of {disfmarker} If it's uh it's possible technical-wise . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh each stage is uh {vocalsound} uh is broken up in two uh two stages , individual work and a meeting . So it's uh it's very straightforward . {vocalsound} Okay , the tool training . We have two smart boards . {vocalsound} This one is for the presentations , the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you uh you had . Uh and this is uh only for uh drawing . So uh we uh must let it uh stand on this uh this programme . {vocalsound} This is called a smart board marketing: {vocalsound} Speaks for itself . project manager: thing uh {disfmarker} Yeah , it speaks for itself . Um and as you uh may have heard , the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen . Not in y the the My Documents . So if you wanna show something , put it in the shared folder . {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} This uh is {gap} very straightforward , with the save , the print , the undo , the blank , the select , the pen . Well , I don't uh gonna explain it all , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: because I think you know uh how it works . Um we must not forget uh everything we draw on here , uh all must be saved . We we may not delete anything . So uh if you have uh drawn something , save it . Never delete it . That's a very important uh thing . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . Uh little uh little {vocalsound} kinda exercise to uh know each other . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} At uh the white board on the left . Every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} and uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal . Uh important is that we use different colours , {vocalsound} and uh different pen widths . Widths . Widths . marketing: I have a question . project manager: Yes ? marketing: Um this exercise , um did the company board tell you to do it , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: or uh did you just make it up yourself ? project manager: No no no . It's uh it's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I I I must do it . marketing: It's part of the introduction , project manager: Yeah , yeah , yeah . 'Cause we uh really don't know each other , marketing: okay . project manager: and uh it's kinda new . So getting used to each other , we can uh have a little fun then , before we uh dig in really to the hard stuff . marketing: Okay . {vocalsound} project manager: That kind of thing . Would you start with drawing your uh favourite animal ? marketing: Um , yeah . I don't know really how it works . But maybe you can show us first ? project manager: {vocalsound} Okay , okay . Yeah , okay . Drawing goes with uh this thing . Do not touch your hand on uh this little uh thingy here . That's uh important . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: So hold it uh like this . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: You g you get electrocuted or {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , kinda . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: So , {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} You must p p uh push a little uh {disfmarker} Good .

After a cat , a turtle and a dog . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: I think he's gonna draw an elephant . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I figure I should do something like that , project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: but I'm gonna do something much more difficult . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh-oh . user interface: Uh-oh . Oh , he is the artistic {gap} design . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: I'm gonna design a remote uh {vocalsound} remote control animal . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Remote control animal . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Exactly . Uh {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Sorry . user interface: Well with the interface , it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there uh . marketing: Yeah . project manager: {gap} marketing: That that might be easier . But at the other hand , uh a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand , and {disfmarker} project manager: No . marketing: I think it's easier to draw . project manager: Better to draw with a with {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . With a pen than with a mouse mouse . user interface: Than on the , with {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , I m I mean like uh like on here , drawing drawing uh . And then displaying on screen , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Mouth . Oh , okay . Yeah . W with this paper it's too mu too expensive . {vocalsound} project manager: But what is he uh ? user interface: Too expensive , yeah . project manager: Is it a rabbit ? industrial designer: Yes . {vocalsound} project manager: Do you have a rabbit at home ? marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: No . marketing: It's a rabbit with uh broken legs ? {vocalsound} user interface: A green rabbit . industrial designer: {vocalsound} No . {vocalsound} project manager: Is it a white rabbit f It's the white rabbit from The Matrix . industrial designer: Yeah , exactly . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , then yeah . user interface: There , the g white green rabbit . industrial designer: So . user interface: {vocalsound} He's a little bit stoned there . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh I figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit . marketing: Yeah . It will do . industrial designer: Uh uh {disfmarker} Uh well . project manager: Okay . Finishing touch and then we're going further . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Project Manager ? Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah ? industrial designer: Where does the pen go ? Just uh {disfmarker} marketing: Have you been uh counting the time ? project manager: Yeah , a little . {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . Let's go on then . project manager: Well , I think the dog is the the most uh artistic . industrial designer: Uh I figured the rabbit was actually the most uh impressive . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Don't choose for youself . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Oh , sorry . {vocalsound} project manager: That's selfish . Okay , now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff . marketing: It's pretty abstract . project manager: {vocalsound} Uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five Euro , and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half Euro . So uh from my point of view , I don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech , high definition , uh ultra modern uh kinda remote , for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half Euro . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million Euro . So that's a lot . We have to sell uh a lot of uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , how much is it ? marketing: Like how much ? user interface: Hundred million uh remotes or something ? project manager: Uh I think uh w when the selling price is twenty five , uh uh you got two million , two million remotes . user interface: Oh yeah . industrial designer: Twenty million . Two million , oh yeah , two million . Yeah . project manager: But our marketing range is uh , market range is international . So we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh we can sell our r remotes to . At least that uh countries which have uh a television . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Um {disfmarker} So now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things . You can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself , at home . What you think might be uh a useful uh new feature . What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . Um so uh let's uh let's uh discuss a little . I'm gonna join you at the table . {vocalsound} Well what what's the most uh important thing at a remote control ? user interface: Um well I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible . Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . So not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio and {disfmarker} Or just only {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . I think so . Uh but I have some points . Can I show them on the on the big screen ? Maybe ? project manager: If you have them on uh {disfmarker} I can uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . Yeah , I can find {disfmarker} Uh . project manager: Okay . Oh , in case you want it {disfmarker} This is a dead kind of fly . Between the the the , yeah , the the uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Screen ? project manager: Yeah , be The screens . marketing: Okay . user interface: Is it possible to open pen drawings in this uh on this screen ? project manager: {vocalsound} No no no . Only {disfmarker} All the drawings go there , at the left uh {disfmarker} {gap} user interface: Uh but um which {disfmarker} The ones we made on the {disfmarker} project manager: Oh , that pen drawings . Uh no , I think uh when it is uh in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder , you can show it there . user interface: Oh , only in Word , project manager: Yeah . user interface: okay . marketing: Okay , I have some uh points from marketing point of view . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Um just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive , uh small , fairly cheap . Uh it's pretty cheap , twenty five Euros . Uh brand independent . Um I think , it doesn't have to matter uh which brand your T_V_ or other thing is . Um {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . Okay . Five minutes . marketing: Five minutes ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: Okay , I'll wrap it up quickly . Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose . project manager: Yeah . marketing: And uh by making it multi-purpose , it uh has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from uh from current products . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Um maybe some other technology than infrared . Uh I rather find it very annoying um , like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it . Um {vocalsound} think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth . project manager: Okay . Okay . marketing: That might be a little bit uh expensive . Um {disfmarker} And something like an L_C_D_ screen . user interface: For what purpose ? marketing: Um uh like I said here um {disfmarker} Maybe it's easy . It's nice as an added feature feature , that um , {vocalsound} when you're on a certain channel , you can see on the L_C_D_ screen uh what programmes are coming up or {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . So it be uh a multi-purpose uh very technically uh high uh marketing: From my point of view , yeah . project manager: remote ? Yeah , it must be really uh innovative , technical-wise ? marketing: Yeah , it has to be uh {disfmarker} Yeah , our company is very uh good in making new innovative uh things . project manager: Yeah . So yeah , I I agree with you . user interface: {vocalsound} We {disfmarker} marketing: So i i i i project manager: So we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to {disfmarker} marketing: To the current market . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Look , {vocalsound} you got some cheap uh remote controls there . They just uh {disfmarker} Yeah , you got a dozen of 'em . project manager: No . marketing: But when you enter a new market with a remote control and project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: uh wanna gain market share project manager: Yeah . marketing: you have to do something special , I think . project manager: Yeah . But we have to keep an eye that it's {disfmarker} Uh at the beginning of such a project , it's it's it's very uh cool to talk about , well , this would be cool , that would be cool . marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , of course . user interface: And and the price . {gap} marketing: But it's {disfmarker} But but this is just from marketing uh aspect . project manager: Yeah okay . Yeah . Okay . marketing: I don't know anything about user interface or {vocalsound} design . user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: {gap} And that's because we have him . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} And and him . {vocalsound} user interface: And him . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes . So uh you uh will have uh individual actions where I presume uh will be some feedback , uh via the m the mail . Um {vocalsound} the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design . {vocalsound} Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions . So that's the thing we uh discussed . user interface: Yeah . Um one thing uh , project manager: Yeah ? user interface: we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make . Do we {disfmarker} Are we going to use um it it for multiple systems ? Or uh {disfmarker} We should have some agreement on that before we {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . Um wha marketing: {vocalsound} Mm uh I I don't think we have to be , we have to agree on that . Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually . marketing: I think th that's a pha Yeah . user interface: Okay . marketing: That's a phase further . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Ju just uh make some mock-ups , some some general ideas . user interface: Ah okay . marketing: And and then we can plan {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: We can plan further , I think . project manager: Yeah . But maybe , because uh you are working on the user requirements , you are working on the technical functions , we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh {disfmarker} How do you call it ? Uh {disfmarker} user interface: Consensus on the , what we're gonna do . project manager: Uh a little plan on on what we're going to do . So you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all . Some basic things we co we want to going to do . Uh I think that's well uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Will come in handy . marketing: Mm yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: I don't know . You decide . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . marketing: You're the Project Manager . project manager: W {vocalsound} He says {disfmarker} user interface: if the technical functions have to be designed , I I've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Or do we use it a text screen ? Or uh will it be with uh with bluetooth or {disfmarker} project manager: Well , th that's that's really a step further . But if you say uh {vocalsound} is it uh uh one way or multi-purpose , that's a {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . Mm-hmm . marketing: Uh tha that's a same step further . project manager: Why ? industrial designer: Yeah , actually it is . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Why ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Then looking at individual components , marketing: Uh . industrial designer: so that's actually a f step further . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Like we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it , or how it has to be like . And then in the next meeting we decide project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , we can take it from there . marketing: w what it's gonna be . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah , I agree uh , we can take it from there . marketing: A And then you s then you can delete uh industrial designer: Or edit . marketing: the o the obsolete uh details . project manager: Okay . So uh marketing: I think . project manager: each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important . And uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting . marketing: Yeah . project manager: I must finish off now , marketing: Yeah . project manager: so it's over . You uh will receive specific specific instructions uh by your personal coach . And I see you in uh thirty minutes . Thank you . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Okay , cheers . user interface: Sorry . project manager: {vocalsound} Be careful . marketing: Damn . user interface: Yes . marketing: Success ? {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . No . Come up .
