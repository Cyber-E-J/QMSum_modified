project manager: So , I will open our functional design meeting . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: So , I will play role of the secretary . As also Program Ma Manager . So , we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and um industrial designer: Industrial Design . marketing: Marketing Expert . project manager: What's your talk ? user interface: Okay . project manager: Marketing Experts . {vocalsound} marketing: Mm . project manager: And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . Mm so um I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer . user interface: Okay . project manager: Um , so you're participant two ? industrial designer: One one . user interface: No no no . project manager: No you're {disfmarker} user interface: One . project manager: No , industrial designer: Three three , it's three project manager: I'm participant one . {vocalsound} industrial designer: sorry {vocalsound} . user interface: I I think I'm a {gap} . project manager: Okay , never mind . marketing: Okay . project manager: 'Kay , did you save your presentation ? {vocalsound} user interface: In one . industrial designer: In one , sorry {vocalsound} . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Isn't that technical functions ? marketing: No sure . industrial designer: So you didn't save it maybe . marketing: Uh user interface: It's mine . marketing: it's David Jordan . Course . industrial designer: Alright , so {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Name's Jordan . So industrial designer: David Jordan ? {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . user interface: Mm yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: so I'll {disfmarker} I let David Jordan do his presentation . user interface: Okay . marketing: No , no . Uh this one doesn't want to be moved , I think . project manager: Uh . industrial designer: Too great for email then . user interface: Okay , so . The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Uh I I will focus on user interface design . project manager: Mm . user interface: Um so move to the next slide . As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very {disfmarker} has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture . There's a lot of functions . Over , I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control . So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ? Um , let's move to next slide . Um . Yeah . So I {disfmarker} so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface . A very good example is Google . As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface . Um so move to next s slide . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller {vocalsound} which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: That's the end of the talk {vocalsound} the end of the presentation . project manager: So you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful . user interface: Uh {disfmarker} With sophisticated functions , project manager: So powerful , user interface: but with very {disfmarker} yeah powerful . project manager: many functions and very easy to use . user interface: Yes . Yep . marketing: So , I dunno , it's maybe difficult to have both , industrial designer: To merge the two system huh . marketing: I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: You mean this one ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , I suppose . industrial designer: Mm yep . marketing: {gap} industrial designer: But But this is {disfmarker} user interface: But if we have very very good user interface marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and then {disfmarker} user interface: it take less time for user to learn how to use it . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah you {disfmarker} maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are {disfmarker} or almost the same , so the sign . project manager: Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ? industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same . marketing: Oh it should {disfmarker} okay , yeah . The user should know . industrial designer: So you have to {disfmarker} The sh the user there {disfmarker} for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that {disfmarker} So . project manager: Yeah um such as maybe the {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . So . project manager: Go on , go back and {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright . marketing: Yeah , that's gonna be the trick . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , that's my job . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} That's your job {vocalsound} user interface: That's my job . It's not the easiest I've got to . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: It you {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: So , you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use . user interface: Yep . marketing: Okay . project manager: Okay . user interface: Powerful and easy to use . marketing: So that's the point . user interface: Yeah , that's the point . project manager: So , next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things . industrial designer: Okay , okay . project manager: So you you're {disfmarker} industrial designer: Participant two . Yeah . project manager: Um . Okay . marketing: {gap} industrial designer: {vocalsound} The rationale must be {vocalsound} design , or {disfmarker} project manager: So , Baba is the uh the Industrial Designer . Okay . industrial designer: So we can move to the next slide . As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control . So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ . So , this one is leather bu based marketing: Mm . industrial designer: but {disfmarker} I propose a nifra infrared base {vocalsound} you know , so so for me I think that it is better {vocalsound} it's bet it's better to control T_V_ project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: so you know , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know {disfmarker} For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to {disfmarker} marketing: True . project manager: So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ? industrial designer: I think it's cheaper than laser , so {vocalsound} . marketing: Okay . project manager: Yeah . Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ? Twelve , nearly thirteen , marketing: What the cost is ? project manager: yeah . The cost {disfmarker} marketing: Twelve , twelve a half . industrial designer: Yeah , I think for the cost we want {disfmarker} for the cost we want {vocalsound} {disfmarker} it's better to have uh uh Let's see . Yeah . You can move to the next slide , so . So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: and the bulb it will be somewhere inside . marketing: That might just {disfmarker} So . industrial designer: You can go to the next slide . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: I have some kind of pictures you know , here . You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so . project manager: What is this ? industrial designer: This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Look . But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and {gap} . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: So and the next slide , it is the last one it's {disfmarker} So it's {disfmarker} I think it should be wire {vocalsound} wireless re remote con {vocalsound} Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless . project manager: Okay . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: Okay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ? marketing: What's the average price of this technology then ? industrial designer: Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . Or at least you know , the user interface: So what , the wireless remote control ? There's a wire {vocalsound} with remote control ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} You'd {disfmarker} yes , you can . It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so . We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . We can have both also . user interface: Okay . project manager: So you think that uh {vocalsound} a cable between the remote control {vocalsound} and the T_V_ {vocalsound} {disfmarker} won't be a good idea . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} No it wou maybe it will be cheaper {vocalsound} I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu marketing: But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , user interface: {vocalsound} Wireless remote control {vocalsound} . project manager: but {disfmarker} marketing: I don't think {disfmarker} well , yeah , I don't think he would , industrial designer: Yeah , but some pa I always want to have you know , project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: but in a sense {disfmarker} industrial designer: sometime I want to have wire because you know . project manager: Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? industrial designer: {gap} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} I'm just asking you . Do you think it will be cheaper ? industrial designer: Uh , {vocalsound} I don't {vocalsound} think it will be too much . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Could you answer please ? {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's {disfmarker} I think that you know you can always you know {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so . project manager: Yeah , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: The wire ? project manager: As it's {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: Yeah . True . industrial designer: Okay , yeah . project manager: I think it's more your problem . Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Uh that's my job . That's the {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Okay , {gap} I'm sorry . marketing: Now the {disfmarker} project manager: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because {disfmarker} even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the {vocalsound} the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know . If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , {vocalsound} so {vocalsound} it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question . project manager: {vocalsound} So user interface: Okay . project manager: just think of um the usability . user interface: Design a wireless remote control . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . Just think of the problem . If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: I think it's would be easier to have {vocalsound} a link between the remote control and the television , marketing: Well that's actually one of the point , yeah ? True . project manager: yeah . marketing: This you will see in my presentation then . project manager: {vocalsound} So I will let you to do your presentation , so . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay {vocalsound} . marketing: Which is participant four . So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh . We've made a study , so could you go to next slide . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Sorry for the functional recurrence . So that's the standard method for marketing , okay . We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , and see what was okay or not for them . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: Okay . So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , so that's {disfmarker} project manager: You mean the loo the look , the outside ? industrial designer: The look , how it look like . marketing: Yeah , the the look is is bad for them project manager: Okay . marketing: so uh it's your job , David , maybe . Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly . So this is where we could have uh yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So it's it's interesting information , I think . And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so {disfmarker} doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . So we should change this as well . And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . And uh this is one of the main point for me . But I'll come back to it later . 'Kay . Could you go next slide ? Uh , so as you said uh , project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: So this is from the experiments we've done , project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think . Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users . project manager: {vocalsound} What is R_S_I_ ? marketing: R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um {disfmarker} doing the same movement several times , then you get injured . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Ah um okay . {vocalsound} marketing: Okay ? So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . So last slide . Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons , user interface: Functions . marketing: this would definitely be a good way of selling more . Okay . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: So {disfmarker} project manager: Mm okay . And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: Sure ? Yeah ? user interface: Yeah , I think possible . Because we can {disfmarker} We can uh mix uh several function in one button . project manager: Yeah . user interface: So lets you {disfmarker} then you have less buttons . project manager: Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ? user interface: But I'm not sure {disfmarker} project manager: Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know . marketing: Yeah , remember the user is not happy to read the industrial designer: The manuals . project manager: Yeah , marketing: manual . project manager: I think the {disfmarker} marketing: It's {disfmarker} user interface: No you you can have a switch menu , so you can project manager: Yeah , but it has to be intuitive . user interface: well for example {disfmarker} Yeah , I think so . Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes . Then for um you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions . project manager: Yeah , okay . Okay , user interface: Then you you put the switch button , project manager: but {disfmarker} user interface: then it switch to another category of functions . Yeah . For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder . industrial designer: With a {disfmarker} user interface: So there's a different functions , but i if you you {disfmarker} there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder . So we can has less buttons . project manager: Yeah , but {disfmarker} user interface: But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny {disfmarker} look fancy , not funny . industrial designer: Look fancy . marketing: {gap} industrial designer: This is a question that should be asked to the {disfmarker} If you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people {gap} . user interface: Because different people have a different opinion about fancy . You know . marketing: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , this is something we sh user interface: Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people , but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some {disfmarker} for other peoples , so . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: But this was first step and {disfmarker} This was the first step , yeah . industrial designer: I think the solution is to have many colours of {disfmarker} you know instead of having one grey standard {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control . marketing: Specially distribution , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah , maybe . Yeah , maybe . project manager: If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more . marketing: Uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , personalised colour . Because you know {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , it will cost little bit more . user interface: Yeah , because maybe some people prefer a red remote control , industrial designer: Yeah , yeah , yeah . user interface: some people prefer black remote control . marketing: Yeah , but this is what we would ask to the users , so . project manager: And also f user interface: Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options , marketing: Yeah . user interface: so user can select which colour they prefer , so . project manager: Yeah , but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases , marketing: Yeah , user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: remember it's twelve Euros . project manager: and we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it . So , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Hmm . project manager: And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on T_V_ . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: So {disfmarker} I think you have quite lot of points to to think about industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and to discuss it with uh the other members . industrial designer: Yeah , hmm . user interface: Yeah . project manager: So , is it okay for your presentation ? Nothing else to to add ? marketing: Yeah , it's done , just {disfmarker} yeah . If we would {disfmarker} if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it . project manager: Mm-hmm . Okay . Mm so {disfmarker} marketing: So . project manager: So , I had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's {disfmarker} user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: It's is uh {disfmarker} marketing: Lame , or {disfmarker} project manager: No yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext . user interface: Mm-hmm . Yeah . project manager: So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control , industrial designer: Yep . project manager: and also the remote control will only be used for television , so for y for you your designing , you're not {disfmarker} you won't be uh {disfmarker} you won't had {vocalsound} um buttons to just to manipulate {disfmarker} yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that . user interface: Control . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} project manager: It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Mm-hmm project manager: because if we want to to do remote control user interface: Mm . project manager: which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that . We really want to focus on the remote control for the television . Is it okay ? user interface: Okay . But there's balance between function and the cost . project manager: So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy . user interface: Yeah . Okay . project manager: And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Yeah . project manager: I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product . user interface: Mm-hm . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um user interface: Okay . project manager: of the uh of real reaction user interface: Okay . industrial designer: So . project manager: and uh also {disfmarker} marketing: So has to be yellow . industrial designer: Yellow . project manager: Yeah . As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use . user interface: Okay . Mm-hmm . project manager: Require lot of requirements , industrial designer: {vocalsound} For cheap {vocalsound} remote control , yeah . project manager: but {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . And cheap . project manager: Yeah . user interface: A low cost . project manager: Yeah . But uh that's your your job to find something mm matches . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} . Yeah , 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet , so . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: This is {disfmarker} marketing: I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway . project manager: Maybe not , marketing: It's maybe more in browsing . project manager: but mayb industrial designer: Yeah , but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web . user interface: Yeah , there's that box in uh o of it . marketing: Yeah . user interface: A pi There's that box in the T_V_ , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Ok marketing: Hm-mm . user interface: It's It's not so uh popular now . {vocalsound} industrial designer: It's pop I don't think it's popular , so that's the problem so . You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know user interface: Mm . industrial designer: the global usage , user interface: Global , industrial designer: so if people don't have the technology . user interface: okay . project manager: So . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: So everybody is okay with the new requirements ? user interface: So I I so {disfmarker} As as for the colour , what what do you think ? project manager: I think it has to be yellow . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yellow ? Do you think that people like the colour yellow ? {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yellow ? {gap} T_V_ remote control ? {vocalsound} marketing: Min project manager: Maybe you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised . user interface: Okay . Okay . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ . Or should be . project manager: Why you go {disfmarker} It has to be fashion . industrial designer: Yeah , so . Doesn't need to be completely yellow , project manager: So you have to {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . industrial designer: but just mm . project manager: Yeah . It has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society . Just when you enter you say oh , oh , it's real reaction . Think it's a re reaction remote control , so . user interface: Okay , okay . Okay . project manager: And also it has to be attractive , of course , user interface: Mm . project manager: because if you want to sale {disfmarker} to sell the remote control . It's okay ? marketing: Regarding the first line , what {disfmarker} So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext . project manager: Yeah . marketing: And that's it . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: But {disfmarker} I dunno , but why , nobody's a threat to me . marketing: It's already changed for {disfmarker} project manager: I think it would be simpler . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Okay . So {disfmarker} I will close the meeting , um just after that we'll have lunch break . And you will have in thirty minutes individual work . Uh {disfmarker} Y you {disfmarker} You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um {disfmarker} pon marketing: Industrial Designer . industrial designer: Industrial Designer , yeah . Component component , yeah . project manager: yeah , and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept . user interface: Okay . project manager: And Florent to work my subject . marketing: Yep . project manager: And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . marketing: Okay . project manager: It's okay ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: I think the um session is closed . industrial designer: Good . project manager: And by the way , Mister David Jordan , please record your presentations in your own folder . {vocalsound} Not in mine . industrial designer: Okay {vocalsound} Okay , that's clear . user interface: Okay {vocalsound} . Okay . {vocalsound} project manager: Should be better . {vocalsound}
