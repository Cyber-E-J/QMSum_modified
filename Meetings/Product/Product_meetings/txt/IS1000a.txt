user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Or you get it . Okay . user interface: No I don't think so it has to be like that yeah and you have to adjust the length . Okay , and then . project manager: {vocalsound} So we uh {disfmarker} we will wait for Anna , a few minutes . user interface: Yeah , s yeah , um . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Mm {vocalsound} . Yours is well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: I think you can put anywhere you want , actually . I thin industrial designer: Yeah but the the mic should not {disfmarker} user interface: It's not a directional mic , anyway . project manager: I think it should work like this . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Uh . project manager: So I will try to get my presentation running . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: Mm .

Um after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: See what our roles are in this project . So , um {disfmarker} We have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh {disfmarker} to communicate and to well , learn from each other's plans uh as I can say um so w we will also try to uh to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me I don't know whether you worked with them before . Um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan . You all know I hope {vocalsound} how it's about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Total . project manager: Uh then we will uh discuss uh , well , how it should be and uh {disfmarker} wh what uh what our new product should look lite {disfmarker} like . And uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes I hope uh we can end this meeting . So . Um basically this is about a uh a new c remote control . Um {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} When you design a new product you of {disfmarker} uh you of course want it to be original . Be uh {disfmarker} we want to be distinguished , mm ? People uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think , well that's the product I I need . So it needs to be trendy . I mean trendy is what people want , so then I w they will buy our product . But then , uh , it also should work uh user friendly and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: So , the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase . Um {disfmarker} You all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase and uh then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design . And the same holds for the uh ph two phases uh after this , the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape . Alright , but first we will do some uh tool training . In all in front of you uh you see uh the uh notebooks and w uh n note blocks and we have here a a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a white-board . user interface: Whitebo marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: And um well it should work uh {disfmarker} I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar . I didn't find out yet how it work , but maybe one of you did , so {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Under documents in the shared folder . Okay . project manager: Yes . Do {disfmarker} Do we have to say something about that ? I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh . industrial designer: Yeah , I guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share . And uh , yeah . project manager: Yes well we will then find out ho how it works . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Um . Well , this seems to me , yes , some computer program but I didn't find it yet . So , we'll come to that later . So , uh now we will try out the white-board we have here . So , I would suggest uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Each of us is going . project manager: Well , yes , um we uh we should try to t to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way . I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm not really sure how this works , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay , shall I start ? marketing: Mm . Yeah . project manager: Yes , user interface: Yeah , project manager: a good idea Mael . user interface: you can start it you know . marketing: I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard , but they'll be recording what we write down . industrial designer: So , i user interface: No they will record through that . There's a sensor over there marketing: Mm . Mm . user interface: which is going to record the strokes that you make . marketing: But for us it's just like a normal whiteboard . project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah . project manager: 'Kay . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: But it's {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Actually , I think I cannot go with uh {disfmarker} project manager: You {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} D doesn't it work ? Maybe someo Maybe {disfmarker} maybe Anna , maybe you can start . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Then he can maybe find out to get his cord right . marketing: I have to draw . project manager: So um {disfmarker} L Why don't you draw uh {vocalsound} your favourite animal on on th on the white-board . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: M my {disfmarker} my favourite animal . {vocalsound} Sorry this is all tangled up here . project manager: Oh , I see uh {disfmarker} marketing: That's better . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . Yes . Mm . So draw it . We will try to guess what it is . {vocalsound} marketing: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} I'm a very bad drawer . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Weird . Um . You're not gonna be able to guess from my drawing . I'm a bad drawer . Okay . project manager: Mm . marketing: They're ears , by the way . user interface: 's a cat . marketing: No . Um close though . Okay so {disfmarker} like a pet animal . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} Like a cat . user interface: Yeah . project manager: It's like a cat , so I guess it's a cat . {vocalsound} marketing: No , not a cat though . project manager: What is this now ? user interface: Ah you forget about it . industrial designer: You're on the knife . user interface: Yeah , uh I think it's fine . I just don't want to carry it off . Man , this wires , eh ? We need a wireless microphone . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: You know ? Pro specially we should next project we should take l like that . marketing: Okay . So . project manager: So , marketing: It's not a cat , project manager: that's the cat . marketing: it's a dog . project manager: Oh . user interface: So . industrial designer: Mael . project manager: It's a dog . marketing: Yes . project manager: So but that's also kind of cat , user interface: Oh project manager: isn't it ? user interface: the dog doesn't have a tail ? marketing: {vocalsound} It's got a tail then . project manager: B bo both predators . user interface: Yeah , sure , yeah . marketing: Yeah yeah . user interface: I thought so .

Uh d did you uh work out cord ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: And you guessed cats without a tail . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , I think I will go without {disfmarker} without it , marketing: Okay . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: right ? user interface: It'll still not extend , right ? It's not up to that . marketing: Okay , there you go . So what favourite characteristics . Uh . Dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun . A horse ? user interface: It's a horse . marketing: {vocalsound} This is why you're the designer . And I'm marketing . {vocalsound} project manager: Yes . Yes , yes this is {disfmarker} Yes definitely a horse . Yes . Oh very good . So {disfmarker} marketing: Ah {vocalsound} project manager: I suppose it {disfmarker} user interface: Ah I think you can put that . marketing: Mm-hmm . That's it . {vocalsound} A blue and black zebra {vocalsound} . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yes . Can {disfmarker} you can meet them in Africa , I think . Yes . Very good . So {disfmarker} marketing: The very rare blue zebras .

A mouse ? project manager: This looks likes a cat who has been driven over . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: And we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics , right ? marketing: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} project manager: Yes , the moustache . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} project manager: That's {disfmarker} that's definitely a cat . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Uh yeah . And i Th They like to sleep , that's why you said you they are like this . project manager: {vocalsound} It's quite , you know {disfmarker} relaxed situation . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Yes . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: {vocalsound} Yes , okay . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} She has the small legs . project manager: Th thank you , Matthew . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} Thank you , Matthew . marketing: {vocalsound} It's a very big rat . Or a very small cat . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Perfect . {vocalsound} Oh a rat , okay . project manager: Yes , this is certain uh {disfmarker} some contribution to our project . {vocalsound} marketing: Mm 'kay . industrial designer: And you , {gap} marketing: Your turn . project manager: So . Let's see . Which animal has not been drawn yet . So you've all drawn land animals , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: so why not draw an animal from the water . industrial designer: A bird . Okay , in the water . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Ah I don't know what that is . It's a bit {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm . project manager: {vocalsound} Mm . {vocalsound} marketing: It's a bit hard to guess . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Put it colours . Maybe it would help us . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yes . user interface: The cat is going to eat the fish or the rat ? industrial designer: With different pen widths . marketing: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm.$ project manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} marketing: Oh , it's a shark now . industrial designer: Ah it's a shark , yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Oh , yes , why not ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Good idea . user interface: Ah it's a baby shark , it looks to me , marketing: Mm . user interface: you know it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish , no ? industrial designer: Oh . marketing: Now it's a swordfish . project manager: {vocalsound} Why not . A swordfish . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: You have some in {disfmarker} in Australia , right ? marketing: Swordfish . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Um , maybe . industrial designer: I dunno . marketing: I've never seen one , no . industrial designer: Oh well . Yeah . project manager: I hope it still works . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Perfect . So I dunno if we need to spend time on that , actually {vocalsound} But uh {disfmarker} user interface: You should go for the next one it seems to me . project manager: W Well , this uh this tool seemed to work . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah , exactly , yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Let's continue to uh {disfmarker} to the real stuff . industrial designer: Wow . project manager: Um our project uh finance uh thing . Uh when we are {disfmarker} and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros , so when designing a project uh I also look at you uh Mael , keep in mind uh uh uh {disfmarker} People uh user interface: Twenty four . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: want to get the feeling this is a twenty five Euro project uh pr um product . industrial designer: Per remote control , marketing: Mm . industrial designer: yeah ? Per project . project manager: Yes . Okay . Um industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: more interesting for our company {vocalsound} of course , p uh profit aim , about fifty million Euro . So we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh {vocalsound} um things . Uh we will try to uh to get at a international market uh so um it will be I think mainly Europe and uh Northern America , user interface: Ah yeah , the sale man , four million . project manager: maybe some uh Asian countries . Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents . industrial designer: {vocalsound} So it's half of the selling price , if I am good in mathematics . project manager: Yes , of course . Uh um I mean we still have to uh to make a profit , huh ? user interface: They have to sell at least four million to make a profit {vocalsound} industrial designer: Of course . marketing: Mm . {vocalsound} project manager: You all have to be paid . marketing: Mm . project manager: Excuse me ? user interface: Ah we have to make {disfmarker} we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit . Fifty mill industrial designer: Oh you're g very good in mathematics . marketing: Yes . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Yes , indeed . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Four million . project manager: So uh well I think w when we are working on the international market , uh in principle it has enough customers industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: uh so when we have a good product we uh we could uh meet this this aim , I think . So , that about finance . And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point , it has to be original , it has to be trendy , it has to be user friendly . Um , maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Of course it should have a on off button . {vocalsound} marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yes , well i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control . marketing: Mm . Yeah . user interface: Yeah , s and it depends what application you are using it for . marketing: Mm . user interface: You might need uh {disfmarker} project manager: We wer we were thinking television . Uh . marketing: Mm . user interface: We are targ targeting the television set . So , marketing: Mm . user interface: you need to record the channels . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: {vocalsound} You need to browse the {disfmarker} browse the channels in upward downward way , marketing: Mm . project manager: Yes , yes . Th th that's very handy I {disfmarker} I always miss it and {disfmarker} on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number , especially when you have a lot of channels . user interface: Uh {disfmarker} And {disfmarker} marketing: Mm . Mm . user interface: Uh , and {disfmarker} industrial designer: And uh just before starting the detailed discussion , maybe we are the marketing guy ? Or {disfmarker} marketing: I'm marketing . user interface: Marketing . industrial designer: th So you are the marketing . marketing: Yep . industrial designer: And you are in the u use user interface uh design . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yes . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So just {disfmarker} yeah I wanted to to be sure . user interface: Sure . industrial designer: And I I'm the the industrial designer marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yes . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: okay . user interface: Oh . industrial designer: Because I I don't know you very well , actually , but yeah . user interface: I'm Matthew . You know . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay . Mael . user interface: Matth s uh industrial designer: Happy to meet you . marketing: Anna . user interface: Anna . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay . It's very uh {disfmarker} project manager: A and I'm Nanne . user interface: And um uh Matthew , yeah . project manager: So {disfmarker} user interface: I thi think you know me , industrial designer: Uh so yeah uh {disfmarker} Just uh on your web page but uh yeah not uh {disfmarker} not face to face . project manager: Yes . user interface: yeah ? right yeah . project manager: So . Um {disfmarker} S user interface: So . industrial designer: {vocalsound} So mm {disfmarker} project manager: S s marketing: Mm . project manager: Are there some other very important things to to do {disfmarker} well , user interface: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} So I project manager: to specify in this first phase of of the project . So the browse function , as you m mentioned . marketing: Mm . Yeah . Oth yeah . user interface: And uh , you'd need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the the channel and then {disfmarker} you uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yes . Yeah . user interface: Today we have uh um teletext and all those things . Tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that , so {disfmarker} project manager: Yes . industrial designer: Like what ? Like internet on the on T_V_ ? marketing: Mm . user interface: Yeah I_P_O_ or . Now we are looking for television things or I_P_ . For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm . But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet . user interface: Yeah . Ah it's {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} it's coming up , actually . The personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up . project manager: Mm , well uh I I think {disfmarker} Uh w y you two should {disfmarker} should , I think , think this over uh w espec what , what functionality . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Actually , yeah user interface: Let's {disfmarker} Let's take {disfmarker} industrial designer: w {vocalsound} Of course , and first before um designing the func well thinking about the functionalities , we need to know what are the user requirements . marketing: Mm . Yeah . industrial designer: Um then if they need internet , then we would be able to to p to propose something with uh uh T_V_ over I_P_ . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Yeah . Mm . Yeah . But {disfmarker} Ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels , so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use . project manager: Mm mm mm . Keep k keep in mind i it's a {disfmarker} it's a twenty five Euro unit , so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh w we can leave that out , I think . marketing: Mm . project manager: So twenty five Euro you expect a quite , well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control . marketing: Mm . user interface: Oh in that case you can you always hook up with uh someone who is providing that and you know , {vocalsound} you {disfmarker} you sell their product as well as your product with them , you know . {vocalsound} marketing: Mm . So try and get T_V_ manufacturers to {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , but w w we want to design a new one . {vocalsound} Mm . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} No , it's okay , yeah I understand . So we need some numbering buttons , some teletext things industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: and then um {disfmarker} industrial designer: The {disfmarker} Yeah , the main is browsing . Yeah . project manager: Yes , but but but ab about the spec the buttons , the buttons uh that will be on it . I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: Uh I would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting . user interface: Okay . project manager: So {disfmarker} user interface: Okay , we are alread mm . Mm . project manager: So industrial designer: Okay . project manager: you know now the basic {disfmarker} the basic things . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . project manager: well just {disfmarker} just for the next meeting , um user interface: L project manager: well , uh , you wor yes , work on a design , keep it general , I mean {disfmarker} so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Um you will be working on {disfmarker} on technical function design , so {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , sure . project manager: And uh you {disfmarker} and you and uh uh uh well , think about requirements , marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: eh ? Does it need internet , or or do do we stay at basic basic television uh interface . user interface: Stam . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So , uh I think we should now all go work uh uh at this marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Okay . project manager: So next meeting will be in uh {disfmarker} in thirty minutes uh . industrial designer: Perfect . project manager: K keep it in mind .
