Well , the opening is what I'm doing right now . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh , we gonna do some acquaintance acquaintance things . Uh give some um examples of the tool training , project plan discussion and the closing . We have twenty five minutes . Okay , the project aim is to design a new remote control . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Uh , some of the {vocalsound} oje objectives are that is has to be original , trendy , and user-friendly . So now we all know what our user interface: Okay . project manager: goal is . Um , I {disfmarker} oh forget {disfmarker} I forget the whole acquaintance part , but we we all know each other . We all know each other's names . Joost , Guido , Antek . user interface: What is your name ? marketing: Yes . industrial designer: Yes . Antek . user interface: Antek Ahmet . And Joost . {gap} project manager: Okay . I think we uh al already uh been through that part . user interface: Okay . Yeah . project manager: Okay , it consists of uh three levels of design . Uh we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design . Every uh level of design consists of some individual work , and we uh close it with a meeting . You all received an email with a example of our explanation of what uh the particular level of design uh means to the different uh functions , and uh you p you probably read that already , so I don't have to tell you about that . user interface: Yes . marketing: Yes . project manager: Okay , first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools . We have the smart-boards , uh the thes those two boards . This is the presentation boards , wh which one I'm using right now . You can uh um {disfmarker} there's a document folder called um the sh {vocalsound} shared document folder . You can upload your uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here , so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen . We also have the white-board . Uh , we're gonna skip through th user interface: Can we see the white-board on our laptops ? project manager: No , no . Just on the on the screen over there . user interface: No , I saw I saw the file , the smart-board that X_B_K_ but {disfmarker} project manager: Oh , no . Probably is , but I don't know if the software is on the laptop {gap} . Is is {disfmarker} if it's mainly a thing for in the meeting , so I don't think it's {disfmarker} I don't know if it's important . user interface: Okay . project manager: This an explanation of the smart-boards . There is a tool-bar over here . It's quite simple . You have the the pen function , eraser function . It's like a very simple uh paint application . Uh , we {disfmarker} well , we use the same file during uh the whole day , and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button . It works like this . Oh . {vocalsound} If pen is selected , yes . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Oh , no no . user interface: With that pen ? project manager: It's not {disfmarker} But it is pen . It's not working like a pen yet . user interface: Mm . project manager: Huh . Huh . user interface: Mm . project manager: It's doing some stuff now . So you can use a pen . user interface: Little bit slower . project manager: You can use an eraser . And you can make new uh fi uh new blanks , and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward , which y you have to select pen format . And then select current colour or line width . So , it's quite easy . Uh well , now you're all uh acquainted with the different tools . Right , we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards . Uh , every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: on blank sheets with different colours , with different pen widths . Uh , I'll start off then . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: I'll use this uh same sheet . Alright . Oh , let me think . Different colours . Oh . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Well , I'm gonna draw um a p piranha . Uh , a fish . user interface: {vocalsound} piranha . Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: Mm-hmm . I'm gonna use some different colour {gap} now . user interface: Oh . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Some {disfmarker} a little white . Looks like a fish . Think it is . Oh . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Oh . {vocalsound} Uh , colour . This is black ? I think so . user interface: Yellow {gap} {disfmarker} project manager: Oh . Oh , this is just uh {vocalsound} useless uh drawings but {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Oh teeth . I need teeth . {vocalsound} Well , they're not supposed to be green , or whatever colour this is . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Hmm . project manager: Okay . What was uh {disfmarker} I have su to sum up its favourite characteris user interface: Different . project manager: Well , I like its uh sharp {disfmarker} razor sharp teeth . {vocalsound} Plus , uh the the big uh forehead and uh a small uh , well a small actual face . And I like its overall uh aggressive look and {disfmarker} Well , that's what I like about uh piranha . I think that's kind of what uh the intention should be . user interface: Okay . project manager: Well , who wants to be next ? marketing: Nobody , I guess . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} I will try . Yeah . I will try . Uh {disfmarker} project manager: You go , Guido ? Okay . Uh , make a new sheet . Uh , it's by pressing on blank . user interface: Blank ? project manager: Yep . user interface: Okay . Then pen again ? marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yep . user interface: Okay . project manager: And uh {disfmarker} so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths . user interface: Okay , um {disfmarker} marketing: Format . user interface: {gap} control . Uh {disfmarker} Ah , purple . Um , I don't know what my uh favourite uh animal is , marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: but the easiest animal I can think is is a bird . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Uh I will {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} You know , I thought of that actually . user interface: That's my bird . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: Isn't it quite {disfmarker} it's a little bit light . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Uh , another colour maybe . A red one . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: A small one . Uh , line width . Two ? Three . Oh that's okay . That's another one . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Well , tell us something about uh your favourite characteristics of these uh particular birds . user interface: {vocalsound} Ano {vocalsound} Uh {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} it's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Its simplicity . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , it's uh the most simple uh animal I know , I think . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Um , I don't know . Maybe because uh there's there's some s uh free uh maybe in the sky or something like that . project manager: Oh , okay . Okay . user interface: Maybe a little bit . Yeah . I don't know . project manager: Okay . No , uh it's clear . user interface: So {gap} more uh birds ? project manager: N no {vocalsound} no . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: We get your point . Okay . Who wants to be next ? user interface: {vocalsound} {gap} Okay , {vocalsound} okay , {vocalsound} okay . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , whatever . I'll go next . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Thanks . user interface: M marketing: I haven't got a favourite animal too , so {disfmarker} user interface: Pictionary . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Oh . {vocalsound} What should I draw ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Oh . user interface: A cow . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: Thank you , project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: I'll draw a penguin . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} I'll draw a penguin . Whatever . I can't draw , so you can start to laugh already . project manager: {vocalsound} I'll do so . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Whatever . Something like that . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: Come on . user interface: Yeah , it's little bit hard . marketing: Mm hmm hmm , orange . user interface: Orange , of course . marketing: Whatever . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Oh , {vocalsound} it's better than your bird . user interface: {gap} Uh yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Everything's better than your bird . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} True . marketing: Whatever . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Hey , it's blue .

The way it walks or whatever . project manager: Okay . marketing: Your turn . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: 'Kay . {vocalsound} marketing: Drawing . {vocalsound} industrial designer: I'm going to draw a cat . I don't know why , but a cat is a very uh smart animal . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: And you can have them at home . user interface: {gap} industrial designer: Which is not as the case with uh with bingwings and {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Well , you can have a piranha at home . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Ye yes , {vocalsound} yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Huh . marketing: Or a line . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: A little bit . {vocalsound} marketing: I mean a bird . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} Don't mess with my birds , yeah . industrial designer: It's not very uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} very good drawn , but you can see a cat from it . {vocalsound} marketing: Hmm . It's a handicapped cat . user interface: {vocalsound} {gap} cat . project manager: I don't think uh I don't think uh Darwin would agree with that . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} It's {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Ah , it's not scared . He's crying but {disfmarker} project manager: {gap} . Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} He's crying because it's ugl because of his ugliness . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} What do you like about it then ? marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Uh it's i most cats are small . project manager: Oh , okay . industrial designer: You can handle them . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . Okay . Okay , user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: and then we are uh through the tool training , I guess . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} I wouldn't call it training , but {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , this is uh something about the project finance . The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros . And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros . We're very ambitious on this one . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: The market range is international , so it's gonna be sold world-wide , and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control . So that's clear . {gap} {disfmarker} Yeah ? user interface: Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} Alright . project manager: Okay , we're now gonna discuss some stuff when {disfmarker} well , we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be . Uh , well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls . Do you have uh {disfmarker} know what good experiences with remote controls ? Or do they annoy you sometimes ? industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Are they difficult to understand , or maybe they don't interact with different kind of uh equipment very well ? user interface: Hmm . marketing: I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls , project manager: Yeah , okay . marketing: but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever . user interface: Different . project manager: Okay . marketing: And then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places , and half of the functions a are removed , or whatever . Uh , so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with uh grouped buttons , you know . All th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one uh {disfmarker} project manager: Different functions of of uh {disfmarker} marketing: Well , one area or whatever , not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to um , yeah , to minimise it to this this {vocalsound} {disfmarker} or whatever o o other functions {vocalsound} totally somewhere else . project manager: Okay . Yeah . marketing: I think we should group them . project manager: Okay . marketing: And same for the for the volume buttons and the the t project manager: And uh , is it gonna be a remote control that's um {disfmarker} what it can be used for different kind of equipment , like your T_V_ and your home stereo ? marketing: Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . But uh , the D_V_D_ players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi-fi sets probably . marketing: Yeah . project manager: It's what , from my experience . user interface: But isn't it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: I don't know . Hi-fi set is uh not often used uh as I know of in combination with television . project manager: Okay . But we gonna {disfmarker} user interface: It's only for television , I thought . Not {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Yes . project manager: Oh , it is only for televis user interface: {gap} I thought it was only for television . So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_ . marketing: Yes , it is only for television , but uh {disfmarker} project manager: So wha what {disfmarker} What wha {vocalsound} what uh what document {disfmarker} marketing: Well {disfmarker} well we we're gonna brainstorm about that . If we think it's useful , we do it . project manager: But , where where did it uh {disfmarker} Where did you find that ? user interface: Uh , in the email . project manager: Oh , okay . user interface: I thought it said uh {disfmarker} marketing: That's right . It's a television remote control . user interface: Yeah , television remote control . industrial designer: Yes , {gap} {disfmarker} marketing: But I was thinking since it is useful with D_V_D_ {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , but most television remote controls support other functions as well . So we can {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes , that's uh something extras . project manager: No , we have to think about that . user interface: True . Yeah . project manager: Okay , uh but uh we've gonna put some a uh is is it so user-friendliness , is a is a pri priority in this case , or {disfmarker} user interface: True . marketing: Yep . user interface: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , also no one's gonna buy it . project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah . True . industrial designer: Only the experts . {vocalsound} marketing: I guess . project manager: Well , this the maybe is uh some aspect of the {disfmarker} uh , or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful . industrial designer: {gap} marketing: Yeah . project manager: That w Well , then you're you're the usability uh man , so this uh gonna be a very important task for you then . user interface: {vocalsound} Oh my God . Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Okay . Well , other ideas ? How can we make it trendy or something ? Do uh by just sh shape and the look of it ? industrial designer: Uh , to go with to go with fashion and {disfmarker} project manager: Maybe a can opener underneath it ? user interface: {vocalsound} For the bear . Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} I don't know . Or someth something special , like uh M_P_ three player inside of it , or uh {disfmarker} user interface: I I uh , no I think it {disfmarker} project manager: Oh , well then the production costs are gonna be too high probably . user interface: Uh , I th I think yo we have to keep it simple , to get a whole market . marketing: Yeah , way too high . Yep . project manager: Okay . Maybe with different type of fronts or uh {disfmarker} user interface: It's international , so we have to use a standard . project manager: Well , m has to be something {vocalsound} spectacular or uh one which makes it {disfmarker} marketing: Well that's an idea of course , yeah . project manager: We gonna skip back to the goals probably . Uh , marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: original , trendly , and user-friendly {disfmarker} Well , we al also already talked about user-friendliness . user interface: Hmm . project manager: No , well something trendy and original , well that that goes hand in hand I guess . When something is original , it tends to be trendy , probably , marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: or we should make it combination of that . 'Kay , so you {vocalsound} {disfmarker} the um technical part of the process is something you're gonna look after for , so you have to think about what kind of uh equipment you want to uh , you know , you want to manage with it . Well , and that's an important part for you then , with gogors regards to the user-friendly part of it . user interface: Use friendly . Yep . project manager: Well , and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy . {vocalsound} Well , you know , y like some special feature . Or some {disfmarker} {gap} Does it does it gets some gadgetness or something . marketing: Yeah . Yes , what the market wishes . project manager: Okay . Well , the closing . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . Individual , I think so . The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design , of course , we will uh {disfmarker} Already s said that . The User Interface Designer {vocalsound} {disfmarker} is it a User Inter User Interface {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . Yeah , yeah .
