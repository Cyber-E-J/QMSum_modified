project manager: Wait for the marketing director actually , so . Anyways . Uh . See , shall we wait ? I'm not sure if he's late or delayed or whatever , so I'm gonna start soon , we have now {disfmarker} don't have much time anyway . user interface: Oh , there he is . industrial designer: Okay , marketing: Yes . project manager: There you are , industrial designer: we {disfmarker} marketing: Sorry , project manager: okay . marketing: a little bit of pl little problem with computer . project manager: Uh no problem . We're about to start , so have a seat . Okay , welcome again . marketing: {vocalsound} {gap} . project manager: Today , functional design phase . I'll take you over the minutes of last last meeting . Okay , that was just to get to know each other , marketing: Uh . project manager: have a little thoughts on what your vision is and {disfmarker} on this project , so {disfmarker} I put the minutes on the {disfmarker} I made on the on the p the the project share , so if you wanna review them , they're there . I will do so after every meeting , so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there . Anyways , um today three presentations , from every one of you . Um after that I got some new project requirements from project board , so we're gonna go af go after {disfmarker} over this later . But I wanna start with uh stuff you did first , so we can see what everybody came up with . And after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts , so . Who would like {disfmarker} wanna go first ? marketing: Yeah , sure , no problem . project manager: Take it . user interface: Go ahead . marketing: Um there was a little problem with my computer so not uh the whole uh presentation uh {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Anyway , let's see what you have . marketing: Yeah . Um {disfmarker} Okay , project manager: Uh it's still a bit open . marketing: I want to open the my s oh no . project manager: You should close it on your own notebook , I guess . Yeah . So there ? marketing: Oh no , project manager: Okay . marketing: that's okay . Uh slide show . Yes . The functional requirements , it's uh {vocalsound} uh very important for uh the user , he he wants to {disfmarker} yeah . The the method we used uh it it's not m not a slide , because it went wrong , but the method we use uh , um {vocalsound} we tested it w uh with uh a hundred uh men , and we asked them to w uh what the remote uh f feel uh like and uh what what's uh important . Uh {disfmarker} project manager: If I can cut in , is it people or men ? {vocalsound} marketing: People , project manager: Is it people , okay . marketing: sorry . project manager: 'Cause I thought it was only men , marketing: Both women and men , project manager: so {disfmarker} marketing: yeah . project manager: 'Kay . marketing: Okay . Uh the findings um uh {vocalsound} seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly . Um {disfmarker} user interface: That's pretty shocking uh . {vocalsound} project manager: So we have to s we have to do something about that . marketing: Yeah , and {disfmarker} yeah , most th th they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control , so we can do uh a l a little uh nice things with it , and um they use {disfmarker} yeah , they use zap a lot , um uh fifty percent say they only {disfmarker} So that's the most important things . project manager: Okay . marketing: Um {disfmarker} oh yeah , not all of it is it on mine on my PowerPoint presentation , project manager: Okay , just talk ahead . marketing: but um uh the relevant buttons are the power , the channel selection and the volume selection . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: It's uh the most basic buttons that a user wants uh {vocalsound} to use . Uh less important is tel teletext , project manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} marketing: uh um they use it , but it's not uh very uh important uh on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half uh project manager: Okay , that's okay . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: and {disfmarker} but not important is the channel selection , the the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} hmm ? project manager: That's a little weird . marketing: Oh , {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Which channel selection ? marketing: the the {disfmarker} no no no no no , that's very important , but uh w and not important in the audio settings , display settings project manager: Okay , marketing: and uh {disfmarker} project manager: we can we can hide those under a menu or something , user interface: Oh , okay . marketing: Yeah . project manager: okay . marketing: {vocalsound} Um new preferences preferences . Uh um um beep to find your control , was {disfmarker} project manager: That's like a button on your T_V_ ? marketing: that was {gap} in the test , the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control , project manager: Remote , okay . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it . And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition um so they can say uh what they want to {disfmarker} let's go to channel one and uh that's uh kind of things . project manager: Okay . marketing: And they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen um to to look it um wh what's on every channel uh and uh what do I want with it ? user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: We wanna have a little preview on the remote control . Preview what's on the channel . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Okay . user interface: Is that manageable ? 'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too . project manager: That sounds too {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: It's possible , but uh I think it's expensive , but do continue . user interface: Okay . marketing: Yeah . Um {disfmarker} Uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel , so I can uh I dunno , so I can zap to my uh f uh quick uh to my favourite channel wh what I uh {disfmarker} so , the remote mu must see or um must um {vocalsound} see wha what mine preferences are for which channel , project manager: Okay , you don't set it yourself , marketing: so I can zap t to {disfmarker} project manager: it just remembers the channel that you are on most , for example . marketing: What ? project manager: You want the {disfmarker} you want it to be programmed , for example y programmed f marketing: Yeah . project manager: or you want it to recognise your favourite channel ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: Let's see , you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel , marketing: Recognise {disfmarker} project manager: so it recognises your favourite channel . marketing: Yeah . Yeah , that's uh what my personal preference like . project manager: Okay , so it's it it does {disfmarker} it recognise itself , you don't have to set it {disfmarker} marketing: No , project manager: Okay . marketing: itself . Maybe it's easier to {vocalsound} to sell it , but {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . marketing: I don't know it's manageable , but we will uh we will see . project manager: I see . marketing: Yeah , it's a little bit uh it's the end of it . project manager: Okay . marketing: It's a little bit uh I lost it , user interface: Okay . marketing: the computer uh crashed , project manager: {vocalsound} No problem , it's it's okay , marketing: so . project manager: that's {disfmarker} Yeah , go ahead . user interface: Shall I go ? Okay . marketing: Yeah . user interface: So , some technical functions . marketing: Darn computer . user interface: Basically I have some issues which you discussed earlier . Uh let's just start with the method . marketing: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} It sounds really easy , what does the user do , what does the th remote control do , but there are quite some issues . So the things I'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect , because the technical aspect , that's pretty much covered . We can do that . What goes wrong {vocalsound} at the user . Gets the remote control . Where is the remote control ? We've all had it once , I want to watch some television , marketing: Yeah . user interface: where's the remote control ? That was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder , marketing: Yeah . project manager: That seems very good . user interface: a really good idea . Uh these are just the issues . I come to some uh personal experience , findings , possible solutions later . Searches for the button . There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear . Uh so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while . marketing: Mm uh . user interface: There's nothing more annoying than faded symbols , because you don't know which channel is this button , so possibly we could find uh something for that , project manager: Okay , so have it more {disfmarker} make it more durable actually . Okay . user interface: yes . Uh covered that . Oh yes , user presses the button . Um usually when you have a lot of buttons , buttons are small . So you press more once remote control goes kablouey or something like that , project manager: Okay , so the buttons should be {disfmarker} user interface: so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on uh the remote control . {vocalsound} project manager: Mm-hmm . Yeah . user interface: And possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger project manager: Wow . The s Yeah . Make it {disfmarker} make them bigger . user interface: si project manager: Even more durable uh . user interface: So this is basically what I h had in mind in the {disfmarker} fade-proof symbols , locator , a sound , uh so clear we should stick to existing symbols , but maybe we could do a little uh investigation to see whether some symbols are uh {disfmarker} need to be replaced by others . Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . user interface: This I pretty much covered . {vocalsound} So what we want to go to is not this one , project manager: Yeah , it's true . user interface: but more {disfmarker} less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons . marketing: Yeah . user interface: that's basically uh what I had in mind . So project manager: Yeah , that's clear . user interface: This is not the final design , project manager: No , of course uh {disfmarker} user interface: this is just a general idea of how I'd like to see uh basically the general idea . project manager: Yeah . I must say that it {disfmarker} Hmm . user interface: {vocalsound} So that was it . project manager: That was it . Okay , that was good . So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it {disfmarker} the durability of of the thing , user interface: Yeah , I think it's a really good idea . project manager: so {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: The other aspects , we'll just see how {disfmarker} what you came up with and what's possible for that budget . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Okay , that's fine . Um . Okay , now work a little with me . Okay . Well , project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: let's start it as it is . Okay , uh the method . There are a few questions that need to be answered , uh you already uh talked about it a little bit . Which buttons are wanted , uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable . Uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it . Because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: And uh how big is the remote control uh going to be ? I'll tell you why that's important to me . Um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control , so uh uh that's {vocalsound} why I also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs , uh I heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens , but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: So keep in mind that everything that you keep uh {disfmarker} think of , it has to b to be built . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} Of course , hmm . industrial designer: So it's {disfmarker} that's not as easy as it s might look like . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Uh material study , I'm working on that um for the the costs . I have to check out how far I can go with that . Normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper . Uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way , I think we can just go on with that . Um then I've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production . The more we can make uh at once uh in one piece , uh that is cheaper . project manager: You mean integrate them all into the circuit board . Okay . industrial designer: Exactly , so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that's cheaper . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , okay . industrial designer: So we have to {vocalsound} make something that's not too difficult in design again . project manager: So you have {disfmarker} industrial designer: This is what look like uh looks like if you press one button , so this is not the entire thing . You have the the power coming in , then you have like a switch . The switch uh uh {vocalsound} uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a Morse code , that's how you should see it . The Morse code goes to the amplifier , then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs . You have infrared and an interv um {vocalsound} uh how to say it ? Uh a light in indication , light that you know that it's functioning . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Uh here again , that's my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote uh universal , then the processor has to uh make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed . That makes it much more complex , so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not . Uh I don't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far , except for uh the materials to be used uh light , that they are light . project manager: Okay . Okay . That was it ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} That was it . project manager: I'll get back to my thing then . Uh {disfmarker} Okay , back this up {disfmarker} to the screen . So I got some new information on the project specifications are changing a little . Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore because the uh the internet , nowadays people don't use the teletext anymore or hardly , so it can either {disfmarker} Well , I don't think we should remove the button , because there are always people who are using it . user interface: Yeah . project manager: But I don't think it should be {vocalsound} very {disfmarker} it should be one of the big buttons for example . Just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever . It's not important anymore . Um we're targeting young people now , because our um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people , marketing: Uh . project manager: which are {disfmarker} um the younger people were defined under forty . marketing: Yeah . project manager: I so I think it's {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: that's also good with the fashion and everything , marketing: B project manager: so yeah . marketing: Yeah , and they want to pay for it project manager: They want to pay for it , people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like . marketing: and uh {disfmarker} project manager: If they like the way it looks , the way it functions , so they're actually gonna spend uh spend money on it . marketing: With more {disfmarker} Where {disfmarker} with more technical specifications project manager: Yeah . marketing: in the {disfmarker} project manager: {gap} {vocalsound} see how far we can go with it anyway , so marketing: Yeah . project manager: {disfmarker} And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , which is apparently {vocalsound} black and yellow , but {disfmarker} I'm not sure if we {disfmarker} I think we should keep the the logo in mind , because with colours you can uh have a lot of uh fashionable colours and everything on it , which suits everybody's taste . So {disfmarker} With that concept I started thinking , so why not just steal Nokia's idea and just make changeable covers for your {disfmarker} user interface: Oh . project manager: I mean those cost hardly anything I think , and people could even spend extra money on buying a cover industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see . Or we can sh for example we can make a different {vocalsound} {disfmarker} a basic design . And sell the covers separately , for example . That's just a little marketing idea that could be applied , so you can p it appeals to really everyone . So you don't have to {disfmarker} I think you don't have to make entire remote controls . We make a basic one and manufacture this cover separately . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: So that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone . So industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: just {disfmarker} I'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime , after making a presentation . Would you like to share ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: No , I think this is a good idea . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: But {disfmarker} marketing: But {disfmarker} oh ? user interface: Is it manageable ? Is it easy ? industrial designer: Go ahead . marketing: Yeah , with with an L_C_D_ screen you can {disfmarker} project manager: Oh yeah . I think we should lose the L_C_D_ screen , industrial designer: Y Yes , I think so too . project manager: like you said . I think for example it's it's huge {disfmarker} I think the L_C_D_ is huge , user interface: Yeah . marketing: Why ? Nokia w project manager: it consumes batteries like hell . marketing: Uh . project manager: I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power . user interface: And it costs too much to fabricate , project manager: It costs a lot , I think . user interface: so we're on a tight budget here . industrial designer: Okay , uh {disfmarker} project manager: What we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an L_C_D_ screen but with a preview , marketing: Okay . project manager: but y I'm not sure if it's even possible {vocalsound} . For example , a little T_V_ guide . industrial designer: Mm . project manager: Like you have a little {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: just just a text only , not colour , just a little text thing industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: Yeah . project manager: so you can use your remote as a T_V_ guide . I'm not sure it's even possible , industrial designer: Hmm . I have to check that out , project manager: but maybe okay , make it {disfmarker} industrial designer: I'm not sure . project manager: Yeah , find a little compromise in that , but {disfmarker} What did I write down ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: I think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , just make a button on your T_V_ industrial designer: That must be possible . project manager: and just hit the button , it beeps somewhere . I think it's easy to implement , industrial designer: Ja . project manager: we should go for that . industrial designer: I'm sorry , project manager: Uh speech recognition . user interface: And it's {disfmarker} industrial designer: whe where do you wanna hit the T_ {disfmarker} you wanna {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we want a button on the television . {gap} project manager: I thin {vocalsound} Yeah , I mean where else should you put it ? industrial designer: In th okay , but that rules out a universal remote control . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Because that's not possible uh . project manager: but {vocalsound} how are you gonna use that if your {disfmarker} I mean if your remote control is lost , how are you gonna press {disfmarker} where are you gonna press the button ? industrial designer: Uh . Yeah . Exactly . user interface: Maybe just a slap-on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal . project manager: A slap-on sticker . Oh , you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your T_V_ . marketing: Mm uh . project manager: Yeah , that could be possible . user interface: Yeah , exactly . project manager: A little little box you can attach to your T_V_ is fine then , okay . industrial designer: Okay , then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not , because that's uh determines everything I'm gonna do . project manager: I think it's universal . I think we should go for universal , industrial designer: If not {disfmarker} project manager: because apparently we're a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: I think universal remote control should be possible . marketing: Yeah . Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay , then I go for that . marketing: Everyone uh wants to buy it , so we w project manager: Yeah , I think we're targeting everyone , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: so remote {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . No , marketing: yeah . industrial designer: it's fine with me , but then I know what to look for . project manager: Okay , universal is good . Speech recognition , I think it's very hard , because we're selling across multiple countries . So I think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus , it's very hard to do . marketing: Yeah . Or one . user interface: And it's {disfmarker} marketing: Or when you say one two uh i it uh it's enough , project manager: Yeah , but I don't see Arabian people speaking one , two uh whatever . marketing: right ? But {disfmarker} Oh yeah . user interface: Besides that , the technology isn't really super yet , so that {vocalsound} is a problem in implementing this . project manager: It's {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: It's not a mature technology , I think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control , marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: so {disfmarker} user interface: It's a good idea , but it's just not {disfmarker} I don't think the market's ripe for that yet . project manager: I don't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh . industrial designer: Uh-huh . project manager: What else do we have ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: Um well you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable . So the the the symbols won't fade , industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: maybe a little harder plastic industrial designer: Exactly . project manager: or especially li we don't {disfmarker} industrial designer: I already noted that . project manager: maybe we don't have have to do all the buttons , but especially the ones that are um the popular buttons , so those always fade first . industrial designer: Mm , okay . Okay . project manager: Mm the thing is the most important things that we have now . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: Let's see . industrial designer: If we uh make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make uh a cover for every language area . project manager: For example ? industrial designer: That's fo {vocalsound} is uh especially for older people , that they can read it read it in their own language . project manager: Well , we're not we're not targeting older people , marketing: Yeah . project manager: we should remember that . Everything we target is under forty , industrial designer: That's {disfmarker} project manager: so . industrial designer: okay , okay . project manager: You assume that that they read correctly and I think they're {disfmarker} industrial designer: Huh . project manager: The most important thing about young people is that they're really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world , marketing: But b project manager: so {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh okay . user interface: But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or just the {disfmarker} project manager: No , of course . No , I think it's just something you you put over them , because {disfmarker} Yeah we c Yeah , you ca Well , industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: tha that's not a that's not a bad {disfmarker} that's not even {disfmarker} user interface: C marketing: But every {disfmarker} user interface: that's a problem with the with the text then . project manager: it's not even a bad idea . I mean , for example , if you're if you're into the durability issue you could {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: For example , if your buttons are faded , after {disfmarker} I mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover . industrial designer: Mm . project manager: Uh I'm not sure it's it's hard to make . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: So it's a good and a bad idea . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Uh but I know that the buttons are like a Nokia telephone on uh one sleeve , project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: so you don't have to change your whole cover . Uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve . user interface: Oh yeah , I know what you mean . industrial designer: Know what I mean ? marketing: Oh . industrial designer: It works the same as a Nokia telephone , it's it's in my uh {disfmarker} 'kay . project manager: Yeah , I know , it's just just a one one piece of rubber for example , marketing: Yeah . project manager: okay . Yeah , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Exactly . project manager: that's what I {disfmarker} something I have to look into . Either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover , I'm not sure which which is easier , industrial designer: Hmm . {vocalsound} project manager: so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um anyway , yeah , this is what we're gonna do afterwards , just lunch break and have more individual work after that , so let's see what we {disfmarker} let's see we {disfmarker} So you have to come up with a components concept , yeah . I want some {disfmarker} you should do some trend-watching , because even if we're if we're gonna do those covers and everything , what people really want , that's what we need to know in this phase , marketing: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: because that's gonna be the essential final design that we're gonna come up with . marketing: Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Yeah , I think user interface is fairly obvious . I mean it should be very intuitive , user interface: Pretty straightforward . project manager: s Yeah , it should speak for itself . Uh for example I bought a remote control last week with a new T_V_ , it was it l it's like all buttons and you have no idea what it does at first , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: and I'm {gap} total T_V_ new , anyway . So I think it should be {disfmarker} have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second {vocalsound} second level menu for the advanced things . Or maybe just stick 'em under a menu , like you said the um {vocalsound} the sound options and the surround and whatever , they're more complicated , just stick 'em under one menu and uh give it a {disfmarker} just put it in in s in a software piece , you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your T_V_ . industrial designer: Mm . user interface: Is it techni technically possible to uh {vocalsound} send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu , project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: because we're working with different types of television , so we're going to work with that ? project manager: That is true . industrial designer: I don't think so . project manager: No , that's true . industrial designer: No , I don't think so . Because the television needs to respond to the signal , project manager: Yeah , that's true . user interface: It's an in-built menu , industrial designer: and if it doesn't know how , it's {disfmarker} user interface: isn't it ? Yes . industrial designer: Exactly , that's not possible . user interface: So basically project manager: I'm not sure if it's impossible , user interface: we {disfmarker} project manager: but uh there's a chance it's not , so . user interface: Or we could use a double-sided {disfmarker} for {vocalsound} less used functions project manager: A double-sided remote control ? user interface: you {disfmarker} project manager: I don't think that's useful . user interface: Yeah , with the cover . {vocalsound} I it's basically an idea to overcome these issues , project manager: Yeah , but then you're gonna have a lot of wasted buttons . user interface: because {disfmarker} project manager: For example you have a Sony T_V_ and the half of the buttons won't function if you have a {disfmarker} for a Sony that won't {disfmarker} for a Philips T_V_ . industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: No , but basic functions {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: but functions which are not frequently used . project manager: I don't think we should {disfmarker} user interface: Because if we use a universal remote control , we're going to have to have most buttons on it , project manager: Yeah , for exam user interface: so {disfmarker} project manager: I'm not s marketing: Mm yeah . project manager: yeah , for ex you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that {disfmarker} it should do what people usually do with their T_V_s , not not the very complicated settings industrial designer: Mm . project manager: that you can usually do that with uh either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing , industrial designer: Mm . project manager: but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s . industrial designer: But that might be broken . project manager: I think there's I think there is a standard for example between uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {gap} Hmm . project manager: because usually the the menu is {disfmarker} the menu button is is usable between different brands . Especially the big ones , the big brands , industrial designer: Hmm . Hmm . project manager: so . 'Cause everybody {disfmarker} I have a universal remote control and it can use the menu button , so I think {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: I'm not sure , if you can put some research into that , if it's possible . Uh I think just a b industrial designer: Mm okay . {vocalsound} project manager: and the navigation is very basic , it's usually the same thing . industrial designer: Mm . But I think there must be a way uh to invoke the more complicated functions of a television . For instance , if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours , then uh you should be able to get everything out of the television that's in it . project manager: Yeah . Yeah , that's true . I think so user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Because otherwise you'll lose functions by buying our {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: uh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu , I think it's possible , just the way how to . industrial designer: Okay , I thi I think so too . marketing: Yeah , yeah . project manager: Yeah , then then you could do everything I suppose , because usually the T_V_s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software , so it's okay . industrial designer: And I think that our r remote control should not look like uh any other . For instance uh Sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices , project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: and you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same , only the labels are different . project manager: Yeah . Yeah I think it should be a little distinct from everything else , industrial designer: We should not do that . project manager: because it's {disfmarker} either it's both {gap} mayb industrial designer: Exactly . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , project manager: maybe the shape can be a little different . user interface: I have some ideas . I have some ideas . project manager: Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever . industrial designer: Mm that's your uh division . {vocalsound} marketing: Um {disfmarker} yeah . And uh with different colours uh . project manager: So um {disfmarker} user interface: I'll put some on paper and present them next time uh the ideas that I have . project manager: Yeah , this {gap} . Not sure what {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . project manager: because we have forty minutes , I'm not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway , so . user interface: I heard a beep go . project manager: Yeah , but it wasn't me , it was him closing something . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So anyway , yeah , we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example . I mean what do you want , do you want {gap} , but {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , but we like some some curves or {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , may maybe something like this . But though smooth inside . So you have the transmitter here for example . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Let's see that you {disfmarker} what would be handy . I think that the {vocalsound} the buttons should be {disfmarker} the channel buttons should be {vocalsound} uh on their own . marketing: Uh . And a light uh {disfmarker} project manager: Let's see one , two {disfmarker} God damn it . user interface: Oh , we get the general ideas , yes . project manager: Yeah , okay . {vocalsound} Another one here . Let's see what {disfmarker} I think this should {disfmarker} these are always on top of the of the control , so they should be here . industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: Yeah , and since you're holding it like this , I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume {disfmarker} project manager: Think it's like this . {vocalsound} marketing: Volume . project manager: Withi within the {disfmarker} Yeah , just take it . user interface: yeah yeah . So you have the up channel {vocalsound} the down channel {disfmarker} the volume , do we want that horizontal or vertical ? project manager: Do you take triangles or {disfmarker} marketing: Uh it's it's fine , I think . project manager: Um I think it should be I think it {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: This is basically what people are accustomed to , project manager: Maybe we should make 'em bigger or whatever . user interface: so {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , but this is just a g general idea . marketing: Oh d {gap} project manager: Yeah . user interface: Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle . project manager: Yeah , in the middle . It's it's usually uh there , but {disfmarker} Mm . user interface: Whoa . industrial designer: Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you {disfmarker} if it's lost , for people that are deaf . They they won't hear the the beep . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but for example if it's lost in your armchair , we'll not see the flash . user interface: You won't be able to find it . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: And flash takes up a lot of batteries again . industrial designer: Uh . Yeah , it's true , but it's it's only has to do so when you press the button that it's lost . marketing: Just {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . user interface: We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you {disfmarker} that some light lights up . industrial designer: So . {gap} deaf people ? marketing: And L_E_D_ uh on it . project manager: Yeah , I thought about for deaf people for example , so . We could do that . Uh let's see . marketing: Just a light on it or {disfmarker} user interface: So we have the basic channels we've got here , uh the power button somewhere over here ? project manager: Oh yeah , it's true . Um that thing should be central . marketing: Very important . project manager: You shouldn't be {disfmarker} you uh shouldn't press it by accident , but it shouldn't be stacked away somewhere . marketing: Oh , user interface: I usually press it on top . marketing: that's {disfmarker} It's {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . user interface: At least that's what I'm accustomed to . industrial designer: {vocalsound} I have another idea , project manager: Yeah , like that's gonna work . {vocalsound} industrial designer: I'm not sure if it's possible . marketing: And {disfmarker} user interface: What would you like to {gap} ? project manager: Yeah , I thought maybe we should move the buttons down marketing: But you r project manager: and put it here for example marketing: And you are reading from the t project manager: to {disfmarker} marketing: you always read from the top to the the bottom of it . project manager: From top to bottom . Yeah , that's true , marketing: Yeah , project manager: you should {disfmarker} marketing: so it's {disfmarker} project manager: I think the bu the power button should be on top , industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Yeah . project manager: 'cause it's the first thing you do {vocalsound} , turn it on . So power button on top . Um {disfmarker} user interface: Okay , mute button . Is that somewhere here ? project manager: Mute . Do we hardly {disfmarker} I think it should be at the bottom somewhere . user interface: Is that used often ? marketing: So i it's {disfmarker} user interface: The mute button ? Do people use that often ? marketing: sorry ? project manager: Mute . Turn the sound off . marketing: No , it's {disfmarker} no . {vocalsound} user interface: 'Cause uh I'm pretty much accustomed to it {vocalsound} right over here , at least in general , marketing: Uh . Hmm . user interface: but {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} I don't think it's important , {gap} but I think it I think it should be {disfmarker} you c user interface: It's not that important , no . project manager: you could put it somewhere here . marketing: Or or with the volume selection . {vocalsound} project manager: No , because it {disfmarker} Yeah , people are accustomed to that , marketing: {vocalsound} Around uh not uh not at top at the {disfmarker} around the volume selection . project manager: it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Can I have that ? That's j user interface: Sure . marketing: I don't know where exactly , project manager: Take this out and here see {disfmarker} marketing: but {disfmarker} project manager: Uh are we gonna take triangles anyway ? I'm drawing triangles , but {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: That's pretty much what people are accustomed to , project manager: Yeah , user interface: aren't they ? project manager: it's maybe a bigger lesser than thing . So anyway , I think this is {disfmarker} should be the channels and {disfmarker} or sh user interface: Well , marketing: Wha user interface: I'm accustomed to the channels being on top . marketing: No . Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Here , industrial designer: Yeah , me too . project manager: okay . Okay , marketing: Yeah , that's better . project manager: should we chan marketing: On the right . project manager: okay , {vocalsound} this two , channel up and down . industrial designer: Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote ? That you don't have to buy new batteries if every {disfmarker} project manager: Well , marketing: Yeah . project manager: for {disfmarker} that is it's on one part it's um it's a good thing to recharge it {disfmarker} marketing: Maybe it's more ex expensive . industrial designer: Mm , yeah . project manager: Maybe we should {disfmarker} what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example . industrial designer: Uh . project manager: You have {disfmarker} just put Penlite batteries that are rechargeable , because it's an it's it's it's very annoying . user interface: But isn't that expensive in the entire package ? industrial designer: But that's already possible . marketing: Yeah . project manager: I'm not sure y {vocalsound} I'm not sure it's {disfmarker} if it's expensive , but just take a look at it , because it might be a very good idea . Because if {disfmarker} it's it's uh useful to have it rechargeable , user interface: {gap} project manager: but at the same time , if you don't want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch T_V_ now , you wanna be able to put different batteries in it , use it now and not in half an hour . industrial designer: Yes . Yes . Okay . Uh you could make a device , but I'm not sure how that uh is possible with the costs , that you can put in normal batteries , rechargeable , project manager: I think I have a nice idea . industrial designer: but it {disfmarker} you're {disfmarker} the remote also can act as a recharger . So then you can choose , you have every decision . Know what I mean ? project manager: Not exactly uh . industrial designer: You can uh put in normal Penlites , rechargeable Penlites , but they can also be recharged with the remote , with a wire . marketing: Hmm . Yeah yeah . project manager: I think it's uh it's a pretty good idea to have uh like sort of a {disfmarker} maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_ . Could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , that's g industrial designer: But I think that will cost a lot . project manager: I'm not sure . industrial designer: Uh a normal wire would be better . project manager: A what ? industrial designer: Like a like a P_D_A_ , a hand-held . You can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself , project manager: Well , we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal industrial designer: you don't need basic station . Yes . project manager: or {disfmarker} So you could put that on a T_V_ for example . industrial designer: That is possible , that's true . project manager: It could be very flat , could be very small . marketing: But {disfmarker} Which {disfmarker} project manager: It's a very small {disfmarker} Yeah , I'm drawing it big now , but {disfmarker} So you can put your remote on flat for example . industrial designer: Mm . project manager: And at the backside of remote just just just a little hole marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: for example um you just {vocalsound} put it down , it recharges for example . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: I don't think it's very expensive . user interface: But again , isn't that too expensive ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: 'Cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries , a docking station {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: I'm not sure if it costs a lot , that that's what he r industrial designer: Mm . project manager: That's that you {disfmarker} that's what you buy yourself . industrial designer: Yes . I'm going to try to find that out . I'm not sure if there's information available on this , project manager: It's just an idea , we have to find out if it's possible . industrial designer: but {disfmarker} marketing: But {disfmarker} user interface: And do people actually want that ? To pay extra {disfmarker} they want to pay for rechargeable ? marketing: Yeah , they want to pay for it . project manager: Do they want {disfmarker} but they want a rechargeable one ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: I'm not sure , you should find out if it's {disfmarker} if rechargeable is important . marketing: Th uh there was not a el ask esque {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Hmm . These are uh comfort issues . So I think people will pay {disfmarker} they wanted to pay for comfort . marketing: But {disfmarker} project manager: They want to pay for comfort , industrial designer: Well , this is comfort . project manager: we just assu we we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it , marketing: But f hmm . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: um and {disfmarker} Yeah , we have to {disfmarker} either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station . industrial designer: Hmm . Yeah . Exactly . I think this is a brilliant product . project manager: {vocalsound} I think it would be good actually . industrial designer: I would buy it myself . project manager: I like the beep part {vocalsound} anyway . industrial designer: Uh . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: So um marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: let's go through the {disfmarker} industrial designer: I like the covers . That's a brilliant idea . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Can can we save this or {disfmarker} project manager: Covers is covers is good . industrial designer: I never thought {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , it's {disfmarker} Oh we can save this . Up and saved . We even saved the ant . {gap} Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . So user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: what we have is {disfmarker} you have {disfmarker} I think you have {vocalsound} to do a lot of work on if it's possible for the cost . industrial designer: I hope if I have information about that , project manager: Maybe {disfmarker} yeah , industrial designer: I'm gonna {disfmarker} project manager: or {vocalsound} maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: We are going for twenty five Euros sales price , industrial designer: {gap} marketing: Yeah , okay . project manager: but just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it , because if they're willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers , marketing: Yeah yeah yeah . industrial designer: Mm . {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: uh we just have to see what it looks like . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: I would like to make a decision {gap} . What it costs and what kind of materials that we can uh choose what we want in it project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , if you have some financial information that that'd be nice , industrial designer: and {disfmarker} exactly , I need it . project manager: so . Hmm . {vocalsound} user interface: Could you post some {vocalsound} other essentials of what people want , so that I can work with some buttons , where to put it {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . user interface: You seem to have information on that , I'd like to uh see some of it . industrial designer: Was it not possible to uh send emails around the office ? project manager: No , it wasn't wasn't allo user interface: No , it's not . No . project manager: it was possible , industrial designer: Not {gap} . project manager: not allowed , so . So that's um why I'm not sure that {vocalsound} you're allowed to share documents on the on the draft . marketing: Yeah . My computer crashed , industrial designer: Yeah , okay . marketing: so uh project manager: I don't care . I haven't heard any complaints yet , user interface: Oh , your computer . Okay . marketing: I lost my uh presentation , project manager: so . Um {disfmarker} marketing: but I have the uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: Well , I have your PowerPoint presentation , I can get some inf information out of that . marketing: Yeah , but I Here I have the the s the homepage of uh our internet , user interface: Let's see . project manager: Yeah , the oh , they inc uh marketing: and here is my project manager: they include the new one . {vocalsound} Or just for you . user interface: Oh , where would we {disfmarker} marketing: here is my marketing report , project manager: {vocalsound} Oh marketing: maybe you ca you can look at uh {vocalsound} that project manager: no , I didn't have that . marketing: and {disfmarker} user interface: Where would we want the uh teletext button ? marketing: Ah yeah . user interface: Because we decided that it's n not that important . project manager: All it tells {gap} just {disfmarker} let's make make a new {disfmarker} marketing: And one {disfmarker} user interface: Do we put it somewhere over here ? project manager: tick the new one . {vocalsound} Um other side . Yeah , let's increase it a little because {disfmarker} marketing: And uh wha what people want , I've uh user interface: Or maybe this is something for the next meeting , I can draw out some ideas . project manager: Yeah , draw us up some some designs of of possible {disfmarker} marketing: I have another thing uh {disfmarker} project manager: just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , user interface: Yeah . project manager: so the more {disfmarker} less important {disfmarker} user interface: Well , we have decided {vocalsound} more or less the basic structure . project manager: More or less . user interface: I can put the other buttons in {disfmarker} project manager: Just play a little with this , put l shift a little up or down and we'll see what looks best . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: What uh what did you wanna say ? project manager: Or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share . marketing: Yeah . Um {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Uh what I al already said is the the uh the remote controls are always lost , user interface: Maybe another idea uh . marketing: but it it's also for people , {vocalsound} they want to learn it fast , industrial designer: Mm . Mm . marketing: not uh {disfmarker} they want to {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , so we don't want {gap} we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot . marketing: No industrial designer: Mm . marketing: It's {disfmarker} yeah , it's easy to learn user interface: Yes , but it should cover all the functions , marketing: wi and uh {disfmarker} project manager: Well user interface: so possibly , just an idea that popped in {disfmarker} project manager: what {disfmarker} we had function that what people do , marketing: Um {disfmarker} project manager: so . People change channels , people {vocalsound} {disfmarker} they change the volume and they they change channel , they turn T_V_ off and on , for example . That's the basic fu that's what you do {disfmarker} I'm not sure who present that again , but those are the basic function that people use it for , so those should be very well represented . user interface: Yeah , but we could go a step further , marketing: And {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} user interface: because some T_V_s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus . project manager: That's true , but that's what we stick under the menu button . Everything is {disfmarker} you say in every T_V_ that's configured under the menu . user interface: Yes , but it {disfmarker} Because we're making {disfmarker} industrial designer: But that's the question , is it ? marketing: Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu . project manager: Yeah , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: If it isn't , then we cannot reach it . user interface: We need to adjust to the {vocalsound} technology . project manager: But I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu . industrial designer: I think so too . I think so too . user interface: True . industrial designer: Uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ? If you rule out functions , then uh {disfmarker} and that gets known , then people are not gonna buy it . marketing: {gap} user interface: {vocalsound} No , I thi industrial designer: Then the consumer bond or something says uh you cannot do this and that with it . That's a bad bad com {vocalsound} commercial marketing: If um {disfmarker} project manager: Uh we'll we'll see what we can come up with . industrial designer: for {vocalsound} {disfmarker} okay . marketing: Another thing I want to say is that uh we are looking at the market for the age uh {vocalsound} younger than forty . project manager: Under forty . Yeah ? industrial designer: That's true . marketing: Um on my report , {vocalsound} I didn't uh {vocalsound} ish I didn't show it in my uh presentation , project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: because my computer crashed . project manager: Yeah yeah . marketing: Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . industrial designer: Hmm . Hmm . project manager: The want to pay for {disfmarker} marketing: So project manager: Oh . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Did they really said it like that ? Those two things . marketing: i yeah . Yeah , project manager: Uh shall we ? industrial designer: Do they realise how much that costs ? {vocalsound} marketing: and {disfmarker} industrial designer: That's almost undoable . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Younger , age sixteen and forty five . user interface: Oh , we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then , with an L_C_D_ screen . marketing: {vocalsound} Uh but {disfmarker} project manager: That's all here , here it says {vocalsound} {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} No , that's that's {gap} . Even if i if we have this lost unit , then we cannot do it for that price . project manager: Yeah , age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical . marketing: If if they {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , so we're not focusing on this . Um {disfmarker} All the interest in features , not really the L_C_ {disfmarker} oh here . Would you pay for uh speech recognition in a remote control . Hmm , okay ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's true . marketing: So uh user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: we can project manager: Speech recognition is quite {disfmarker} marketing: We can look at the possibilities for an uh L_C_D_ and uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , just look at the possibilities then , marketing: I dunno . project manager: because if {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: apparently it's what people want , industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: it's supposed to be a luxurious remote , marketing: How much it will cost industrial designer: Uh . marketing: and {disfmarker} project manager: maybe it's not even that expensive . Or find a compromise , maybe just a black and white or {disfmarker} for some extra information on it , on your programmes . industrial designer: Uh I {disfmarker} user interface: Well marketing: Um {disfmarker} user interface: I doubt it , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: But I really need finance information . project manager: Me too . {vocalsound} I mean we all do . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} It will come uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: We all do . {vocalsound} project manager: Right . I think it's something we should put into consideration . Apparently it's what people want , so . We should see if {disfmarker} what it costs , if it's possible . industrial designer: Mm . Uh . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah , we should do a little thing about design , because it looks boring really to me . Even if you put it {disfmarker} even if you put a different cover on it , it looks {disfmarker} still looks boring , marketing: {vocalsound} Different colours maybe . project manager: so . industrial designer: Hmm . And the design , it should differ . marketing: But all {disfmarker} industrial designer: This is Philips , huh ? project manager: I have no clue . industrial designer: Philips has this . project manager: I just drew something what {disfmarker} which would fit into your hand easily . user interface: Well , I had basically {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . Hmm . Uh . user interface: Something like this . To make it kind of futuristic . industrial designer: Mm . Oh , I realise if we make it small , then it needs to be a little thicker , project manager: I think it's a very {disfmarker} industrial designer: because I need to put all the electronics in it . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: If we make it s uh smaller , uh less wide , then we need to m make it a little thicker , project manager: Yeah ? industrial designer: because I have to put all the electronics in it . project manager: Okay . Mm-hmm . Yeah , but you have to j just keep in mind it shouldn't be too heavy . marketing: Okay . project manager: I mean we can stick it in in there , I think . industrial designer: No . project manager: Huh even if {disfmarker} user interface: So project manager: in the worst case we can even {disfmarker} user interface: what kind of {disfmarker} project manager: Could you give me the pen back ? user interface: Yeah , sure . project manager: So let's say that people would want an L_C_D_ thing . Let's take take the basic design again , what we {disfmarker} oh , crap {disfmarker} uh came up with . I'll just make it a little bigger now . So a transmitter here . Anyway . We could {disfmarker} let's say we have an L_C_D_ screen , people want an L_C_D_ screen . So then we should probably put it here . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: It doesn't have to be really big , but just just have to be {disfmarker} has to be there . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: Think it's a good place , people don't {disfmarker} marketing: If you're reading from top to bottom , I think it's better to put it uh at the top . project manager: No ? It's not that uh {disfmarker} it's not the most important function , industrial designer: Me too . marketing: It's j {vocalsound} project manager: it's just an extra thing , industrial designer: Ah project manager: it just {disfmarker} you press the buttons on top , marketing: {vocalsound} Uh . But i if you if you are going to uh put the L_C_D_ on it , {vocalsound} I think it's very important to use it , industrial designer: but {gap} . project manager: because your finger is on top . marketing: uh because it's {vocalsound} {disfmarker} use it uh project manager: How can you use an L_C_D_ screen ? marketing: But nee the function of it . {vocalsound} So you can use it maximum , because uh it's a lot {disfmarker} it costs a lot . project manager: Yeah , but why marketing: So {disfmarker} project manager: I {disfmarker} I'm not sure . user interface: Now it's pretty much tucked away in your hand . project manager: Uh if you t if you press a button , you can see it , industrial designer: Hmm . No . project manager: ri I'm not sure wha I'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like . user interface: I'm {disfmarker} industrial designer: M I personally would prefer it on the top . project manager: You would prefer it n Okay . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So we have three people saying it should be on top . industrial designer: Huh . project manager: Okay , but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else . industrial designer: But it {disfmarker} Hmm . project manager: Anyways . marketing: It's expensive to build it , industrial designer: Mm . marketing: so project manager: Uh this looks a little {disfmarker} user interface: I'm still not convinced of the {disfmarker} marketing: you must use the maximum of it . project manager: About the L_C_D_s thing . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Well if it if it's industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: if it's possible wi if it's not too expensive , we should include it , industrial designer: They want it uh . project manager: because it's it's cool . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} We should just try to make that if it's possible . If it is possible we should really do it , but we need that information . marketing: Huh . Uh . But uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Also keep in mind again , the L_C_D_ screen is very flat , but it needs transistors , resistors , I don't know what more and that needs space . So I have to look if that's possible . marketing: Yeah , I know uh . user interface: So basically industrial designer: But if we {disfmarker} user interface: {disfmarker} can I {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Uh we have green now uh {disfmarker} user interface: what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top . Do we put the volume control and the channel control here , or do we put it on he Would we like to press it in the middle ? project manager: Or maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit {disfmarker} that has it on on on the bottom . marketing: In middle of it . In the middle . project manager: Maybe in a circle for example , like we {disfmarker} like in this example . I think this is not good , but for {disfmarker} we could make circular buttons for example . For up and down , ma make it a circle on it , industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: Yes , but we do agree that we {vocalsound} keep this at the centre , project manager: because it {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: because it's basically the most important function . project manager: I think the channel button should be in the centre . marketing: It's the most import yeah . project manager: Channel button should be st stick together , for example here in this section . Because it's uh {disfmarker} user interface: Well , that would make them quite small . project manager: We're not sure about the size anyway , user interface: So maybe you'd put them here . project manager: just a general design . You can make it as big as you want . For example if you take uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yes , but a big remote control probably not something which people would like . project manager: No , industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: let's see . For example just {disfmarker} industrial designer: If we have a a space issue , we can also lose one battery . It is rechargeable , so we can stick with one instead of two . project manager: Yeah . marketing: {gap} . project manager: I don't think if we if we even use an L_C_D_ screen , we need to , definitely . industrial designer: That might be an option . Yeah , but if we need two batteries and an L_C_D_ screen , that means a lot of space that we need . project manager: Yeah , but we have to see what the si what the size is . industrial designer: But it has to be a little bit heavier . project manager: The L_C_D_ doesn't have to nee doesn't need to be very big . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: {gap} {disfmarker} industrial designer: No , but the things behind it . {gap} space . project manager: Mm let's see . industrial designer: Like a process uh . marketing: Finish meeting now . project manager: Finish meeting now . marketing: It's on your computer . project manager: Okay , we will .
