user interface: Hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Good morning everybody . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Good morning . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Good morning . marketing: Good morning . project manager: So , we are asked to to make uh uh a new remote control for television . And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . So people can {gap} can use it without any any problem . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: I don't know . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh user interface: Mm . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: Uh , not yet , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: but if you want {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this uh d designs . {vocalsound} project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Ah it's Okay . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Or {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Or you can put it in the shared folder . user interface: Yeah , you see the email ? You {gap} email . The v very {disfmarker} no , no the first one . marketing: No , I didn't get it . user interface: It's inside . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} marketing: This one . user interface: No , no . marketing: No . user interface: The third one . Oh , you didn't get anything . marketing: No , {gap} . user interface: It's strange . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Mm . {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} . user interface: I got an email about the dis about the discussion . Yeah . project manager: You get email , {gap} . {vocalsound} user interface: I dunno from who . industrial designer: Yeah , from the account manager . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} From the account manager . You have received the same email , right ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: I think it's for your guys to {vocalsound} how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , I think so . user interface: Yeah , so each of us has a role to do . marketing: Yeah project manager: S marketing: {vocalsound} I think {gap} assign your uh roles . user interface: In each {disfmarker} project manager: For each for each one . user interface: We already have our role . marketing: For each person , yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} 'Kay , we can {disfmarker} project manager: So there are {disfmarker} so we have three {disfmarker} user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: f yeah . We have functional design , conceptual design , and detail design . user interface: Okay , alright . {vocalsound} project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} I think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we {disfmarker} in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: Uh user interface: I'm doing the interface . project manager: You are doing th industrial designer: No , I'm doing the interface . {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} . user interface: Are you using the {disfmarker} you are doing the in {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm {disfmarker} Well , maybe we have {disfmarker} okay so I {gap} industrial design . It was a little confusion about my uh {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Ah {vocalsound} {disfmarker} industrial designer: but it's alright . project manager: Okay , I'll for industrial design . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay . And and you {disfmarker} Norman ? user interface: Mm ? Um working on i . {vocalsound} User interface . {vocalsound} industrial designer: User . project manager: And {disfmarker} And {disfmarker} marketing: Uh , I'm into marketing . project manager: {gap} doing the marketing . marketing: {gap} yeah nothing much in the project . project manager: Nothing related here to the {disfmarker} marketing: Marketing in this design . user interface: Yes . marketing: A design is basically for industrial design and the user interface . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: You see the second mail ? Yeah , it's inside . Go down . Appendix . marketing: Yeah , this is {gap} . user interface: See there's a role for everybody . marketing: Yeah , that's right , user interface: Even for the marketing . marketing: first {gap} . {gap} us user define . project manager: Next {gap} . user interface: But look at your role , your marketing role . marketing: There's a trend watching . project manager: I don't know . user interface: Yeah , that's your role . project manager: I {gap} . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the {disfmarker} project manager: About the design or {disfmarker} Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: So we have to {vocalsound} plan how how it would be developed and uh user interface: Mm . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: how we can make it work {vocalsound} . user interface: Yes . marketing: I mean working remotes we already have . This will be something different from the other remotes {disfmarker} remote controls . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: What we we have to keep in mind the {disfmarker} these characteristics . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I {disfmarker} project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . marketing: Yeah , that's right . project manager: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well I I think that Norman and I would think about um the technical points and um we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: About the {disfmarker} about what ? user interface: Um . {vocalsound} I I'm part of design , perhaps . Uh , what is most important in a {disfmarker} in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ? Uh . project manager: You mean the external {gap} or {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well , you have to make it work . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah of g of course . user interface: {vocalsound} That's alright . industrial designer: {vocalsound} That's the {vocalsound} that's the big thing . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , it should be easy to work with . project manager: Yeah {gap} . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: We can think about an interface with uh well {disfmarker} user interface: Uh . We {disfmarker} maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface . You just tell the television I want {disfmarker} which channel . project manager: You won't {disfmarker} user interface: Or or you can say for example , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I want uh to list all the programme tonight . Y you know {gap} , instead of {gap} uh remote control it's doing the {disfmarker} some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . Just say maybe I just want to press {disfmarker} I wanna have a button for all the movies tonight . Or a button for all the magazines , all the information {disfmarker} documentary tonight . And then you list a few , and I will choose from the list . So instead of pressing the channel number , I am choosing the programmes directly . Yeah , that's one way of uh making it useful . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because {disfmarker} no , project manager: S {vocalsound} user interface: it's not very {disfmarker} a lot . Th this information exists . For example you can get um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: Like s uh you you you say we can use speech . user interface: You can use uh {disfmarker} well for example {disfmarker} anything . {vocalsound} The {vocalsound} the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but uh and it's more natural . Yeah . industrial designer: I {disfmarker} I think if you want t to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh w uh I dunno marketing: I'm a {disfmarker} okay . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: I mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with {gap} trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . Yes , possible . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . user interface: Yeah . But {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: And I could talk to the T_V_ {disfmarker} television itself . project manager: Except if if you are far from the T_V_ . marketing: I need not have an {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: I mean we have some {gap} or something , different technology but {disfmarker} project manager: This is {vocalsound} it's {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that um {vocalsound} there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: On the content . marketing: Mm-hmm , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: So it's more powerful . Yeah . industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to {disfmarker} user interface: No . No , because you see now all the T_V_ programmes are available on the webs . They they are {disfmarker} they are {disfmarker} they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . We don't care . We just say that this are some content . We just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes . Some of the websites they already provide this service , industrial designer: Yeah yeah . user interface: so we can just use the service available . Download it uh to the {disfmarker} to this remote control . project manager: Mm . user interface: And then there's {disfmarker} there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . The most there are only seven buttons . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so {vocalsound} you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . project manager: Yeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons . user interface: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to uh navigate uh through the {disfmarker} Well channel programme or contents or {disfmarker} in an easy way , so {disfmarker} project manager: This is {gap} good idea . user interface: Yeah . Ah , yes . So {gap} . Yeah . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea {vocalsound} . Okay . industrial designer: and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary {vocalsound} . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Because all the T_V_ uh the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . Yeah . {vocalsound} Alright . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . So {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to {disfmarker} user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you {disfmarker} so , can we industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . Okay . marketing: So , I mean , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark uh {vocalsound} some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . user interface: Yeah . project manager: S user interface: Yeah . marketing: The lighting in the room changes . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , but we are designing just remote control . project manager: You {disfmarker} it {gap} . marketing: I mean , we have a option in the remote control . If we want to have that option , you press that button in the remote . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Oh right so {disfmarker} user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . If if you you you can if you want you can use th the {gap} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Please , Norman , draw uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Go on , draw something {gap} . {vocalsound} Mm . marketing: Oh , I'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel . user interface: Where is it ? marketing: The lapel . project manager: Or before the before the the design that says {gap} . user interface: Ah , okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Where where is it ? Here . marketing: Yeah , that one . project manager: Norman . marketing: Just plug it . user interface: Mm . marketing: Yeah , that's right . project manager: Be before before writing you can uh sit and that says {gap} what we what we said user interface: Mm . project manager: then after that you can you can use the {gap} . Yeah . user interface: Okay , alright . So so the most functional des mm the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . Right ? We agree on that , right ? industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Okay . user interface: Uh , uh first one is to uh {vocalsound} buttons i or it could be anything with {gap} buttons . Uh to choose uh content s or channels . project manager: Yeah . user interface: So we have both . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . industrial designer: it's a good idea . user interface: Choose by contents or by channels . And then what did we say just now ? Other than this . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: And uh we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents . user interface: Okay , so technically how {disfmarker} the problems that {disfmarker} how to do it is to {disfmarker} how to get the content . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: Challenge . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . Content . Okay , so these we have to work it out . So this one of the problem . And uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} industrial designer: I think that's the {gap} the things to do user interface: The main thing . industrial designer: and uh to uh reflect about it user interface: Okay . Alright . Alright , okay . industrial designer: and uh discuss it in the next meeting . user interface: So we are {disfmarker} we'll discuss it {disfmarker} we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get uh the funct this is the functional designer {gap} ? That's the first aspect . Right . We will {gap} get information and then we'll come back in . {gap} . industrial designer: Okay . Thank you everybody . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , we'll come . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects . user interface: Alright . Alright , okay . industrial designer: Okay . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . Well thank you all {gap} . {vocalsound} user interface: Thank you , mis {vocalsound}
