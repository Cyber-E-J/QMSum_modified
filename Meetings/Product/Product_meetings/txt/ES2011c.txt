project manager: Hi everyone , hope you had a nice lunch . Um {vocalsound} . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Alright we're moving on to conceptual design . user interface: {vocalsound} 'Scuse me . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Bless you . project manager: Um , I'll just review what we did in our last meeting . Um , {vocalsound} under marketing we targeted our audience , and {disfmarker} Um , yeah . That was {vocalsound} generally {vocalsound} {disfmarker} how helpful that was . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Um , then we considered some design options with how it should look , um , we discussed an iPod-like button system which , uh , we haven't concluded but we're {disfmarker} Right , um {disfmarker} So , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what {disfmarker} where you've come from our last time . Does everyone have presentations ? industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Yes . user interface: Yes . project manager: Would anybody like to go first ? industrial designer: Sure . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: So I've been looking at the components design . Um . Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel . The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . So we have some material options . Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case . project manager: And why not wood ? industrial designer: And , project manager: And why not wood ? {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} industrial designer: hmm ? {vocalsound} Uh , well we can use wood . {vocalsound} I don't know why we'd want to . Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . I don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive . So that's what I've got on design . project manager: 'S good . marketing: Um , can I do next ? 'Cause I have to say something about the material project manager: Hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . marketing: which is quite shocking . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Ha . Mm . Right , um , I have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel . Um . Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . And th last thing is the easy to use um factor . Um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use . Um , our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the {vocalsound} is the current trend project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . Um . For fashion , we go for fashion . project manager: Mm . marketing: The fashion in electronics . So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . And also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer . As to the material should be limited to {disfmarker} I don't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go . Um . I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables , industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: but that's just a personal opinion . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: I think project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Uh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ? project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Um , and finally again with the spongy . It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find {disfmarker} come up with a solution that's better than mine . Um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be um , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Thank you for your attention . user interface: So . project manager: I think it's the next {disfmarker} it's the blue one , yeah . user interface: Oh , uh , there we go . {vocalsound} Uh . Okay . Um . Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} I actually wasn't aware of the {vocalsound} new trends in electronics project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: and and uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: Neither was I . Well it's a trend in fashion , in clothing and um {vocalsound} fabrics . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: So so okay , let me get this right . Okay , uh {disfmarker} Okay , alright anyway . Um {vocalsound} here we go . Conceptual User Interface . Trying {disfmarker} we're gonna try to talk about , um {vocalsound} what kind of uh {disfmarker} how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: And , um , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system . {vocalsound} Uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . Um , kind of {disfmarker} I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ? project manager: Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time . user interface: 'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this {disfmarker} it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um {vocalsound} the wheel project manager: You need a screen for it ? user interface: you {disfmarker} it seems like you would need a screen . industrial designer: You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever . With T_V_ channels it's , you know , one two three . So {disfmarker} user interface: But like if you think about it {disfmarker} yeah but if {disfmarker} so is it just {disfmarker} okay . So , b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that , aren't you ? project manager: We're , um , we're actually not having D_V_D_ , user interface: Are we {disfmarker} project manager: that was one of th I I was {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Okay . project manager: sorry , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: I I meant to update you on that . Um . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Alright . Okay . marketing: But the screen can come up on the telly , the {disfmarker} she said . user interface: Okay . Okay . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: That correct ? user interface: So anyway if {disfmarker} well we just {disfmarker} we need to {disfmarker} Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I was thinking {disfmarker} okay . So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? And you're just gonna {disfmarker} I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a {disfmarker} right . marketing: Graphical interface ? user interface: Yeah like you're g marketing: Uh on the {disfmarker} you can have it on the telly though . project manager: Yeah . user interface: yeah like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can {disfmarker} okay we're not choosing that , I guess . But like choose channel control , like if you wa Because people aren't gonna be able to have like , um , you know , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine . project manager: Yeah . user interface: So that {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} people seems to be {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} project manager: You've {disfmarker} Yeah , I know what you're saying , you have to {disfmarker} user interface: You know . But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels . So um {vocalsound} I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because {disfmarker} So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if {disfmarker} or or {disfmarker} then again if you just {disfmarker} I guess {disfmarker} I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on . marketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , yeah . project manager: But but imagine someone with s industrial designer: My flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the T_V_ . user interface: I oh yeah ? project manager: But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels . Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: 'Cause you'll have to like {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: They have to r wheel really fast . user interface: but you can quickly s you can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels , user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah . industrial designer: at least on theirs . user interface: Yeah if you do , it w so it would have to be {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , and um {disfmarker} So you're either {disfmarker} you're {disfmarker} you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different project manager: Yeah . user interface: uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels . Like if you just wanted to go to like {disfmarker} from five to six you could tap or someth project manager: Right . user interface: And then there's also the concern about you know um {vocalsound} how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , or if you want to um {vocalsound} you know switch around , I don't know , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that , project manager: Yeah I mean with that many options , you'd {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} I'd think that the screen would be better , user interface: like {disfmarker} project manager: because you could have that menu option , sort of {disfmarker} user interface: I would think so too , like {disfmarker} So I mean {disfmarker} and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , because {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . user interface: but then again it would {disfmarker} it does make kind of {disfmarker} if the screen's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's kind of {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: It's more expensive according to the design people . user interface: m yeah . project manager: Uh . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , that's the only thing though . industrial designer: You have to get a {disfmarker} an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal . user interface: Yeah . So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing , um {disfmarker} project manager: Mm . user interface: {vocalsound} You can get to {disfmarker} you know , you can {disfmarker} Like maybe it'll be that central button that , like , then you hit that and then you can {disfmarker} it brings up like the menu on the T_V_ marketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yeah . user interface: and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: So the T_V_ is the screen , that {disfmarker} yeah user interface: yeah , yeah . project manager: So it would have all these different options of changing user interface: Yeah . But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up . project manager: to {disfmarker} marketing: Look it even has settings . project manager: Okay . user interface: Hmm ? marketing: On the {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} you can just take theirs and just {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , well we don't want the screen I guess , project manager: Yeah . user interface: but um {disfmarker} 'cause that just {disfmarker} it does seem like , it {disfmarker} that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but {disfmarker} I dunno , and then {disfmarker} so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: So {disfmarker} project manager: Um , right . What if {disfmarker} I mean , if you're thinking of the design of it now , like the a you know , physical attributes , user interface: Yeah . project manager: um , and you just have this , it's like just a long silver thing , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: or whatever we're thinking . I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ? Or {disfmarker} user interface: It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the T_V_ . project manager: Yeah . So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . I mean {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . Yeah definitely . project manager: okay . user interface: Like , I think we're looking at something that could be , like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing . project manager: Yeah . user interface: I mean it it needs to be easy to {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah but should be comfortable . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . user interface: I mean how do how do {disfmarker} I'm not really {disfmarker} Like when I use an iPod , I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it . So {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb , yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Or your thumb or something . So {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah I use it like that . industrial designer: W when we had the wheely remote control , we {disfmarker} it was on the top I think , if you held it like that . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: But , were there buttons on there as well ? user interface: Yeah , so {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do . project manager: Mm . Yeah . industrial designer: So we just used the top part . user interface: Mm yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , so {disfmarker} but I mean I think it could be pretty small . marketing: Uh . user interface: Like , I d I mean , you you want it to be large enough that you can {disfmarker} project manager: What if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ? Like you {disfmarker} so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that ? So the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it . user interface: But can't you just get {disfmarker} project manager: Do {disfmarker} do you know what I'm talking about though ? Like , uh , yeah just something {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of {disfmarker} user interface: K marketing: Well you can have it on the settings , project manager: Yeah , that you can flip over , yeah , yeah . marketing: no ? user interface: Yeah , But , I mean , do you need that ? If if you can get to , you know {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the T_V_ screen . project manager: Yeah I mean I guess that's the thing industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: is is {disfmarker} if w I {disfmarker} user interface: That keeps it project manager: if we can do this , that'd probably be {disfmarker} user interface: really {disfmarker} Yeah . Uh you wouldn't {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I just don't think you would even need it . project manager: Yeah , yeah . user interface: So {disfmarker} project manager: So I guess we have to look into the , um , like , the programming , how this {disfmarker} how they actually programme these things , and if that's {disfmarker} user interface: Mean {disfmarker} industrial designer: Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_ ? project manager: yeah . I mean it {disfmarker} would y would {disfmarker} that would be {disfmarker} industrial designer: I don't know . user interface: I mean you can do it , marketing: They already do it . industrial designer: I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_ , not inside the remote . user interface: you {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} it doesn't seem that hard . I mean I've never bought a remote . industrial designer: I'm not sure . user interface: It sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television , industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well they usually are . user interface: which is a little {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well {disfmarker} user interface: My {disfmarker} I've never bought just a remote , like , so I don't I don't really know . marketing: No . project manager: Huh . user interface: But um {disfmarker} industrial designer: I guess that's right . It always comes with the T_V_ . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: So , um {disfmarker} but I mean it's {disfmarker} I've never had a hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know . And I don't think that should uh that should be too hard . industrial designer: Yeah , it {disfmarker} most of the ones we've had have had the menu button , 'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something . 'Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . Well so {disfmarker} So , do we need {disfmarker} I dunno . Well I guess we have to you know think about {disfmarker} But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yeah . Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: That's what it does anyway . marketing: But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you {disfmarker} like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand , user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: you don't know they mean , yeah , it's like {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: and I never get it . project manager: yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Never ever . user interface: So , but {disfmarker} marketing: So {disfmarker} user interface: oh , you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen ? marketing: Well on the telly . industrial designer: Or on the T_V_ too . user interface: On the telly , okay , yeah . So yeah I think , I mean , I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those {disfmarker} like okay now I hit this {disfmarker} you know , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date . project manager: Mm . And it is technologically innovative in a way , marketing: Mm . project manager: so that fits with the {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . I guess . And it is trendy , the iPods are {vocalsound} really hot right now , so {disfmarker} project manager: B Yeah . marketing: Did you did you get that pc picture on {disfmarker} did they provide you with that picture on the web ? user interface: Um , yeah , by web research , yeah , so {disfmarker} marketing: That's quite interesting . What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I'm dreading ? {vocalsound} project manager: Oh god . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Oh , I was gonna say . user interface: Oh . industrial designer: You said uh people want spongy . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Um , one of your {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's {gap} in like those stress ball things . So , that would be spongy . user interface: Oh , okay , that would be cool . project manager: Ah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Mm . {vocalsound} marketing: Just nice feel , but I hate spongy . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , c that's e that would be kind of {disfmarker} oh , you know , usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type , you know , thing . project manager: Yeah . I mean definitely the area round it . user interface: But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: so you're like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah I think it could work . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Or what if we integrated the {vocalsound} the uh the f what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: we somehow made it tactilely fash you know , we c tapped into that , so like it feels like industrial designer: {vocalsound} Don't think I'd want it to feel like a banana . user interface: a vegetable . {vocalsound} marketing: Well it could be like mobiles that just {disfmarker} you just put a cover . project manager: An orange . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: If it's a small thing , you c instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana , industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: which frankly I'm not particularly fond of , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: um you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: You know you had {disfmarker} there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles . industrial designer: You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . You could name it after fruits and vegetables , or {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: And it could {disfmarker} the colour can fit your sitting room , industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry , and then if you have a green one you can have {disfmarker} well I don't know . Um . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . project manager: So what if {disfmarker} what user interface: So I think {disfmarker} project manager: {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} user interface: yeah , colours . project manager: I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking . If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand , so like what you're feeling is comfortable , and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Is that kind of {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: I {disfmarker} 'cause I I'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Um {disfmarker} user interface: Unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: I do I dunno . Um {disfmarker} project manager: I mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just {disfmarker} the feedback we've just got about the {disfmarker} marketing: Maybe a ball . project manager: A ball ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Know , a squashy ball . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} A relaxing squashy ball . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That you can p user interface: That's in the shape of a fruit , like a {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: well I {disfmarker} see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit project manager: Yeah . marketing: and I'm thinking how do you change the hard {disfmarker} would you put a um sticker sort of ? Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , like a {disfmarker} project manager: This is just {disfmarker} Okay . Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit . Squashy . marketing: Oh , okay , yeah . Yeah I was thinking of getting a cover for {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: That {disfmarker} see I was thinking this s marketing: Which is cheaper . project manager: sorry {disfmarker} marketing: Well I don't know if it's cheaper actually . project manager: I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing . industrial designer: Oh . Mm . user interface: Yeah . project manager: And like this {disfmarker} you could have like you could have like cherries and {vocalsound} things around there . user interface: Oh I like that shape . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Um but {disfmarker} industrial designer: I was thinking sort of a single ball shape . project manager: I was thinking if it was like this {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} . industrial designer: So you're holding a squishy ball project manager: 'cause the way you were describing the the iPod and the thi the roll thingy {disfmarker} industrial designer: and then it has a {disfmarker} Mm-hmm . user interface: It's like it has to be s project manager: It's almost like your thumb is farther up , user interface: yeah {vocalsound} . project manager: so if if you could squish it lower then {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah I guess so . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . So it wouldn't be very big in either {disfmarker} like how big ? This big , and then you just do that , I suppose . project manager: Yeah , I know what you meant , yeah . user interface: What if , yeah , what if the squishy , oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , and you can {disfmarker} so so maybe one you know {disfmarker} you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: and you could get {disfmarker} you could have your choice , you know ? marketing: Well just a li I can't des like condom thingy , like a a cover . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: But {disfmarker} well the question is , which one's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that , project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that , user interface: Yeah , yeah . project manager: Mm . marketing: and for now we can do two prototypes maybe and then hi try and ask users what the best is , user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: and {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay . marketing: No . user interface: Oh . marketing: Um . That's nicer . I think it's nicer to have a drawing 'cause it's neater . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Hmm . Well that's not very neat , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: Um . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . I mean I think uh {disfmarker} and I think the handhe I think the handheld part is definitely {disfmarker} So you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part . marketing: If it's a bit like those juggling balls , you can change shape according to your {disfmarker} to the way you hold it . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah you could squish it . marketing: If it's got sand in it maybe , or something , you {disfmarker} it it just moulds to your hand . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . So where are the fruit and vegetables now ? project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front , or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath . user interface: Fruits and veg . marketing: We we don't know . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . marketing: And the rest is the company {disfmarker} the company colour's silver ? project manager: It was , yeah , silver and yellow . It l it looks like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: We could promote the banana one . marketing: Okay . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Like {disfmarker} mm . project manager: I mean that's another question , where are we gonna {disfmarker} we we should have the logo somewhere on it . user interface: Mm . marketing: Mm-hmm . Should also fit the batteries , which we haven't {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case . user interface: Oh yeah . project manager: Yeah , th and that would {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: Especially if you're switching out the squishy part . Then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah , I think , um it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit . The part that you , yeah , can change into the different , you know , trendy vegetables and fruits . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: But uh it {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well I dunno . You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand . Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again . user interface: Yeah . marketing: No but it does it automatically . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Does it automatically ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: I don't know . project manager: I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} But if someone {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . project manager: components concept . Question mark . Energy . Question mark . industrial designer: That was me . project manager: Was that you ? industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Okay . Oh right right . Yeah . Um , so what d but what do we know about energy ? I mean we're gonna use batteries right ? And {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo , project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: which is something I don't know what it is . Something to do with torches . marketing: Oh , a dynamo is {disfmarker} ah , {vocalsound} it's a bicycle . It's a bicycle mechanism . It's the en it's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy . industrial designer: Oh okay . Yeah , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So I sort of picked battery . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: It's quite sweet . industrial designer: We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways . project manager: I think batteries sound good . industrial designer: It {vocalsound} it seems a little weird for a living room anyways . project manager: What does everyone else think ? {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} The dynamo would be interesting {vocalsound} . marketing: No . But dynamo {disfmarker} the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it {vocalsound} creates energy on its own . project manager: What about Kryptonite ? {vocalsound} user interface: Oh . marketing: Which is quite cool . So if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying . But we need to find cost . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Don't know the cost . industrial designer: Didn't have enough data to actually {disfmarker} marketing: Does anyone have costs on the on the web ? industrial designer: All it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things . It didn't give me any actual cost . marketing: Okay . Right . user interface: Hmm . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . So I don't think it's that much of a problem . Like the chip is probably the most expensive part . project manager: What does chip on print mean ? industrial designer: Um , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh-huh . industrial designer: calculators too I think . Um , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: But it's not like a computer , you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it's like stamped onto the chip . project manager: Right . So , chip on print is just {disfmarker} means like that they're mass-produced . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay . And case ? Uh I guess that's what we've been talking about , industrial designer: Case is what we were discussing yeah . project manager: yeah . Casing . Yeah . {gap} thinking of like syntactic case and thi industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: um {vocalsound} let's see . Is there anything else we need to user interface: Hmm . project manager: talk about ? Oh when we move on , you two are going to be playing with play-dough . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Um , and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design . And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation . So you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach . marketing: Oh , thank you . {vocalsound} project manager: Mm . user interface: Cool . project manager: See you soon . Does it matter that I end early ? marketing: I {disfmarker} it's strange because {disfmarker} project manager: How how early is it ? I didn't get a pop-up thing that said {disfmarker}
