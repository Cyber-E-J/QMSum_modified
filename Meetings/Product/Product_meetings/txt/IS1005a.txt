industrial designer: Now what . project manager: 'Kay , hello everybody . Uh , I guess you all know what is it about , you all received the email , I guess . Uh , we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control . So I'm going to be the project manager of this uh project . And uh so I'm {disfmarker} present myself . I'm Fabien Cardinaux and uh I I guess you can present yourself . So I dunno , you can starts . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay , so my name is Petre {gap} . You can call me Petre {gap} , or Peter if you like . I don't care {gap} . project manager: Okay . marketing: Uh my name's Bob Mor . project manager: And you are ? In the project ? industrial designer: Uh , in the project I'm supposed to be the technic . marketing: Oh , sorry . project manager: {gap} marketing: 'Kay . So my name's Bob Morris . I'm the Marketing Expert for this project . industrial designer: Bob , marketing: Bob yeah . industrial designer: okay . user interface: My name is Hamed Getabdar , and uh I'm going to be Interface Designer in this project . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: So , uh , so today we are doing a short meeting to present the project , so um We are gooding we are going to present the tool we are {vocalsound} we are going to use during all this project . We are talking about the project plan , and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on , and , yeah . So we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting . Um . So what is the goal of this project ? Is to design a new remote control . So it should be , of course , new and original , and um it should be trendy , and user friendly . That mean it's a very challenging project , and uh uh . So w it's {disfmarker} we will try to do our best , and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy . So , um {disfmarker} So what's uh what are we going to do during this all this project ? So it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way . Um . Yeah and everything is {disfmarker} will be like this . Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all {disfmarker} during all this project . So we can try to use uh the whiteboard here . So {gap} uh . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it . Mm . Uh {vocalsound} . So uh {disfmarker} {gap} So I will ask you all to do the same . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Just to get used to the whiteboard . industrial designer: So probably I would try to try to draw the animal . Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal ? project manager: Yeah , yeah , you can draw the picture , of course {vocalsound} . industrial designer: I I th I think I should . marketing: Yeah go ahead . industrial designer: Okay , so . Um {vocalsound} . Okay , American , um . Um . I would use the bird . So I tried to sketch it out . I had to first uh write it down because I am not absolutely sure if I can draw it , but ah . Can you recognise it {vocalsound} as a bird ? project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay {vocalsound} it's your turn to {disfmarker} marketing: Okay , okay . {vocalsound} So I think my favourite animal would be a c a cat . project manager: Oh . marketing: That's its head . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Um I probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and uh playful . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {gap} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . user interface: I dunno if I should go with this {gap} {vocalsound} . industrial designer: Oh it's okay . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Thanks . {vocalsound} user interface: If it is enough line . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Maybe put it up user interface: {vocalsound} I'm sorry . {vocalsound} marketing: {disfmarker} Put it a Maybe put it on the desk or something . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I should get used to the tool , so . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Oh just wait {gap} a little bit . C could we put it here , to make it as straight as possible ? user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Ah probably not . user interface: {vocalsound} They should be remote . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay , it {disfmarker} it works like this . marketing: Uh , that's better . user interface: Okay , thanks . marketing: Your lapel microphone's fallen off . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Are you left-handed ? user interface: No . industrial designer: Oh , pity {vocalsound} . user interface: Okay . Should I clean ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Okay , I think like horses uh because they are strong and beautiful , so if I want to write it here , I think I can . {vocalsound} Oh {vocalsound} . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Never mind . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Ah , it's maybe better if you leave it . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . Maybe we should just continue . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , don't worry about it . {vocalsound} user interface: {gap} project manager: {gap} , no worry . marketing: No . industrial designer: {gap} user interface: Okay . industrial designer: You won't draw them , or ? project manager: You can draw it , if you want . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: I dunno if I can . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Just try . I would like to see how it looks like . user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} It may be like a cow or I dunno , whatever . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} I'm not good very good in drawing . Okay , so this is very {vocalsound} {disfmarker} It's a bird , I think . I dunno what is it . {vocalsound} industrial designer: No , I think it's clear . user interface: {vocalsound} Four . Okay . Mm-hmm . Mm . Yeah . I'm shameful {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Oh that's good , it's good . industrial designer: It's okay . It's in it's indeed beautiful . project manager: Good . marketing: Yeah , and strong . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Bob . Have to remember it . Bob . project manager: So good um {disfmarker} So , let's talk about money . Uh we are going to to sell {disfmarker} we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro . And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro . And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world . So {gap} n not only for Switzerland , but for the world . Uh . So , um . The {disfmarker} We expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty Euro . industrial designer: Per unit , I guess . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , of course . industrial designer: Y oh okay . project manager: Um , so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ? So , if you have some experience , good or bad , with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea . Anything . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Well , from experience , um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very {disfmarker} they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small , and it's been very hard to to to use , because there's so many buttons , and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what , and the buttons are very small and very hard to press . Um and and normally you only every use , you know , on a T_V_ remote you only ever use , mostly , you know , f four or f six buttons . Um . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: Oh . marketing: So it's frustrated me in the past , th that . industrial designer: Okay , I have also some points uh . Maybe two points . Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light {vocalsound} , so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so . So something like this . And the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh {disfmarker} there are two buttons for volume control . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like . marketing: Ah , okay . Okay . industrial designer: You know , some slider or {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Not just two discrete buttons for volume , user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Okay , n {vocalsound} industrial designer: but something which {disfmarker} project manager: Mm-hmm . Yeah . marketing: Is that because the {disfmarker} of the discrete volume levels , or is that industrial designer: Yeah , but I can reach {disfmarker} In uh one second I can mute it down , or or make a high volume . project manager: {gap} Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could {gap} {disfmarker} the the volume can go up very quickly marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Ah , n . project manager: and it can {disfmarker} industrial designer: If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream {gap} . project manager: Yeah , also if y when you take the the remote control , for example on the table , you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud , and industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , f It depends what what you feel about that . project manager: you have a heart attack {vocalsound} . Okay . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards , but if {gap} you have some more notes on that . project manager: Yeah so you can {disfmarker} user interface: Uh I {disfmarker} Yeah , project manager: Do you have something ? user interface: just a simple experience . I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves , because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune {gap} . project manager: Yeah , that's true . Yeah without obstacles and {gap} . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Okay . Let's continue . industrial designer: Um . project manager: I have a meeting in five minutes , so maybe we should hurry . marketing: Okay . project manager: Um . So we will close uh this meeting . industrial designer: Okay , just a second . {gap} project manager: So we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Um . Uh . The {disfmarker} So I will ask you to do some work . Uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control , start to to have new idea and industrial designer: Which i which is Hamed , {gap} ? project manager: read about {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Mm . marketing: He's the Industrial Designer ? No , you're the Industrial Designer . industrial designer: Uh I am the Technical Designer , user interface: Yeah . project manager: Oh . industrial designer: I dunno which one , uh v . marketing: Yeah , project manager: Industry and {disfmarker} Oh . marketing: I think that's the first . I_D_ . Industrial Designer . user interface: Uh-huh . marketing: And the second one is the User Interface Designer . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: User Interf Okay . marketing: And then last one's marketing , which is me . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay , so I'm the first one . project manager: So , um {disfmarker} marketing: {gap} project manager: For the User Interface Designer , which is Hamed um , user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: uh , you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control . industrial designer: I see . user interface: Okay . project manager: And for the Marketing uh Manager , I dunno , okay , which is Bob , uh you are going to try to to find the user requirements f uh for the remote control . Um , you will receive by email uh the specific instructions and uh by your personal coach . industrial designer: {gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} Sign . project manager: Yep finished . So I see you in thirty minutes . marketing: Great , okay . project manager: {gap} industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Okay , thanks . marketing: Thanks guys . Bye . user interface: Bye . project manager: Thank you . industrial designer: {gap} Uh . {gap}
