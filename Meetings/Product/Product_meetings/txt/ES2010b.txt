project manager: Okay . Um welcome to our second meeting . This is the functional design meeting . And I hope you all had a good individual working time . Okay , let's get started . Okay , here's the agenda for the meeting . After the opening um I am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . And we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . Then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . Um gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control . And then we're gonna close up the meeting . And we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes . {gap} Okay . First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting . First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of {disfmarker} 'Kay I'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: 'Kay . Oh , well let's go ahead and , user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} back , previous . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: So what I wanna do right now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did . Who would like to start us off ? 'Kay . user interface: I don't mind going first . project manager: Okay . Um do you have a PowerPoint or no ? user interface: Yeah , it's in the {disfmarker} should be in the m Project . project manager: Okay . marketing: Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or {disfmarker} user interface: You know you could you could do it yourself actually . project manager: Oh . industrial designer: Did you send it ? project manager: Save it in the project documents . user interface: Put it in Project Documents , project manager: Okay . user interface: yeah . project manager: Mm-mm-mm . This one ? user interface: Sure . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . Great . user interface: Okay . Um well , the function {vocalsound} of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera . Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , the channel going up and down , volume going up and down , and then mute , a mute function . And then functions for V_H_S_ , D_V_D_ , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . And enter would be for like , you know , the menus . {vocalsound} And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ , whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus . project manager: {gap} user interface: And we can decide if that's what we want , {gap} , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example . project manager: Okay . Okay . user interface: These are two examples . Um and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: and I don't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , um slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is {disfmarker} fast-forward is also like next on a menu . So you have functions that are d uh duplicating . project manager: Right . user interface: And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . So that gives you two different kinds , a more complex and more simple version . Okay . project manager: Ready . user interface: And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? And what functions it needs to complete . Uh , what are needed to complete insulation process , 'cause , you know , that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place . project manager: {gap} user interface: So that's it . project manager: Alright . Very good presentation . Thank you . You speak with such authority on the matter . user interface: Mm . Left . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . Who would like to um follow that one up ? Now , that we've discussed {disfmarker} marketing: I can go . project manager: Okay . Do you want me to run it or you wanna {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , you should run it . project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Functional requirements . marketing: {vocalsound} Mm yes . project manager: 'Kay . Alright . Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements . marketing: Yes , okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , and we found that the {vocalsound} users are not typically happy with current remote controls . Seventy five percent think they're ugly . Eighty percent want {disfmarker} they've {disfmarker} are willing to spend more , which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier , and basically w we just need something that really I mean there's some other points up there , but they {disfmarker} it needs to be snazzy and it {disfmarker} but yet simple . user interface: {gap} Wait . marketing: So that's really what we need to do . And we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high-tech looking . So {disfmarker} user interface: And that meaning what ? marketing: Like {disfmarker} They like I guess use the buttons a lot . user interface: Okay . marketing: Yeah . user interface: {gap} marketing: I don't know . It's from my uh research . project manager: Okay , what do you m user interface: Right . marketing: My team wasn't very clear . project manager: Oh , I'm sorry . user interface: Only use ten percent of the buttons . project manager: What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons . marketing: {vocalsound} That's okay . I I think it's like the engineering versus user , project manager: Okay . marketing: whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex project manager: Oh , right . marketing: and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really . project manager: The buttons . Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . Okay . industrial designer: We only use ten per cent of our brains . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: Good point . project manager: It works . marketing: It's a necessary evil . industrial designer: {vocalsound} yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Ready for the next slide ? marketing: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} And so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time , project manager: Hmm . marketing: much like any small appliance like a cellphone , user interface: Lost . marketing: and they {disfmarker} we need something simple , because most people , well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , and we don't want to go {disfmarker} we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote , user interface: S marketing: but I mean they do need to be able to identify it , and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is . project manager: It's okay . It's very important . {vocalsound} marketing: Yes , it is important for the remote control world . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Wait , is that like your {disfmarker} ergonomics like your hand movements or something ? marketing: Sh project manager: Could be , yeah . marketing: Uh possibly . industrial designer: Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ? user interface: Like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Oh . marketing: Uh yeah , that's what my web site said , I user interface: Channel , volume , power . project manager: I think that's a pretty good guess though . marketing: don't know . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , I would assume so . user interface: It's like if you're holding it {disfmarker} marketing: I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts . project manager: Yeah . It's okay . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} But also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones . project manager: Okay . Next slide ? marketing: Yes . And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple . So saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly . project manager: User-friendly . marketing: Where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is . Um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in {disfmarker} like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player , a TiVo , what what exactly are we using it for , as well as the age range . So we need a hip , but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product . user interface: {gap} marketing: And also we found {disfmarker} our team found that speech recognition is {disfmarker} it's like an up-and-coming thing they really {disfmarker} consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it . project manager: And so just to {disfmarker} just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ? marketing: I guess so , yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . user interface: {gap} to just say , where are you , and thing beeps , you know . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Oh , that'd be lovely . marketing: Yeah , I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme . user interface: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Didn't they {disfmarker} um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would {disfmarker} the remote would beep so if you have lost it {disfmarker} user interface: It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do . project manager: Mm . Oh , yeah , that's true . user interface: You know like go to the base . project manager: We could definitely include that if we wanted to . user interface: Yeah . project manager: If it's within our price . Okay . Are we ready for our last presentation , Amber ? industrial designer: Yeah , I'm just trying to move it . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: 'Kay . I think it should be there , working design . user interface: Working design . project manager: There we go . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: 'Kay . industrial designer: 'Kay . Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating . project manager: Oh my bad . {vocalsound} marketing: Oh that's fine . industrial designer: Uh okay , so method method of our design , I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this . user interface: Help me . industrial designer: We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip . Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: What exactly is a smart chip ? industrial designer: Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions . user interface: Well , how much extra would the additional chip be ? Is that gonna push us over our production costs ? industrial designer: I wouldn't think so , 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company . And they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Okay . Ready ? industrial designer: Um yep , nothing here . project manager: That's okay . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Um power source , I figured , batteries , 'cause they're easily available . Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s , sometimes three . Uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself . user interface: {gap} industrial designer: Um a large on-off button , {vocalsound} demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , so a large on-off button would probably be good . user interface: {vocalsound} {gap} project manager: Hmm . industrial designer: Selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system . Um smart chip that perverts {disfmarker} uh that permits , sorry , universal application again , something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , and that's kinda it . project manager: {gap} industrial designer: Uh this is my fifty second design . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Power source over here . We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch . Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness , um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device . Um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to . marketing: So what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ? industrial designer: This is just like a rough schematic . project manager: So this would be the front ? industrial designer: So this is the internal workings . project manager: So the red would be the front of the remote though , right ? marketing: Oh okay . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah , that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_ , but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance . project manager: The l {vocalsound} the light up kind of {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , so you don't have to stare at that infra-red , marketing: Like that we know the battery's working . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: 'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , okay , when I push this button , is it working ? project manager: Hmm . It'd probably be lighting up the key too , marketing: Okay . industrial designer: We can skip that whole thing . project manager: right ? industrial designer: Yep . project manager: 'Kay . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: So you can put it in the dark . {vocalsound} project manager: The buttons . marketing: Yeah , and that's good . project manager: Okay . marketing: We should make it glow in the dark . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , definitely . 'Kay nex R Ready ? industrial designer: Yeah , that's it . project manager: 'Kay , any p 'Kay ? user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Mm 'kay . project manager: Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though , you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think . Anything else ? industrial designer: I think that that's a good idea , because you know that's one of the most important buttons . user interface: Just {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . user interface: Well , should it be larger buttons in general , you know like uh the examples that I had , they were swi quite small . So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ? marketing: I think we should . Like I think that would be in a as in {disfmarker} like in {disfmarker} for the design , sorry , um . I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote , 'cause most remotes have small square buttons , project manager: Mm . marketing: I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles . user interface: Ovals . Yeah , yeah . project manager: Okay . Okay , let's talk about all of our {disfmarker} We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let's um wrap up this one , and {vocalsound} I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint , 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . {vocalsound} Wait , come back . Alright . Sorry , let's go through this . Alright . Here we go . New product requirements . First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote . We're trying not to over-complicate things . So no D_V_D_ , no TiVo , no stereo . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: It's not gonna be multi-functional . user interface: {gap} project manager: Hey . And we th need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote . We're trying to get our name out there in the world . Okay . user interface: {gap} project manager: And you know what teletext is ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: {gap} in States we don't have it , but um it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , kind of sports , user interface: I know . marketing: What is it ? user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: it's very um bland looking , it's just text on the screen , user interface: Yeah , project manager: not even {disfmarker} user interface: it's like black , black and white kind of {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , just black with just text . marketing: Like running along the bottom ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: You can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so {disfmarker} user interface: It'll give you the sports . marketing: Wait , is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ? project manager: Kind of . user interface: Except the entire screen . project manager: Yeah it's the whole screen . industrial designer: It's the entire screen is just running information at random . project manager: So anyway {disfmarker} user interface: You can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment , industrial designer: Seemingly . user interface: you know it's like {disfmarker} project manager: Right . marketing: So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ? project manager: Right . But it's becoming out-dated now , because of the Internet . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , {vocalsound} and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so {disfmarker} Those are our new product requirements . Alright . Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: So , do we have to include the company colour within that ? project manager: Yes . It's part of the logo . Okay . user interface: Company colour being yellow . {vocalsound} project manager: What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting . So . Alright . {gap} Whatever . Okay . So our target group is {disfmarker} You mentioned um older people ? Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ? user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically {disfmarker} user interface: It's gonna make it nicer . Yeah . project manager: non-technically challenged people are gonna use it . I mean they want something user-friendly , so {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm well , even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: 'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons . project manager: Okay , so we want um for our target group would we say , I mean , young and old , all age ranges , all um , not kids obviously , right ? Or kids ? marketing: No , kids need to know how to use a remote , I would think . industrial designer: Most of them will intuitively pick it up though . project manager: {gap} marketing: They gotta change between Disney Channel , Cartoon Network . project manager: Okay , so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , I think we need it all . project manager: Um what about technic technical um specifications , like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ? industrial designer: {gap} marketing: Um I would say we should say dumber than the average person . project manager: Okay . user interface: We should go for the lowest denominator . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Right , okay . So so they need no technical experience to operate {disfmarker} user interface: High school educated . industrial designer: {gap} how 'bout little to no , because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no . project manager: Okay . And we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper . So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this . So if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes . user interface: Well it's channel , on-off button , volume , mute . project manager: Mm-hmm , volume . marketing: And channel . Yeah . Those are the most important ones . project manager: Right . And we wanna keep um {disfmarker} I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down . Correct , because people only use ten percent . marketing: Yeah . project manager: 'Kay . Hey , what else ? user interface: Um . project manager: Um . industrial designer: Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ? user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: I think so . What do you {disfmarker} marketing: Sure , yeah . user interface: {gap} project manager: A finding kind of device or {disfmarker} industrial designer: And marketing: I need {disfmarker} we we need a like homing device . project manager: Yeah , ho homing device . {vocalsound} industrial designer: like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ? user interface: Oh right yeah okay . project manager: Mm 'kay . user interface: Tracking . project manager: Okay . marketing: Because people really are looking for a remote that's more high-tech . project manager: Right . industrial designer: What if we gave it a charger ? And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you . user interface: But you got a base . marketing: Do you think people'll really go for that though ? industrial designer: It's useful for the remote phone . marketing: Because {disfmarker} project manager: Hmm . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Would that add to our costs at all , I wonder ? marketing: I would think so , because you'd have to develop a base . project manager: Right . user interface: Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Hmm . industrial designer: Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay . I I think we can make a decision about that later . Uh we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss . So that would include battery source {disfmarker} Power source rather . Is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that . marketing: Right . user interface: Well , then we could {disfmarker} marketing: Do w user interface: If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic . project manager: Mm . marketing: Well , th there's the people who desire speech recognition , there's the different demog demographics have different desires , I don't know if you guys ge project manager: You could um {disfmarker} we could hook it up . marketing: It wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black , project manager: Oh . marketing: but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition . So {vocalsound} basically older people don't really care . user interface: {gap} marketing: It's really the people twenty five to thirty five . I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of T_V_ though . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: And if and if we introduced it when they're this age , they're going to probably always buy a remote that has {disfmarker} user interface: Well {disfmarker} marketing: just sitcoms and stuff . Right . user interface: Well , then then do you put the voice recognition {disfmarker} do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote , marketing: So {disfmarker} user interface: 'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote , project manager: Right . user interface: whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it . project manager: Yeah . {gap} and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . If we said , find remote , locate remote , or something . marketing: Right . project manager: A certain phrase then it could beep . I dunno . Just throwing it out there . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Still {gap} fifteen minutes . project manager: Okay , anything else we wanna discuss ? user interface: Um . Well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ? Can we conceive of leaving them out ? project manager: Um . marketing: Wait , on the remote itself ? project manager: {gap} user interface: Yeah , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero . project manager: How how , marketing: Well , we definitely need those . project manager: yeah , how would you leave those out ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Well , I don't know , I mean , if you can {gap} like well {disfmarker} project manager: Unless you could say the channel . user interface: I don't know , if there's just a way of leaving them out ? industrial designer: I think people would find that too foreign . project manager: Yeah , that's true . marketing: Yeah . project manager: And also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too . marketing: You definitely need {disfmarker} project manager: I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . {vocalsound} So I couldn't {disfmarker} whenever I got cable , I had to get a new T_V_ . industrial designer: It's when we get satellite . project manager: Mm . {gap} get your own remote , or digital cable . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: 'Kay . Um . I guess , we're gonna discuss the project financing later , making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . Um . industrial designer: Yeah , 'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so {disfmarker} project manager: 'Kay . And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo . user interface: The colour being yellow ? marketing: Wait . project manager: I'm guessing . And the R_R_ . user interface: And how do we {disfmarker} marketing: I feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish . industrial designer: R_ the double R_ . project manager: We could just have the logo in yellow , user interface: Can't make it entirely {disfmarker} project manager: or maybe a yellow light for the keys . industrial designer: Or is the l marketing: Or put like stripes , oh yeah , yellow lights . industrial designer: Yeah , {vocalsound} yellow could be and it could {disfmarker} doesn't have to be huge . user interface: Well if you have like a {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: Hang on . If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom {gap} the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ . project manager: Right . So we've simplified , we don't need all those um play , fast-forward , rewind , user interface: Right , yeah . project manager: or no menu buttons . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Um can we go back to {disfmarker} I'm gonna look really quickly back at those user interface: Two examples . project manager: examples and see if there is anything . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Which one is yours , technical functions or functional requirement ? user interface: Oh , it's a {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: Okay . marketing: Yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour , or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ? project manager: The T_V_ . I think that that's fine just for the T_V_ . I mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ? user interface: Well , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away , you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much , but occasionally you will use . project manager: Hmm . user interface: and so it's like {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , 'cause we need to {disfmarker} we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . It's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful . project manager: Couldn't we do that all through one button , something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language , user interface: I don't {disfmarker} well , I don't know . project manager: you know ? user interface: Right . marketing: So we need up , down , and side-to-side buttons . project manager: For the menus . user interface: Well , that could be {disfmarker} No you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: That's true . user interface: Channel is just up and down . marketing: Yeah , okay . Okay , yeah . user interface: And then add a {disfmarker} project manager: Something that looks mayb you know . marketing: Such as , yeah , the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one . project manager: Y right , right right right . user interface: Yeah . project manager: That one ? user interface: So we just have it like {disfmarker} add a menu button then for the various things needed , project manager: Right . user interface: including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now project manager: In the middle perhaps . user interface: included in the menu . project manager: Yep . marketing: Ooh , I just got an idea for a design . project manager: {gap} good . Anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting ? industrial designer: I had something , but I forgot . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {gap} get out of here . Let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next . Mm . Alright . After this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e-mail . And then we're gonna have lunch break .
