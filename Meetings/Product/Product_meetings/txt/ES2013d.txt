industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Um almost , there's one more thing I have to get out of the {disfmarker} I have to make sure that this attachment will open . industrial designer: {vocalsound} I keep forgetting whether I've done this . {gap} . project manager: Ah-ha . Okay . We'll open that when the time is right . In the meantime {disfmarker} Closing things down , okay . Let's see what this thing does . Does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ? Ah , we came up together , we're good . Okay . Are we ready to start ? Okay . It's now quarter of four . This is a f another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five . Okay . Right . Our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes , then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria . We then have a finance aspect , which is a spreadsheet , an Excel spreadsheet . And I know what you're all thinking of , oh my , um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . So we're going to make a very fast track . Okay . Um and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing . So the first thing I have to do is close this so that I can get to {disfmarker} Where is it ? {vocalsound} marketing: Red . project manager: I need to open mine . Not the agenda . marketing: Agenda three . project manager: No that th I want the minutes from the previous {disfmarker} minutes . marketing: Mm . project manager: That should be there , minutes . Yeah . Okay . Uh from meeting three , is it alright with you if I don't switch it to show , just use it as is ? 'Cause this way I can more easily flip it . Okay , um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , we reviewed the previous minutes before that , um each of you made your presentations . {vocalsound} Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . The market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . Um we decided chip on print would be used . Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy . There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . Um looking like a scroll , but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling um that was actually in use , that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to Kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production . Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management . Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us . Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time . Um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one . And uh we closed as it ran out of time . Is that a fair presentation of what happened ? industrial designer: Yep . user interface: Yes . project manager: Okay , back to this meeting . Um we're down to the prototype presentation . industrial designer: Ta-da . user interface: Alright . project manager: Over to you . industrial designer: Right . user interface: Well . project manager: Ooh , two . user interface: Yeah , well you see , each made one , we didn't have enough yellow dough . project manager: Ah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: This is the one that I made . project manager: Uh-huh . user interface: It is uh curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons . This is like a scroll , but they are push buttons and they enter {disfmarker} takes you into the different menus . Of course we need someone who's experienced with the television {gap} . I mean this is the infrared thing that's gonna zap at the television . Uh I'm not quite sure how to make that , but I'm sure it will work . Uh this is on off switch , 'cause I think we do need that , and I think it gives it a nice balance . project manager: 'Kay . user interface: And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there . project manager: Okay . user interface: Um as for what it's actually made of {disfmarker} well the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right {vocalsound} in the different menus . project manager: Okay . user interface: Uh position , I presume that just means right right on it , easy to see . The main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , lack of uh buttons all over the place . Right ? {vocalsound} Form curved , kind of smooth , hand-held , makes it feel nice to hold . Uh material , I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit , but I think we have two different options , because we did make a another one , which wa uh is in the shape of banana , it's just {disfmarker} if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana , project manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . user interface: which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , just a slightly different design . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Also with on off switch and infrared {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic . So like uh {disfmarker} well , I dunno , what's it like ? I guess like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth . Whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one {disfmarker} or mix and match , just we were gonna see what you thought , the {disfmarker} uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons . So we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints . And what we well , what conclusion we reach when we discuss it . {vocalsound} Uh material {disfmarker} yeah , that's what I have to say about material . Can I scroll down on there and see what else {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: Well colour , I think {disfmarker} I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , because that's the company colours , but if anybody's got any other suggestions , I'm quite willing to consider them as well . {vocalsound} So , it just depends what you think about these ideas and if I'm {disfmarker} yeah , maybe , Kate , you better say what you think about them . industrial designer: Um well I don't have very much to add . Um the the case {disfmarker} oops , that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic . We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two , but it can be either of those . We have the technology to do that . Um and as for the the actual components um , uh Steph just said this is a {disfmarker} quite a cheap device to manufacture . We have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need . Um the um {vocalsound} the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end , it's the stalk of the banana , or it's just the thing at the end of this version . Um so that's for material . Colour , well uh Steph's the expert on colour . Um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that . Yeah , I think that's all we've got to say really . user interface: I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped . industrial designer: A banana . user interface: This one has n banana , yeah . This one has no obvious connections to fruit , but because it's round and molded , it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , it's more like {disfmarker} yeah , you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , which I quite like that sort of image . 'Cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly and industrial designer: {vocalsound} Would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ? user interface: {vocalsound} Hold them , you see , you know . Curvature , is it to your liking ? project manager: Oh I see , the on-off's in the back . industrial designer: Yes , that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it . user interface: {vocalsound} If you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all . project manager: And then you can use your thumb . {vocalsound} industrial designer: And it was partly we thought the design looked better , user interface: Yeah . {gap} project manager: I could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having a problem with the you know {disfmarker} user interface: Breaking , project manager: yeah . user interface: oh right . {vocalsound} Well you see , that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it , because then it'd just be rigid . marketing: I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role . project manager: Hmm . user interface: Yeah , {gap} we really like we really like that design , marketing: It's really kind of a {disfmarker} user interface: I mean it looks just like a logo , that arrangement of the keys . Like a c like a compass point , you know , marketing: Mm-hmm mm-hmm . user interface: just up , down , left and right , and we think we could make that quite a good feature . And it's like the the iPod scroll wheel , {vocalsound} but better . marketing: Yeah . But it's also like texting , user interface: Yeah . Yeah , yeah , marketing: you don't {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: I mean it {disfmarker} that's what it makes me think of , mobile phones , marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: I was try I was thinking , moving your thumb like this , what does that remind me of ? industrial designer: And it's a very simple design , marketing: Yeah . user interface: It's texting . industrial designer: there's not a lot to wrong , the components are cheap to make . marketing: It's also in terms of um being lost it's it's quite {disfmarker} it looks quite different . user interface: Hmm . marketing: You know , I I d I have several {disfmarker} four remotes , and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: you know , this is really identifiable . user interface: {vocalsound} I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of , you know , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen , marketing: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . user interface: but we do definitely think that it's a viable option . project manager: Okay . The next item is evaluation . marketing: No , okay . project manager: Uh if that's {disfmarker} if you're finished . user interface: {vocalsound} Uh yeah , we're finished . marketing: Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: shall I take your uh power ? project manager: Oh sorry . marketing: Oh . project manager: {vocalsound} Try again . marketing: Okay . This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation , and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department . So , this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise . So I'm going to go and use the whiteboard , and I've made a list of criteria to look at , and so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up as the last thing , but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , so one true seven false and I'm gonna now use the um the board . Okay . So um fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other . And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms , because these are things that um have been brought up , some of them seem rather close , user interface: Yeah , what about price , is that gonna go on there as well ? Price of materials . marketing: like they overlap . Mm , yeah , price . project manager: Hmm . marketing: We'll put price up at the top . user interface: {vocalsound} Not that we actually know anything about it , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: but we can we can pretend . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Well we will soon , unfortunately . marketing: Um Okay , so {disfmarker} project manager: Come on . marketing: Did you say {gap} ? project manager: No , {gap} . marketing: Uh okay , so wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ? user interface: It depends what what you mean by fancy really , 'cause when I think of fancy , I think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and , you know , like baroque curliness and {disfmarker} which marketing: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . user interface: I'd call these quite uh minimalist , industrial designer: Yes , a plain , simple , clean design . user interface: simple and plain , but I mean I do see what {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: so in that respect it is quite fancy . marketing: {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} yeah , so in that respect {disfmarker} I think we'll go with that respect . user interface: I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , I'd say maybe aesthetic . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well we have got s trendy further down , project manager: Elegant . industrial designer: but {disfmarker} project manager: Elegant . marketing: Elegant . industrial designer: Elegant , I don't know if I'd call them elegant . marketing: Yeah , no these aren't the exact terms that the um {disfmarker} user interface: {gap} like stylish or aesthetic . industrial designer: Stylish , yeah . marketing: Yeah . Elegant . We're gon let's use elegant , although the the the people , the word on the street is is {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: Fancy . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} N that {disfmarker} um user interface: Did you just break the pen ? project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: yeah uh {disfmarker} the uh {disfmarker} is fancy . So let's let's take it to the next level . user interface: Well d we'll just call it fancy then . marketing: Well okay , so in terms of elegant , fancy . we'll call it E_F_ um , do we do we think that perhaps {disfmarker} and maybe we should say the yellow ? Should we go with the yellow in terms of {disfmarker} I think that's a really superior {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , I think we n we need to {disfmarker} marketing: they're both {disfmarker} user interface: they're both yellow with black buttons , it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that , marketing: Yeah . project manager: Mm . user interface: but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black . marketing: Yeah . user interface: So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two marketing: Yeah . user interface: that isn't {disfmarker} that is more curved , like a banana , but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff , marketing: As a banana . user interface: so . marketing: I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana . project manager: Yeah . marketing: And of the two I really like I m I like the banana , project manager: The chunk . marketing: but I I do like the chunk . user interface: So that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now , is it . marketing: No , user interface: Just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two . marketing: but I mean in terms {disfmarker} we have to evaluate one of them . Unless {disfmarker} do you guys wanna evaluate both ? project manager: I think between the two , somewhere between the two is true . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , I'd {disfmarker} project manager: It's more true than false , about a two . marketing: Okay . So we say true . {vocalsound} technologically innovative . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I d I don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative . marketing: So we'll say {disfmarker} we'll say uh false . Easy to use . industrial designer: Very . user interface: Yes . marketing: {vocalsound} One , project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: is that inappropriate ? industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Okay . Oh , pardon me . Um project manager: Trendy . user interface: Oh yes . marketing: trendy , s {vocalsound} and I say specifically spongy fruity . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Well , maybe only a two or a three then , 'cause it's no we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific {disfmarker} industrial designer: We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy . project manager: Hmm . industrial designer: I think {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , I don't really think that's gonna work , industrial designer: yeah . user interface: but {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Okay , so two ? Um industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Excess buttons . marketing: are there excess buttons ? project manager: No . industrial designer: No . user interface: No . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That is false . industrial designer: So that's false . {vocalsound} marketing: Um {vocalsound} good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons . project manager: Better , more intuitive buttons , yes . marketing: True . Ugly . industrial designer: No . user interface: No . {vocalsound} project manager: No . marketing: People don't respond well to ugly . Sellable , uh quirky , you know , something people {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , I think they're different , aren't they ? user interface: Well it is quite it is quite quirky I think . marketing: like oh , project manager: I like it . marketing: yeah . Yeah , I do too . user interface: It could be quite a good brand , like a good little object . marketing: Oh yeah . And I was I was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it's cost saving ? With the {disfmarker} user interface: Oh , we also need tho think about the energy . Is it the kinetic energy ? marketing: Yeah , with the energy . industrial designer: Mm . {vocalsound} user interface: If it's {disfmarker} it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: It is going to be kinetic ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: we'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro . Yeah , Uh so yes . user interface: Yeah , but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet , so we're not completely sure about that , marketing: Well {vocalsound} user interface: but yeah . marketing: you're still in the Play-Doh stage . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Anything else ? Including price , do you have any idea about price or other features ? industrial designer: Well I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . We haven't got a lot of expensive components in there . project manager: Yes , the instinct says true . marketing: Okay . So true one or should I go to two or three ? industrial designer: I'd put it at one I think , but {disfmarker} I dunno , what do you {disfmarker} user interface: I would say maybe a two , marketing: Okay . user interface: 'cause we still {disfmarker} we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things . industrial designer: Yeah , true , user interface: I mean it's not just like {disfmarker} I mean it's not like ev you know , on a normal chunky remote every button res I mean means something different , project manager: Yeah , that's not a cheap thing to get . industrial designer: it might be the {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , true . True . user interface: whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all {disfmarker} they mean everything , depending on what menu you're in . project manager: Hmm . industrial designer: Yeah , that's a good point . user interface: {gap} uh we need somebody to develop that . marketing: Um other ? Anything else you guys can thing of ? And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these so then I'm gonna {disfmarker} instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true , so that {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: 'cause I have to do an average . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Right . marketing: And then um excess buttons . user interface: Just putting no excess buttons . marketing: Exactly . Wow we're doing really well . Yeah , be you know , user interface: As for {disfmarker} marketing: so it doesn't ruin the polarity . user interface: see if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative , because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition but but we are at the upper end of the push button market . {vocalsound} marketing: Or L_C_D_ . Yeah . Well if you g uh let me know if if any of these {disfmarker} um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here {disfmarker} if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features . If not I'll average those . project manager: I think we're good . marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . Mm . project manager: Okay . We're a little over halfway through the meeting marketing: So {disfmarker} project manager: and the next big thing is the finance . Okay . marketing: Um okay , how about if I uh pass this back to you project manager: Yep . marketing: and I'll uh figure out the average here . project manager: Right . marketing: Thank you for everyone's help with that . project manager: Right . And as you can see it says the same thing , it had not lost itself , thank Goodness . And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet that they provided to me . Um and it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells . Okay . user interface: Well , just kinetic then , {gap} . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Um what's a hand dynamo ? industrial designer: That was the crank , wind-up crank on the side . {vocalsound} user interface: It's the wind-up . project manager: Oh marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: shoot , forget that . Kinetic is um {disfmarker} and how many of those will we need per {disfmarker} we only need one . industrial designer: Just one . project manager: Okay . Electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those . industrial designer: Uh uh yeah , I think we can do it all with simple {disfmarker} Just checking that . Yeah , simple , 'cause we've just got push buttons , so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest . project manager: Okay , and we only need one of those . industrial designer: Yep . project manager: Okay , the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . It looks like it {gap} single curve , 'cause of th the chunkiness . It's {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , that that one is single curve , project manager: that's uh uh one . industrial designer: isn't it ? Um do we have project manager: And that's user interface: What does double curved mean , I don't understand . industrial designer: I I think you {disfmarker} it means you reverse the curve . project manager: uh that's the the one that goes like this . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah , I do I don't think we need that for either of them , user interface: Oh no , we don't need that . No . project manager: Right . industrial designer: you can do a banana in single curve , project manager: No , user interface: Single-curved , I'd say . project manager: single curve . industrial designer: yeah . project manager: Okay , case material supplements . Plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour . user interface: I industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: I just wanna say plastic . project manager: We had the special colour . And did we say plastic ? industrial designer: Yeah , can we do some what ifs , 'cause it may {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , marketing: One , two , three , four , five , six . industrial designer: but it depends on the cost , I guess . project manager: Okay . We'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added at the moment , that's where we are . Interface button {disfmarker} push button interface . That's what we're using , user interface: It's just button . industrial designer: Yes . user interface: Yeah . project manager: isn't it ? industrial designer: Yep . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Do we need to say how many buttons , or project manager: Whoops , don't want that , not yet . Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: or d is it just one ? project manager: No , it just says push button interface . Button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black . industrial designer: 'Kay . project manager: And the buttons {disfmarker} Wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ? industrial designer: Uh they'll be rubber , yep . project manager: So we need one of them . And are they any special form ? user interface: Well yeah , like the compass point one . industrial designer: Actually , does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ? 'Cause I think they can be plastic . project manager: 'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top . industrial designer: Yeah . They could be plastic , we don't have to have rubber buttons , project manager: Oh . industrial designer: because we haven't got a double curved case . user interface: Yeah , they could be plastic . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . Um let's put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement . industrial designer: It's just one , isn't it ? project manager: Uh we only need one of them . Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed . industrial designer: What , we're in . marketing: Yeah . project manager: We're in . {vocalsound} That's us . industrial designer: More profit . user interface: Great . project manager: Okay , I'm going to save this into our {vocalsound} desktop , project documents . Okay . As our project document bit . industrial designer: Do you do you need to double click on that to open it ? project manager: Yeah . There we are . That's the only Excel document that will be in there , so it's there for all of us . Okay , so , are they under twelve fifty ? Yes , go to the project evaluation , next slide . user interface: Yes . project manager: Right . Um the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity . Yeah , leadership , teamwork , user interface: Yeah . marketing: Sure . Yes . project manager: means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: And Play-Doh . project manager: Uh-huh . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah , the Play-Doh was best , I thought . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah well , 'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder . So much better just to go and , you know , this is it , this is what we want . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yep . project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} So , we went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above . marketing: Yep . project manager: Um did we find any new ideas ? marketing: I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I {disfmarker} that really opened my eyes . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} Spongy . marketing: I I only speak for myself though . user interface: And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before , industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: so . Good work as a design team , industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , I think we're a good team actually . user interface: because we {disfmarker} industrial designer: I'm not sure all the wires are really great though . project manager: So we actually worked well as a group . industrial designer: I thought so . project manager: Right . Are the costs within the budget ? Yes . user interface: Oh yes . marketing: Yes . project manager: Is the project evaluated ? industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Yes . industrial designer: Yes . user interface: Yes . marketing: I can give you a number , industrial designer: hang on , Oh we haven't heard . {vocalsound} project manager: Uh-huh . marketing: um it's uh {disfmarker} the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , so it means w you know , I can I can spell it out . There were six true or ones , four um pardon me , two s almost true or close to true , so that was four points , and then uh one false , seven points , so seventeen divided by nine {disfmarker} we're between one and two . I would say that's ex excellent in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place . user interface: Yeah . And the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology , marketing: To maintain old technology , exactly . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works , marketing: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Absolutely , and it's kept us within budget . user interface: so . Yeah . marketing: Yes . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: So we do count as I think excellent or one . project manager: Alright . user interface: {gap} . project manager: And we've therefore {disfmarker} we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , I have a final report to present , um and then we're done . marketing: Okay . project manager: We done good , and we're finished in time . user interface: Bring on the ice sculptures . marketing: Nice . industrial designer: And then we get the product launch party . marketing: So we might have to wait . industrial designer: Product launch party ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: That's what I said , ice sculptures . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Absolutely . {vocalsound} marketing: Um I {disfmarker} one thing I want to do is {disfmarker} oh , I think the meeting's done . project manager: I believe that is the end of our meeting . Thank you , Melissa . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . Um one thing I wa I wanna do is save everything in the right files , because I don't think everything is saved . The right files . Final meeting market
