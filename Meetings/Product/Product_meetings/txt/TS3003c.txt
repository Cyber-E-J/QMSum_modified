project manager: Okay . Uh good afternoon . This is our third meeting already . marketing: Good afternoon . project manager: I hope you enjoyed your lunch . {vocalsound} I did anyway . {vocalsound} Um let's see . Presentation three . Okay this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today . It's the conceptual design meeting . And a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components . Uh conceptual specification of design . And also trend-watching . Um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations you're going to show me in a few minutes . Um but first I'll show you the agenda . Uh first the opening . Then we have three presentations . Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . How we're going to make it . And then we're closing . We have about forty minutes . Uh so I suggest let's get started . Uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ? No ? user interface: No . project manager: Everything fine ? marketing: {gap} project manager: That's nice . Then a little uh thing about the last meeting . Uh these are the points um we agreed on . The requirements and the target market . Uh requirements are uh teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that uh button information . And we are going to use default materials . Um does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? Maybe ? No ? These are just the the things we thought of , so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . And maybe we can uh work it out . And we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers . So now everybody knows what we're do we're doing , um I suggest let's get started with the presentations . So shall we keep the same uh line-up as uh last time ? marketing: Sure . project manager: Okay . marketing: I'll start off then . project manager: Good luck . {vocalsound} marketing: Doh . 'Kay I'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days . Um we've done some market research . We distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends . And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the the best design would be . Um okay these are some overall findings . Um most important thing is the fancy design . Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor . Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls . Um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . Um for our um group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal . 'Kay these are some more group specific findings . Uh the older people prefer dark colours . Uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people . Um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have . Um this leads us to some personal preferences . Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room . Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . Just keep it simple and {disfmarker} Well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the {disfmarker} These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control . So this would be very important that we {vocalsound} at least include these features . Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . This is not really {disfmarker} This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . People with more money . Uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means . That would be all . project manager: Okay . Thank you . Any questions about the the trends ? marketing: Any questions ? project manager: Mayb user interface: Mm no . project manager: No ? Okay , we go on to the next one . user interface: {gap} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Um {vocalsound} 'kay um yeah . {gap} uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . So uh um uh that's w what I what I want to uh uh to do in uh our design . So um finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . Um the uh {disfmarker} I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition . So maybe uh we can uh use uh that . Um {disfmarker} Uh and uh using a little uh display . So um findings . Um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions . So uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . Um uh let's see . Um yeah and {disfmarker} Uh {gap} we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . So uh it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting . Um and yeah overall um user-friendly . So uh using uh large large buttons . Um {disfmarker} It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . So uh uh yeah . And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off or {disfmarker} A and uh yeah . Television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh . Um {disfmarker} Let's see . Uh yeah . I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , um just one button to keep it uh simple . Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles . Um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles . So uh {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we've got um the buttons we have to use . The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine . Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons . And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . So um made a little uh picture of uh it . Um {disfmarker} See . Um yeah . Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place . Um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: So um {disfmarker} D display uh of it , it's uh just a small display . Uh um you can put it uh on top . Um it's uh most uh uh place where people uh , most of {gap} looks at . So uh um and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the {disfmarker} So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . Um it's uh quite uh handy place . So um and uh all the f functions for subtitle uh one button , uh for sound uh {disfmarker} Uh and uh for our design , um uh we have to discuss about it uh I think uh so uh the form of it so {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . user interface: And that's it . project manager: Uh thank you . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay . About the components design . Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . So I don't think it's really an option . Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . It's really up the the design that we're gonna use . It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions . Uh as a case supplement , we could um , I thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip . Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . And the chip-set , um it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen . And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood , but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . Form should follow function overall . Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . But depends on what we want . I think we should disc discuss that . Um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . And the chip-set uh really should be advanced because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control . And that's it . project manager: Okay . Thank you . So that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . Mm . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: 'Kay . So these are the points we have to discuss . Um first I think we can talk about the energy source , since that's um has a pretty big influence on production price , uh and image . user interface: {gap} project manager: Uh so uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , I think . industrial designer: Yes w there there are four options . We could use the basic normal battery . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Uh a hand dynamo . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay {gap} . {vocalsound} industrial designer: But I don't think that's {vocalsound} really an option . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: You don't wanna swing before you can watch television . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: Uh solar cells . But not every room is very light user interface: Mm . industrial designer: so it's not a very good option . project manager: No . industrial designer: Or the kinetic energy . project manager: Yeah . Okay . marketing: And how exactly does the kinetic energy work ? industrial designer: Well y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up . marketing: You just {disfmarker} You use it and it works . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Nah . marketing: Okay . Well personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . That's true . marketing: And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . industrial designer: Oh . marketing: And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um get great popularity for our product . project manager: Yeah . user interface: But marketing: Um wel user interface: what's the function ? Yeah f for loading up uh the batteries {gap} . marketing: Yeah you could load up the batteries , user interface: B b marketing: you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there . user interface: Okay but uh it won't use uh much e energy uh I I believe . Uh it's uh just a small display so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more . So I believe one battery uh is just enough . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} user interface: Uh so {disfmarker} project manager: Uh well I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place . marketing: That's true . {vocalsound} project manager: And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . user interface: Okay . project manager: So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place . user interface: Yeah . That's true . Yeah . project manager: And also what you said . Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . user interface: Yeah . project manager: So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . user interface: Okay . project manager: And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels . user interface: Yeah . Uh . project manager: That's safe . marketing: I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ? project manager: Yeah . That's a good point . industrial designer: Mm I don't have any information on pricing . So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department . user interface: Mm . marketing: 'Cause in our earlier um market research , if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard . project manager: Yeah , sure . Go ahead . marketing: Um so it was open here . Um we also um asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Well you can see here , our target group would not do that . project manager: No . marketing: So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control user interface: Mm . marketing: I would greatly advise not to do it . project manager: Yeah . user interface: {gap} marketing: I think that would be better to uh insert in our other product , that is meant for the project manager: Yeah . marketing: younger people . user interface: 'Kay . industrial designer: But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess . It's a bit higher percentage , but {disfmarker} marketing: Um well this is Yeah but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it . And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use . project manager: Easier to use ? No , I think that's a good point . user interface: But uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh L_C_D_ sh uh display , or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use ? marketing: Um well this was for like an L_C_D_ screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones . user interface: Okay . marketing: So pretty large . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it . Because it's just uh some extra information , user interface: No . project manager: and it's easy to ignore as well . So if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it . user interface: Yeah . project manager: And um yeah I think the um {disfmarker} Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition . Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly . And I don't think the {disfmarker} I don't think it will be a lot easier to use , as well . user interface: Yeah . project manager: So that brings us back to the energy . If we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use a lot of energy to use . Um {disfmarker} user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: So in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . And much cheaper as well . user interface: Yeah . project manager: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: And that's the best choice . project manager: Okay let me just choose for the battery . That brings us to the chip . industrial designer: Well there isn't any choice there because we're using the the the the display . project manager: Just the advanced . industrial designer: So it's gotta be advanced . project manager: Okay marketing: 'Kay . project manager: {gap} , advanced chip . And then we get to the point of the case . Um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . Or both ? Um as we saw there is not {disfmarker} Yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Um but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Look I've got a new remote control , and uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Uh I dunno . marketing: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour . So it wouldn't actually have to be wood , project manager: Yeah . That's right . marketing: if it's just user interface: Mm . marketing: wood-coloured . project manager: But with colour was a lot more expensive ? Or ? industrial designer: Mm I dunno . project manager: You don't know ? industrial designer: I'll have to uh research . project manager: I think so because {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: Probably . project manager: It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape . user interface: Mm . Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . So um uh you 'cause uh {disfmarker} Yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it . project manager: Yeah . user interface: So project manager: Change the cases . Yeah . user interface: maybe it's possible uh possibility . So um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control , and um yeah you can sell uh few uh {disfmarker} project manager: You can sell the cases . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . I think that's a very good option . Because um then you can advertise as well with the {disfmarker} Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Because that's a {disfmarker} it's something extra , it's something other remotes don't have , user interface: Yeah . project manager: which we can get a great advantage point . marketing: Yeah that is true . project manager: So and then you can make them with colour . Black and grey , other colours as well . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . We would have to look carefully into the design though . project manager: Costs . marketing: 'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . The more original one , or the more standard one . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . So marketing: So that would {disfmarker} project manager: you suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply , yeah {vocalsound} remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example . marketing: Well I wouldn't design a telephone industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Well no I think w we should just , we should then just design one um project manager: Remote . marketing: one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . project manager: Yeah . Okay . marketing: So , but that shouldn't be too much of a problem . project manager: So everybody's okay with the changing covers ? I think that's a good uh good option . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Changing case covers . marketing: Um I heard our Industrial Designer talk about uh flat , single and double curved . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes . marketing: Could you explain that a little more ? industrial designer: Well the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: And uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases . marketing: And what would single curved and double curved mean ? industrial designer: Um it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know . So it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use . It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality . marketing: Okay . So we can pretty much just do whatever we want . industrial designer: Pick one you like , yes . project manager: Mm . Okay . marketing: 'Kay . That's good . project manager: Uh but the form has to be um {disfmarker} It has to {disfmarker} It's has to be possible to stand up ? Or just only to lie down ? marketing: No just to lie down . user interface: {gap} okay . project manager: And the the cover of the the docking station is also marketing: We'll go for that . project manager: on top of the television then ? Or not ? marketing: Well or besides it . project manager: And you can just yeah then click it in . That's okay . Um so the interface . What type of interface do we want to use ? Um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the marketing: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . project manager: on the the board . user interface: Mm . project manager: Does somebody have ideas for a form or user interface: Uh we can just use the regular form of it , but it's um not quite uh fancy . So um {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: Um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side , user interface: Yeah . marketing: so you could , so your thumb would be easily {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Well uh I think that was a very good point 'cause I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause R_S_I_ . user interface: {gap} marketing: So that would be great for that . Um I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side . user interface: For uh {disfmarker} Uh for {disfmarker} marketing: For left-handed users also . user interface: Yeah yeah . project manager: Yep . user interface: Mm . Yeah we Is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? And on the uh other uh {vocalsound} uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting , uh for for the sound ? Or {disfmarker} Or isn't it ? marketing: For the volume . Um well project manager: Mm . marketing: that could {gap} Yeah we could do that but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use . project manager: Usabili Yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult , user interface: Yeah okay . project manager: and then it's {disfmarker} user interface: Uh . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: But if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote . user interface: Mm . marketing: 'Cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff . user interface: Yeah project manager: But you have extra buttons . user interface: but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: So people can get confused . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: That is true . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Especially if they have the same writings on it . user interface: See um yeah . Or we have to make a left uh {disfmarker} For lefties project manager: Can't we make uh {disfmarker} Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same user interface: and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} project manager: functions as the normal one ? user interface: {vocalsound} You mean um {disfmarker} project manager: Then you have to {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah if {disfmarker} project manager: Let's see if I ca A blank one . And then you get {disfmarker} Here's a little L_C_D_ screen . Uh now I have to think . It's a plus and a min . No it's not very handy I think . Because the plus and the min will be opposite user interface: Mm no . project manager: and all kinds of {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: No that's not gonna work . I guess . Maybe we should {disfmarker} user interface: Um {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ? I think the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel marketing: Yeah . That is true . project manager: or {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . It's just uh u using uh your thumb . project manager: Y yeah . Yeah . user interface: So um it's {disfmarker} project manager: I think we could just uh leave it a normal shape . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Uh but maybe we have to make it a l a bit more fancy . In one or ano another way . user interface: Yeah . Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: I think we should start by by choosing a case . Because that's the basis you're building on . user interface: Yeah yeah . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Um yeah industrial designer: So I could draw them out . project manager: just {disfmarker} industrial designer: Let's look at the flat case . Oh . It's from the side so it's rather normal . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: The the single curved so I'm not really sure what they're gonna look like , but I think it's something like this . So this type should be better for you or better {disfmarker} Should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit . project manager: Easier ? industrial designer: And the double curved s looks something like this I guess . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: So th those are the three options we have . project manager: 'Kay . marketing: Mm . project manager: I suggest um the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in . user interface: {gap} project manager: Uh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it's a bit , it has a bit of a angle . user interface: So um {disfmarker} Do you say this um {disfmarker} S uh {disfmarker} Uh you got like uh sort of a {disfmarker} I believe {disfmarker} {gap} There ? marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: So um you want to put a display over here ? Or not ? project manager: Yeah . I think so . Yeah . user interface: Yeah . Um {disfmarker} Yeah . Uh project manager: But now it's {disfmarker} user interface: we can make it um {disfmarker} project manager: Do you have it upside down or {disfmarker} user interface: Mm ? project manager: Do you have it user interface: That's the top . project manager: this that's top ? Okay . user interface: So uh this top . This down . Um maybe it's possible to uh make this side like um {disfmarker} Let's see . Um {disfmarker} Colour uh okay . Uh to make this side um like mm the right colour . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand . So um {disfmarker} Uh it's an {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . user interface: So so the remote control have to um lay in your hand . So uh it's possib um yeah for s so and project manager: So get your mouse . Yeah . user interface: And to put uh the the buttons for um changing uh the channel uh over here uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . That's a good one . But I think it's better to put the screen uh on top . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} Uh rem project manager: So just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get {disfmarker} {gap} here . user interface: Yeah but this place um {disfmarker} project manager: If you can have this one , you turn it like this . And then flip it upside down . user interface: Uh it's {disfmarker} Yeah I dunno um {disfmarker} project manager: Because uh maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: {gap} industrial designer: It's more logical to have it on top as well project manager: I think i industrial designer: because , like on your mobile phone , it's always above . user interface: Yeah so {disfmarker} project manager: On top . marketing: Yeah . user interface: So {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Oh maybe you should just s start on a blank page . project manager: {gap} . So marketing: Yeah . project manager: then we get {disfmarker} Here's {disfmarker} That's the curve . user interface: Five minutes . {vocalsound} project manager: Here the display , and then buttons . Yeah and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . Just that's for left hand and right hand users . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: And then h the rest of the buttons over here . user interface: Yeah . But um the on-off button , um still on the top uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah still here user interface: Yeah . project manager: jus user interface: Yeah . project manager: That's {disfmarker} marketing: And I'd prefer the corners to be round . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . 'Kay . project manager: Should be more bit more friendly , marketing: Think that would be better . project manager: yeah . marketing: Friendly on the eye . project manager: 'Kay . Supplements . That's okay . Where's my mouse ? Then {disfmarker} We've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use . So now for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design . It's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote . So check out the corporate website maybe . The user interface design , it's the same story . And product evaluation . So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one . But you're going to get your instructions I think sended by the coach . So just um I will put these um minutes on the in the folder . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: And then we're going to uh try to finish our project , and uh make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , I think . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Which are {disfmarker} Uh let's see . I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or {disfmarker} I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first . user interface: Yeah . project manager: And then you'll get a message . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: So that's uh basically it . Maybe this one ? Then we can save this one in the folders group . Uh yes , it's here . marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} SMARTboard , there it it . So if you wanna have a look at it , it's over there in the projects folder . user interface: Yeah . project manager: And then I guess we'll start in thirty minutes again . Thank you . marketing: Very good . user interface: Okay .
