user interface: That's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button . industrial designer: Like this one . user interface: But uh we don't uh we don't uh {disfmarker} we do think it's um well {disfmarker} what if with ease of use , w which prefers the {disfmarker} which the the customer of the user prefers . industrial designer: It's important . Uh I think th this is device which which has a learning curve . Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control . And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often . But other users who are new to this device need something like that . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: They n they need to understand what {disfmarker} uh how to change channels and uh change the volume , so it's easier for them project manager: Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ? A a and the voice recognition as well , industrial designer: Yeah , maybe so . Yes , it's {disfmarker} project manager: th maybe you could uh could uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our um {gap} . {vocalsound} There are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: It's it's quite easy . project manager: Okay . Okay , good . And and the case is is rubber ? industrial designer: Yes , rubber ? project manager: And the buttons ? user interface: {vocalsound} Plastic or rubber . industrial designer: {vocalsound} There are plastic or rubber . user interface: Well , project manager: Okay , user interface: yeah . project manager: and uh the colouring ? industrial designer: Uh yellow with uh project manager: {gap} with with grey or black . industrial designer: grey or black or something like that . Whatever cost uh cost uh the least . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Okay , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: we'll we'll come to that later . Um industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: okay . Anything else to add or {disfmarker} industrial designer: No . {vocalsound} Uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} But {disfmarker} marketing: Well , you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button , industrial designer: Yes , but it {disfmarker} marketing: 'cause you have to assign two channel {disfmarker} new channels . industrial designer: but these are tasks that are only executed once , I think . project manager: M uh yeah . industrial designer: Or not ? project manager: M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition . marketing: You {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well okay . Okay , yeah , that's right . Or something li like that . user interface: And a button for disabling the voice recognition . project manager: Yeah al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it {disfmarker} you'd disable it with a little beep and and {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes . user interface: Yeah . project manager: but o okay , that that's not really really important . user interface: {vocalsound} That's the basic idea , yeah . Of our prototype . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: The basic {disfmarker} okay . Okay . Um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ? marketing: Yes . project manager: Okay . marketing: Uh my name is not name project manager: {vocalsound} You are nameless . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: but {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh well , I used the {gap} {disfmarker} the uh {gap} documents . And these uh were the most important criteria . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Is it spongy ? {vocalsound} marketing: It should be . {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . Fancy look and feel . So {disfmarker} user interface: So just walk through it step by step . I mean , is it fancy , everything {disfmarker} I believe uh I believe it's fancy . {vocalsound} marketing: Uh well appar industrial designer: I believe it's fancy too . marketing: Yeah , but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet . project manager: No . user interface: Oh , sorry . marketing: So {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , so industrial designer: Okay . project manager: this {disfmarker} these are the cr uh the criteria . marketing: Yeah , I think these are the most important criteria . project manager: Okay , well {disfmarker} marketing: So uh project manager: the then we'll switch to my presentation . Um {disfmarker} marketing: that's about it . project manager: The production costs . The costs are not under {disfmarker} Can I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um this is the {disfmarker} user interface: Twenty two . project manager: Yeah , it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty . user interface: Yikes . project manager: And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . So I guess we should skip that , industrial designer: Well it's very expensive . project manager: because it's not that important . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Why does the price and and the s oh , one uh exa project manager: Yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum . user interface: yeah . The number of uh {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: Um well , this is what I would call our luxury model . Um if you would {disfmarker} user interface: And and does it {disfmarker} project manager: if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um {vocalsound} to make it {vocalsound} just between the twelve Euro fifty , um then I did the following changes . Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature , industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Um {disfmarker} Yeah , I believe {disfmarker} Uh , push-button , well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It makes it the thirteen {disfmarker} yeah . Push-buttons are {disfmarker} buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: So um {disfmarker} yeah , th this design is not um within our price model . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: But I'm afraid it's not complete . Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item . And you have not added one item there . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: So it's c way too expensive . project manager: It's still too expensive , yeah . Um {disfmarker} user interface: But that's that's only for the buttons . project manager: I I guess if we leave the {disfmarker} if we leave this one out , um {disfmarker} user interface: So the button we can use plastic . project manager: oh . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: And uh maybe not use the special form . user interface: And the pla uh {disfmarker} And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber . industrial designer: But it {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} It becomes a very dull remote control , I know . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: But it's the board decision . Um {disfmarker} And um {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: Well , b basically it {vocalsound} {disfmarker} when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions . project manager: Yeah . Yeah , I know . Maybe we should look at an {disfmarker} uh focus on another uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: So {disfmarker} Type of m maybe another market segment . project manager: Yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and uh m maximise the profits industrial designer: Yes . project manager: and um {disfmarker} industrial designer: That's {disfmarker} maybe that's better . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Maybe we could uh {disfmarker} we should go for straight and simple , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: but that's not what uh has been asked . project manager: I know , I know . industrial designer: So we should kick the board's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Although I think we {disfmarker} yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no . {vocalsound} It's not that innovative . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Or however you s pronounce that . user interface: Yeah , too bad . {vocalsound} project manager: Um so , okay . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Oh , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: this is the wrong one . So uh that means redesign . {vocalsound} We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Um {vocalsound} but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . I guess {disfmarker} marketing: Um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , that's true . industrial designer: Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good . project manager: We l we can learn . Yeah . Yeah . I agree . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} project manager: Well {disfmarker} industrial designer: Is it fancy ? {vocalsound} project manager: I d it is it is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yay . Is it ? Is it fancy ? project manager: Yeah , I think so . user interface: Um the yellow rubber , I think so . industrial designer: I think so . project manager: {vocalsound} You like the rubber , uh Roo . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} I'm into it . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: So uh one ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: But it's not that fancy . project manager: No , I'll I'll I'll give it a two . industrial designer: I mean I think uh {disfmarker} I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing {disfmarker} the casing . It would be even more {disfmarker} project manager: You like tita {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: oh , you really like titanium . I'm I'm into it . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: That's a flavour as well . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: It has flavour . Yes , that's right . {vocalsound} You should taste it . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Right . Um {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , I know , marketing: Is it uh {disfmarker} project manager: but but it {disfmarker} but that's fancy in the way um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean fancy has has a lot of {disfmarker} industrial designer: It has to do with fashion , I guess . project manager: Yeah . user interface: It's trendy trendy , fun {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: So do {disfmarker} marketing: And w user interface: yeah . marketing: yeah , w what they want {disfmarker} wanted was uh colours and soft materials . project manager: Yeah . marketing: So in that way {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it's fancy . project manager: It applies . It {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: Well , just {vocalsound} give it a two . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes . user interface: It's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: I think I th I think it would have been {disfmarker} I would have think {disfmarker} uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar . user interface: Yeah , but that's sti that's uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: So {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't {disfmarker} we don't have the double-curved case . We w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . That's two out of three . So I believe uh we are close uh to two . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Yeah , I I agree . industrial designer: Yes , I agree too . It's okay . We did {gap} {disfmarker} yes , we did good . marketing: Okay , and uh was it innovative ? user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Well , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: with the voice recognition feature and uh {disfmarker} user interface: But that's not in it . Ov or can we {disfmarker} marketing: Yep . project manager: No , we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype . industrial designer: Well , let's let's {disfmarker} this product . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative . project manager: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} And the scroll uh wheel . The solar {disfmarker} not many remotes have the solar , I think . industrial designer: No . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , and uh {disfmarker} project manager: That would have been a thrill . industrial designer: yes , but {disfmarker} marketing: So uh also a uh two ? industrial designer: I think uh it's a two . project manager: Yep . marketing: Is it easy to use ? project manager: I'm not sure . {vocalsound} I'm not sure . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . Well , hard {disfmarker} it's not for the for the e for the elderly . They won't use it . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . So in that in that way it is advanced , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users . user interface: I think {disfmarker} I think a three . industrial designer: So uh {disfmarker} It's maybe {disfmarker} it's not very uh easy for {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Wouldn't give it more . project manager: Uh I'm doubting {disfmarker} doubting as well . Um {disfmarker} marketing: Well the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . project manager: Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ? industrial designer: Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I {gap} {disfmarker} I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: because he is already {disfmarker} he or she is already an advanced user . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} project manager: Um {disfmarker} Okay . industrial designer: After all , I think {disfmarker} personally I would give a two . But {disfmarker} project manager: Uh Roo , a three ? user interface: Yep . project manager: Ruud ? marketing: Good question . Uh I'll go uh for the two . project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten . project manager: So I could make it e easy ? user interface: If you make it a four it will be three in general . industrial designer: So that's w No , two and a half . user interface: If he makes it a four . Not a three . industrial designer: Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . So {disfmarker} user interface: Darn . Nee . industrial designer: Yes . {vocalsound} marketing: Hmm ? Huh ? project manager: Roo . {vocalsound} user interface: A seven , a three {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No . marketing: Yeah . I yeah {gap} . user interface: A four and a three together . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Four ? user interface: Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ? marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: Two ? marketing: two , two , three {disfmarker} project manager: No , user interface: And a three ? project manager: I haven't said anything yet . user interface: Nee . I know . marketing: No . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five . industrial designer: Divided by four . user interface: Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three {disfmarker} three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: But I'm filling in a three . industrial designer: That's not even {disfmarker} project manager: Does it {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} so it will be a two point five . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: But that's not possible to fill in , project manager: Yes , it is . industrial designer: so we have to round it . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Is it easy to find ? {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} I have a veto . {vocalsound} Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about {disfmarker} okay , um is it easy to f Yeah , definitely . user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: Yes . user interface: we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . industrial designer: It it most definitely is {disfmarker} it's very easy . project manager: Yeah , or beeps or {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes . Maybe {disfmarker} Uh I I think I think {disfmarker} project manager: I'm here , I'm here . {vocalsound} industrial designer: something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . user interface: But even without it {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Well , I uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: So , I th project manager: we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Um Sebastian ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , me too . user interface: Me too . marketing: Yeah , I agree . project manager: Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: it can't be more spongy . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is {disfmarker} um can be {disfmarker} uh how d how do you prono is is moldable . user interface: Was it one of our options ? industrial designer: No , it's not one of our option , marketing: No . Uh project manager: No okay , but but user interface: So , in the in {disfmarker} industrial designer: but when you look in the market , when you look {disfmarker} marketing: this this was a most spongy option . {vocalsound} project manager: for the options given , it's the most spongy one . industrial designer: Uh yes , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics {disfmarker} characteristics with uh market {disfmarker} uh with with the real market . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} They're out there . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes , but it's not good enough , project manager: {vocalsound} I'll give it a one . industrial designer: so it's a two . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I wan I'll take one . industrial designer: You take one ? What do you give it ? marketing: Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number . {vocalsound} marketing: but {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: Because we need to go on {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} for the time . marketing: Well , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation . user interface: It will be a one . {vocalsound} marketing: So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five . industrial designer: No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} You are {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: okay . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: The remote control offers enough features . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ? marketing: Well , the basic layout doesn't offem {disfmarker} offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Basically it's it's completely programmable . marketing: Yeah , depends . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode . project manager: Yeah , I know . industrial designer: So it's quite advanced . project manager: What what we didn't talk about is um uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , but {vocalsound} it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's {disfmarker} If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is {disfmarker} it has all the features um a normal remote has . project manager: I think it has . marketing: Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat project manager: Yeah . Bec because you can um {disfmarker} we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . So , industrial designer: Yes . project manager: you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um {gap} {disfmarker} the the signals . industrial designer: Has uh the signals sent to it . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Signal . project manager: So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to {disfmarker} as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features . industrial designer: Absolutely . project manager: Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced . industrial designer: Yes . But that {disfmarker} that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . And this is quite s simple . project manager: Yep . industrial designer: You can use your voice to to programme it . It's {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the {disfmarker} for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one . user interface: I'll give a two . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , I'll give it a one . marketing: Um I think think a one , 'cause {gap} v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes . I I've {disfmarker} I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} project manager: So high quality , low acceptance . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced . But {vocalsound} whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is {disfmarker} well , is not sure . industrial designer: Yes . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . project manager: D do you agree ? industrial designer: Yes , I agree . I {disfmarker} marketing: Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe we should have a radar uh {vocalsound} function . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , okay . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yes . user interface: But we could {disfmarker} couldn't uh {disfmarker} what what's the selling price ? Fifty ? project manager: Twenty five Euros . user interface: Uh twenty five . And costs were twelve fifty . project manager: Yeah . user interface: But even now , if only our production costs w {vocalsound} uh were exceeded the double , Think . Production cost was {disfmarker} were t uh was twenty two ? project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: So uh {gap} selling price uh would be uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: M about fifty Euros . user interface: yeah . industrial designer: That's quite ex user interface: That's price , but w w industrial designer: well , it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality . user interface: No . An original remote control of any T_V_ kind , uh a Phillips remote control , y you pay uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes , it's more than fifty Euros . It's quite expensive , yes . user interface: Yeah , I kn I know uh from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders . project manager: Bu but {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} yeah , I know , but you're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros . industrial designer: Yes . Yes , but you can you c Yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition project manager: {gap} . industrial designer: and this one does . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: So I think it's worth its price . project manager: Okay . Um you had an overall rating . Um {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} with these ratings uh project manager: That's counting . industrial designer: Well , it's it's about one point five . Something like that . marketing: should be about one point s seven , user interface: Four six seven eight . marketing: yeah . project manager: Okay . user interface: Nine divided by six . project manager: Okay . Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . About the project itself , not about the product . Um {disfmarker} What did you think about uh the process , the project process ? Ruud ? marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Try to translate that . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Hmm . {vocalsound} project manager: Any any other {disfmarker} Uh , Roo ? user interface: Yeah , I think uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well , I think {disfmarker} marketing: Ye project manager: {vocalsound} Roo . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} The process was good . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs . project manager: Yeah . user interface: And and that was the the big deal . I if we knew that before , we c we could have made industrial designer: Mm . Actually , we had {disfmarker} user interface: the the choice between {gap} what {disfmarker} project manager: Better decision . industrial designer: Yes . user interface: yeah . industrial designer: We had we had too little information actually . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} And uh um the the the {disfmarker} well , looking at room for creativity , there was w way too {disfmarker} the the choice of components was way too narrow . project manager: Less . Yeah . industrial designer: So there was not really a process of uh {disfmarker} project manager: So we could we we could be {disfmarker} we could've been creative . But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price . industrial designer: Well {disfmarker} Yes . marketing: The prices . industrial designer: Well , in the first meeting we we already were very creative . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: We we thought of possibilities {vocalsound} who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components . So {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: We're tempered by that , yes . project manager: Okay , Roo ? Any other thoughts on that ? user interface: No , no . project manager: Ruud ? marketing: I agree . project manager: You agree , okay . Uh leadership . user interface: Fantastic . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Okay , Roo's on for his promotion . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , {gap} okay . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: I think we're a good team . project manager: I think so too , it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment . I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh , hey Roo uh {gap} . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well , I tried once , but that was not allowed . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} So um {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , but but si uh w w w {gap} {disfmarker} when taken in account the the situation , uh I think we performed pretty well . industrial designer: I think so too . project manager: Yeah . Um user interface: Yeah . project manager: the means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen . Did you like 'em ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Uh . The digital pen was okay , but SMARTboard was really bad . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Because of the response industrial designer: It {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} project manager: or {disfmarker} user interface: Response industrial designer: The response is very slow user interface: and {disfmarker} industrial designer: and the possibilities are very limited . It's not accurate . project manager: Okay . Uh {disfmarker} user interface: Uh it it has {disfmarker} yeah . Yeah , it's not accurate . The p the pointing of the pen is not um the place where it it writes its {disfmarker} um uh where it uh {disfmarker} marketing: Draws . user interface: Yeah , where it draws . It's uh {disfmarker} the drawing on on the b on the board is {gap} r right from the pen . project manager: Okay , so user interface: So uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: it it had to be um better aligned , or what's the word ? user interface: You to take in account that your {disfmarker} you m project manager: Uh yeah . user interface: yeah uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Maybe it's {disfmarker} it needs to be calibrateds . user interface: It's too slow {disfmarker} project manager: It it was calibrated just before this meeting . Uh the one before , the third meeting . industrial designer: It is ? project manager: So uh it's not the calibration , industrial designer: Okay . project manager: it's the thing itself , I think . user interface: Hmm . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Uh Ruud , w uh did you use the pen a lot ? Or not at all ? marketing: No . project manager: Not at all . marketing: Not really . project manager: Okay . I thought it was quite a handy uh thing , industrial designer: I I think so too . project manager: although I would like to see um O_C_R_ . user interface: Yep . industrial designer: Yes . Yes . user interface: If it has O_C_R_ {vocalsound} , uh I think uh I would use , but uh I I just uh took notes for myself and and and that's it . project manager: Yeah . user interface: It w it w yeah .

No . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} can't say much about it . project manager: I missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops . I think that would be very easy if you could say okay , I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes . marketing: No , or the other way around . project manager: Or the other way around , that you could show {disfmarker} but m industrial designer: Yes , yes . user interface: But y you can {disfmarker} industrial designer: That's quite what PowerPoint does . marketing: Yeah . project manager: I know . user interface: if you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder . project manager: I know , but {disfmarker} user interface: So it's almost {disfmarker} project manager: I know , but we couldn't use that feature , user interface: yeah . project manager: so I missed it . user interface: Yep . project manager: We weren't able to do that .
