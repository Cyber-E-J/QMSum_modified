user interface: .. . project manager: Okay . So , this is uh first meeting of this design project . Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you . user interface: Mm , yeah . project manager: Maybe not . Anyway , user interface: I didn't receive it yet {vocalsound} . project manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . Then the main purpose is to {disfmarker} so that we get to know each other a little bit more . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss {disfmarker} come up with some preliminary ideas about it . And then that's it . So we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} so sh project manager: S so any any questions ? industrial designer: {gap} {vocalsound} {gap} . project manager: Is i {gap} not at this point . user interface: Not at this point . project manager: So this is our project . What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . There's the functional design of the the remote control . We're going {disfmarker} the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . Um and then the detailed design will come after that . We'll pull it all together . industrial designer: I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ? project manager: I think it {disfmarker} th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be {disfmarker} we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control industrial designer: Right . project manager: and what what specific things it it has to do industrial designer: {gap} project manager: but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the {disfmarker} how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . industrial designer: How how it will be done . So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the {disfmarker} it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? project manager: Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then industrial designer: Okay . project manager: {disfmarker} yeah . Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for {vocalsound} for the project , specifically the whiteboard . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Why are you looking at me ? user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Would you like to go first ? {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Do I have a choice ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere . project manager: Oh , yeah , marketing: Right , okay . project manager: p put them in pockets . marketing: Cool . Okay . project manager: You don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time . marketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: so um {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: It's got no eyes . marketing: Oh , good point . Ah , the eyes always ruin it . Right . Okay , what do {gap} it's eyes like ? Okay , cool . Um this is a rabbit . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} I thought it might be a cat . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit . user interface: Yeah now I now I understand now , yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah I can see by the ears . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Okay , right , it's a fluffy rabbit , blue . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Rabbits don't come in blue but you know . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Um okay and I like it because it's small {vocalsound} and it's fluffy . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {gap} project manager: Mm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Ah . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Okay ? industrial designer: Mm . project manager: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ? marketing: I am the um {disfmarker} I need my notebook , mm ooh {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: top banana . Thank you . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert {vocalsound} um so like I'm gonna be doing the {disfmarker} apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything {disfmarker} the user g requirements specification of the functional design , um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . Okay . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: um so yeah . industrial designer: 'Kay . project manager: And more about yourself , you're from ? marketing: Um I'm from Leicester , project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: um second year . Um what else do you want to know ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: I like sports {vocalsound} um yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: um {vocalsound} and uh {disfmarker} project manager: But not with rabbits . {vocalsound} marketing: not with rabbits , no no . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: And vets , I like vets as well . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} And yeah um and I like cocktails , especially pink ones . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Cool . marketing: Okay ? Cool . {vocalsound} project manager: Excellent , to match the rabbit . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . Um so my name is Maarika . Where's the pen ? Okay . project manager: There's a {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off . user interface: Yeah , well , or I can make it smaller . {vocalsound} Uh so um um I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m I mean I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very um {vocalsound} familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have {disfmarker} shouldn't have said it beforehand but industrial designer: Mm . user interface: mm {vocalsound} hmm . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Um well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay um . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} That's not bad at all . project manager: Ah it looks like a dog . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yep . marketing: Is a bit more impressive than my rabbit . user interface: Okay . marketing: I think it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , maybe it has some colourful patches , yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} {gap} the other legs are on the other side . user interface: Um yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . Mm , well that's compared to some other animals like cats . Um they're really much more fun because they are not so independent . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Um yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . Um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Uh I hope to be loyal to the project industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: and not to n not to um let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , {vocalsound} yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: And where where are you from ? user interface: I'm from Estonia project manager: Estonia . user interface: uh , yep . Um so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles , industrial designer: {gap} . user interface: um so um in the different um {vocalsound} stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for um for {vocalsound} yeah , designing the technical functions of the um {vocalsound} um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept and then in the last um stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . industrial designer: {gap} . user interface: {vocalsound} Okay , that's it . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Thank you . Okay {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} I'll do some {disfmarker} I'll rub the features project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: and let the drawing stay . {vocalsound} 'Kay um my name is Gaurav . Um {vocalsound} my favourite animal {disfmarker} one of my favourite animals is a cow . I've got no idea how to draw a cow . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Good luck . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Uh this is going to be {disfmarker} marketing: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs industrial designer: Yeah , that'll do . marketing: and then just some horns . industrial designer: Okay , so let let me draw the body first . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Mm . industrial designer: Big , round body , really skinny legs {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: and they've got a long tail marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: and a long face . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} It's eating . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: It looks like Eeyore . {vocalsound} industrial designer: And there is some grass there . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So this is what I like about {vocalsound} cows {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Horns , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , marketing: draw some horns . {vocalsound} industrial designer: they do not disturb anybody um marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: they're kind of Buddhist in a way . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So yeah , I like cows . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design , what are the various components of it and um finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part . Um the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other . Um I'm from India . Uh I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . {vocalsound} Yeah . Thank you . project manager: Excellent . user interface: {vocalsound} Thanks . project manager: Right , now now it's my turn obviously . {vocalsound} industrial designer: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , here's a space . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} It looks very very cute . project manager: Yeah , I like the cow . industrial designer: {gap} project manager: I'm Jen . user interface: Yeah . Mm-hmm . project manager: Um I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: I like {disfmarker} Mm . marketing: Is that a lizard ? industrial designer: No way . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Hmm . user interface: Wow . project manager: It's a gecko . industrial designer: Ah okay . user interface: Ah , a gecko , okay . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Is there a difference ? user interface: Is {disfmarker} a ar are they also like lizards or are they {disfmarker} project manager: They're {disfmarker} Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard . user interface: yeah , they are project manager: And I I like geckos user interface: {disfmarker} mm-hmm . project manager: because they remind me of warm places {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh-huh . project manager: and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house user interface: Ah . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: I hope you don't like snakes , do you ? project manager: I don't like snakes . I come from Australia user interface: Okay . {vocalsound} project manager: and we have nasty snakes . That's where I'm from , Australia . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today industrial designer: Mm . project manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . user interface: Wonderful . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: Thank you . project manager: {vocalsound} So , let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation . So , I've just thought {disfmarker} marketing: If you right click on it you can {disfmarker} project manager: yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally {vocalsound} as {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: there we go . Okay , so this is the um overall budget for our project . We've got {disfmarker} um we're planning to sell these remote controls for {disfmarker} let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes . Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each . Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros . And that's selling them on the international market , not just in the U_K_ . Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing . Okay . Hmm . This is {disfmarker} let me just skip ahead to see {disfmarker} that's the last thing , okay . We've only got a couple of minutes . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ? user interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have {disfmarker} w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . project manager: Mm-hmm . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that {vocalsound} are out of the ordinary . industrial designer: {vocalsound} I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was {disfmarker} that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . project manager: Something something new . marketing: Yeah , I was looking at the website , industrial designer: Mm . marketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . industrial designer: Alright . project manager: Uh-huh . marketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly {disfmarker} I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ? project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Okay . project manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: But what do most people do ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , marketing: Sometimes they play a movie . industrial designer: but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah . marketing: Yeah , so project manager: Yeah . marketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , project manager: So , no . marketing: maybe to do {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yep . project manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: And then use the {disfmarker} user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm . marketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . {vocalsound} project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Hmm . project manager: Excellent . marketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing project manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep . marketing: um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: {gap} project manager: Great . Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ? industrial designer: Mm . {vocalsound} Uh we can aim for {disfmarker} I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . Um {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems industrial designer: Yeah . A big learning curve , yeah . user interface: with l {vocalsound} learning , yeah , yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a {disfmarker} project manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access industrial designer: yeah . user interface: Hm-hmm . project manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . Um {vocalsound} we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're {disfmarker} you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design , industrial designer: {vocalsound} Alright . project manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification , marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: like you said at the start . Okay ? Thanks for that . user interface: Okay . {vocalsound} Thank you . project manager: Uh I'll see you in half an hour . industrial designer: {vocalsound} . user interface: {vocalsound} See you . project manager: Carry the laptops back again . industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: Do we need to unplug things ? Probably .
