project manager: Welcome back . user interface: Hello . marketing: Hello . project manager: Uh let me see . user interface: There's one of mine . project manager: Okay . Roo , welcome back . user interface: Hello , Flores . project manager: The waiting is for Sebastian . user interface: {gap} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: There he is . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . {vocalsound} I opened uh the C_D_ ROM box uh guys . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager: Uh no . You can't , industrial designer: Okay . {vocalsound} project manager: sorry . user interface: So just cancel it . industrial designer: {gap} Well , during my work I have no time either . project manager: {vocalsound} Well , industrial designer: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: this is life . {vocalsound} Sorry uh , Roo . user interface: Yeah , I opened the C_D_ ROM box . {vocalsound} Accidentally . project manager: Okay . Okay . People , welcome back with the second meeting . user interface: But it's alright . project manager: {vocalsound} Um for now on the schedule are a few points . Uh first of all the opening , which we are doing now . Um second , I received um some new project requirements . I'm not sure if you received them as well , um but I will tell you about it . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Um then um the three of you uh prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . project manager: Roo ? user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Ruud ? marketing: Almost . {vocalsound} project manager: Almost , okay . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last . Um the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager: {vocalsound} Um we will figure that out . Ca {vocalsound} can you try to {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . marketing: Uh if it if it if it's wireless I could just uh put it in the {gap} . project manager: Yeah , w we will see . user interface: I don't think it's wireless here . project manager: Um {disfmarker} it is , yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: It is . user interface: Or it is . Yeah ? industrial designer: It is . user interface: Okay , great . marketing: Uh okay . project manager: Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind . Um {vocalsound} we have forty minutes . So it's now {disfmarker} Yep . Okay . Um the new project requirements , first of all , um we didn't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext . So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product . {vocalsound} It's a board decision . Um the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not uh f uh feasible , it's not uh w user interface: Yeah . project manager: uh uh {disfmarker} we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with . user interface: Time , yeah . project manager: Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty , {vocalsound} which is important for you , uh Ruud , and as well for uh Roo . Because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty . Um {vocalsound} then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product . user interface: Yes . project manager: Is that clear ? Any questions on these requirements ? No ? {vocalsound} Okay . Um the individual presentations , I th um Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start . project manager: Uh uh yeah . Okay , industrial designer: Yes . project manager: great . user interface: Um {disfmarker} Oh , how can I uh {disfmarker} Geez , and sli and show . Um {disfmarker} Just uh press it . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Uh yes . Alright . Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion . {vocalsound} Uh the method of the remote control is just {disfmarker} the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . project manager: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} Um but um {disfmarker} yeah . My personal preferences were ease of uh {disfmarker} the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh {disfmarker} it can be more trendy in in user design . But um your new goal f was for uh people than {disfmarker} less than forty years old . project manager: Uh-huh . user interface: So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so . But my {disfmarker} in {gap} my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay . Uh Ruud , did you get that ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , uh b uh most . project manager: Okay , so marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: the important thing here is {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic . marketing: Oh , user-friendly . project manager: In the market , yeah . user interface: Yeah , what what does the market want ? I I don't know . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all uh {disfmarker} user interface: Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control . project manager: Yeah . Okay . Sebastian . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Excuse me . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Scusi . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Um {disfmarker} Okay , it's still the right thing . Okay . Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . Can you see it ? project manager: No , it's not visible . industrial designer: No ? Well {disfmarker} Um , there's a energy source here . {vocalsound} And um basically there {disfmarker} it's connected to three things . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . That's basically the idea . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . {vocalsound} Okay . Um what have I found . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . That's all . It's cased together , nothing more than that . {vocalsound} It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed . industrial designer: yes . In the {disfmarker} and it's a little more {disfmarker} a little bit more fancy also . So maybe we should consider that . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . Okay . industrial designer: Okay . I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . Um basically this is all there is . There's just one chip . There are a few buttons connected . Uh the buttons are lit . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . {vocalsound} So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment . project manager: So it's fairly easy . industrial designer: There's nothing more to it . It's fairly easy . It's been done many times before , project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} Succeed in it also . industrial designer: and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , industrial designer: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so uh project manager: good . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set . So I think that uh should be clear . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them . {vocalsound} Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: {vocalsound} And what's the um {disfmarker} industrial designer: I think our uh users will really uh will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or {disfmarker} industrial designer: No , they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: So we can use them . So that's no problem . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be uh in our {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive , but by uh um um making {disfmarker} user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . marketing: Well you could only lit uh the buttons {disfmarker} the buttons that are used most . So , the channel switching . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . marketing: Or {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . user interface: But I think {disfmarker} industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: Hmm , true . {vocalsound} user interface: and not for {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes . Well , it's not one light , it {disfmarker} there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . user interface: Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think . industrial designer: No no no , no . That's right , that's right . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} well , this uh should be it . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Um have a think about it . project manager: Yeah . Okay , Ruud . marketing: Oh , mine is already outdated . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product . marketing: {vocalsound} Since uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: So any income is welcome . {vocalsound} Input . marketing: Okay , make {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units . Of {gap} {disfmarker} of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million . project manager: Okay . user interface: Could you step a little bit more to the right ? {vocalsound} Yeah , thank you . {vocalsound} marketing: But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . But uh since uh the requirements changed , that's uh not a good idea . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh well , skip this . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Well , it's {disfmarker} this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons . The buttons to zap are used the {disfmarker} about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . And the volume button's only four times . So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones . project manager: Okay . Well , that's interesting . marketing: Or {disfmarker} industrial designer: Or a find {disfmarker} a finding function , user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: you know . project manager: that's definitely interesting . industrial designer: That's quite a {disfmarker} yes . project manager: It uh it separates our product from others uh as well . user interface: Sound signal . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay , user interface: Yeah . project manager: go on . industrial designer: Yes . marketing: Well , I just said that . And uh {disfmarker} well , this obvious , and he also said it . project manager: Okay . So that's what the market tells us . marketing: Uh that's about it , yes . project manager: Yep . Okay . user interface: The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used . marketing: Uh mo uh zap buttons most . user interface: So {disfmarker} marketing: Volume , they are {gap} uh use a lot . But more than all the other buttons . So {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design {disfmarker} The perfect design for those {disfmarker} only those buttons . And first um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes . Yes , we should focus on that , I guess . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yep . industrial designer: Well , the technical uh {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} I think there are no technical difficulties . There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . So um I don't think we have any hiccups there . So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal . user interface: Yeah , the sound signal . Just one thing I'm just wondering , {vocalsound} the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a problem . Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yes . {vocalsound} Th that's a bit of {disfmarker} that's a problem . user interface: {vocalsound} Another device is not a solution . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually {disfmarker} project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be uh uh {disfmarker} project manager: like um turning on and off the the the lights . industrial designer: Oh yes . user interface: Yeah , but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it . industrial designer: Yes . Well , there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already . Um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound , and your uh remote controls then start to beep . project manager: Reports rep respend response to it . industrial designer: And um {disfmarker} user interface: just like uh the phones Yeah , industrial designer: Yes . Yes , that's it . Yes , same thing . user interface: the {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: But uh th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all uh uh buttons . Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: No , so we we should use something else . marketing: And you {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home um {disfmarker} user interface: But I believe you will have an {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , and usually {disfmarker} industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want {gap} to make so it's {gap} {disfmarker} is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about {disfmarker} project manager: So what about the clapping technique ? Um because you se user interface: I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us . industrial designer: {vocalsound} It's quite complicated . Well , it's quite complicated . Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds . marketing: {vocalsound} And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . Yeah . industrial designer: which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . marketing: So if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep . project manager: Yeah , that's true . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ . Just a little antenna or uh something . industrial designer: so we don't want that . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Maybe we can {disfmarker} Something like that . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily {disfmarker} user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the {disfmarker} their remote . industrial designer: Well , I don't think uh {gap} . user interface: Uh that's just uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh {gap} . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: so w we should use have {disfmarker} uh we should use something like that . You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . user interface: {gap} just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility . industrial designer: Yes , something like that . But that will be very costly , I think . project manager: Yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . industrial designer: So that's not a good idea . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution , industrial designer: Mm-hmm . I will . user interface: Yeah . project manager: because that's his {disfmarker} his field of expertise . industrial designer: Yes . Yes . But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: um and it will become more costly also . project manager: Yep . industrial designer: Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used . And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} user interface: It will be an {disfmarker} a unique feature of our remote control . project manager: It's a different {disfmarker} exactly . It's an uni an unique feature , marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and {disfmarker} probably more i interesting than uh than the lights . user interface: And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um {vocalsound} an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . project manager: Yeah . user interface: What should we choose in in design ? project manager: Yeah . Well , um according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often . user interface: Well , the extra functions . project manager: So {disfmarker} marketing: I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here . project manager: Okay . marketing: Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most {disfmarker} the second-most used function . user interface: Used option . project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh well {disfmarker} yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important . project manager: Yeah . Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext . marketing: So {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . project manager: Well , we skip that . marketing: So {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . user interface: Well , so it just th the basic functions . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff . industrial designer: No , no . project manager: No . user interface: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Nope . industrial designer: So that's out of the question . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} project manager: Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one . industrial designer: I think also . Yes . Well , project manager: No . user interface: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and {disfmarker} project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ? Uh do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple {disfmarker} marketing: Uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh then they uh might , project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: 'cause young people uh like new features . project manager: Mm yeah . marketing: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , that's right . project manager: Okay , so this is is kind of uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm . user interface: Uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . industrial designer: Okay . Well , is it {disfmarker} maybe there's another possibility . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the {disfmarker} make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless {disfmarker} project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual uh {disfmarker} I mean if you have few buttons , no display , um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh industrial designer: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Ok like that . Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . I don't know if if it's user-friendly . That's your field of expertise . project manager: But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . {vocalsound} project manager: Because we do not implement uh a user history . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . There's {disfmarker} no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um {disfmarker} industrial designer: W Mm-hmm . Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . Something like that . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button . project manager: Yeah . Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions . industrial designer: Yes . user interface: But does it {disfmarker} uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . user interface: should we just use a {disfmarker} Um it's already uh {disfmarker} oh , we have a blank . Oh . industrial designer: yeah , something like that . Oh user interface: It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what {disfmarker} which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick . industrial designer: It's not really a stick , but {disfmarker} Yes . Yes . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: or uh industrial designer: Yes , yes . user interface: just a round uh button should be the trick , I think . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: And {disfmarker} Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think . marketing: A younger uh {disfmarker} Huh . industrial designer: But you're the marketing man . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . user interface: Geez . Well , volume and something uh like that . {vocalsound} project manager: Uh-huh . {vocalsound} user interface: The programme up and down . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , yeah . user interface: And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want . industrial designer: Okay , that's good . project manager: Okay , but w we still {vocalsound} we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . user interface: But I think our our next step to look at is just that . So I don't think it's {disfmarker} um we have something to do . Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have {disfmarker} has the information to discuss about that , I think . project manager: Um well , for {disfmarker} we do have to uh decide this this meeting . Yeah . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to um have the uh the user function {disfmarker} uh the functions decided and um {vocalsound} uh our target audience . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay . user interface: but teletext is so uh is just scrapped . 'Kay , industrial designer: Okay . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager: Um well , I do not want a full uh {disfmarker} it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting . industrial designer: Okay . Okay . user interface: The ten digits . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Well , for example , that that's what we should think about . {gap} l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but {disfmarker} user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change industrial designer: Mm-hmm . Yes . project manager: Yeah . A bit of a split mode . industrial designer: Change . project manager: Uh l like {disfmarker} Yeah . user interface: {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: Yes , yes . project manager: Dual channel watch . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Okay , well um user interface: Yeah . project manager: m maybe I should write that down . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: you're the secretary . {vocalsound} project manager: Uh Ruud , um what's your last name ? marketing: Mielsen . project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last uh {disfmarker} Mielsen . Right . Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm okay , user interface: Alright . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , that's that's {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: if you want to do it , Sebastian . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Sure . {vocalsound} {gap} . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so so um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} {gap} {disfmarker} project manager: Volume . Programme . Uh dual channel . Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes , that's important . project manager: And and do we want um the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: I'm not so sure . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Well , that's complicated , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think {disfmarker} but you should uh shou you should know that . If it were so . user interface: I wouldn't buy it personally . A remote control without the ten digits . industrial designer: Okay , user interface: Uh and I think the most {disfmarker} industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . {vocalsound} user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're {disfmarker} when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well {disfmarker} user interface: but {disfmarker} industrial designer: But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker} you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough . project manager: But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels . marketing: But {disfmarker} user interface: Yep . The older people only use five of them . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we {disfmarker} And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . project manager: Often . industrial designer: No , you're probably right . marketing: So {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the {disfmarker} industrial designer: The design . user interface: On the design . industrial designer: Okay . Well , y then there should be {disfmarker} should done {disfmarker} be done something specific with it . marketing: Well {disfmarker} project manager: You c {vocalsound} you can d make them very fancy marketing: And {disfmarker} project manager: by um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: So I'm I'm {disfmarker} I do not agree {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by {disfmarker} uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing . project manager: Exactly , exactly . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh for {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: And it's very easy uh to find your remote control . project manager: To find {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} If if we would um drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we uh {disfmarker} project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . Okay , okay . marketing: Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . So then we should implement such a but project manager: Yeah . But we do focus on younger people . We d it it's a board uh decision . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Yes . industrial designer: Well . I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that . user interface: So project manager: Okay . user interface: we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition . industrial designer: Yes . Well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button {disfmarker} uh remote control function . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: So that's that's a big advantage , I think . project manager: Okay , g good . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . industrial designer: There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this . Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult . So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: But maybe can {disfmarker} we we can think something smart about it . project manager: Yep . industrial designer: There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But {disfmarker} But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: M {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Twelve dollar fifty . {vocalsound} project manager: Because it seems like a very {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Maybe , maybe not . marketing: And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be uh a big problem . industrial designer: I'll have to find that out . Yes . So {disfmarker} No , that's very cheap . marketing: 'Cause when {disfmarker} project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's {disfmarker} Oh , it's very cheap . That's no problem . It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts . project manager: I know , b uh but there should be an adapter as well . industrial designer: It's {disfmarker} Yes , but they're they're mass production . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: They're very cheap . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: So it will cost us p practically nothing . project manager: Okay . We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . Um {vocalsound} I would like to hear um {disfmarker} maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about , yeah , but that are important . Uh Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data . Uh are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing: Um I think we dealt with the most important information . Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh want to sell to . So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . marketing: But with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too . So {disfmarker} I don't think that's a big problem project manager: Okay . Okay , so industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh {disfmarker} Profitable . We we {disfmarker} yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people . marketing: Yes . Yeah , profitable . industrial designer: Profitable . project manager: Okay . marketing: Yes . project manager: O okay . {vocalsound} Um Roo . {gap} {disfmarker} Nothing to add . user interface: I have nothing uh nothing to add , I think . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer: Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities . Um project manager: Yeah ? Great . industrial designer: so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . So on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . So that's one {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} those are the choices we have to make . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that {disfmarker} these kinds of things . project manager: Mm-hmm . Yeah . industrial designer: Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience . Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , which uh I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving . project manager: Yep . industrial designer: Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not {disfmarker} do not implement these buttons . {vocalsound} If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board {disfmarker} industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that {disfmarker} we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: And this even uh makes it more cheapy . user interface: But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: The board . user interface: The circuit board . industrial designer: The circuit board . user interface: The fewer buttons you can use on it . project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . project manager: yeah . user interface: Yeah , okay . project manager: It's the other way around , yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip . So that's that's another advantage . project manager: It shouldn't be a big issue . user interface: Well it {disfmarker} then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh {disfmarker} especially for the voice recognition . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} Yes , because I don't know {disfmarker} Yes . I d I really don't know . So {disfmarker} user interface: No . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: It can be costly . Maybe not . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f uh determine the costs , I will have a look at it . Maybe you will get some information on that . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Um I'm not sure how how that {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will uh {vocalsound} have a lo uh look at it . {vocalsound} project manager: Yep . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , great . Um {vocalsound} well , I think we're qui quite done . user interface: We're done , I think . project manager: Um for now we will have the lunch break . industrial designer: How nice . project manager: Um I'm {disfmarker} don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . user interface: Me neither . project manager: Um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , uh and I'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it . Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder . If you want to look at it um well , just do . Um {vocalsound} the Interface Designer , um I would like to {disfmarker} the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept . user interface: Interface {disfmarker} industrial . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} I'm sorry , yeah , I'm sorry . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: User Interface Designer , uh Roo , I would like to see the user interface c uh concept . industrial designer: Well , we understand . {vocalsound} project manager: And um user interface: Uh the only problem is it {disfmarker} that it depends on the divisions {disfmarker} the decis uh decisions Sebastian makes . About the voice recognition . industrial designer: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well {disfmarker} project manager: that's w w what we concluded . It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . And um {vocalsound} um yeah , some some fancy lights . industrial designer: Mm yes . user interface: Yeah . project manager: I think that's what we decided . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't {disfmarker} industrial designer: Or {disfmarker} project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated {disfmarker} industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's {disfmarker} of course it's user interface , but um i I was talking about really the design of the {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . Well um do we really have to decide now project manager: No . industrial designer: or can we decide next meeting ? project manager: We can decide the next meeting . Yep . industrial designer: Okay . Because I'll have some updated info on that uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . I guess all of you have i updated info . I'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching . user interface: Yep . project manager: And I'm sure the market will um uh {vocalsound} {gap} uh will change , adapt marketing: Hmm . user interface: Adapt . industrial designer: Adapt . marketing: Left . project manager: and um so marketing: Hmm . project manager: we will see that . Um yeah , that's it for now . user interface: That's it . project manager: Any other questions user interface: 'Kay . project manager: or can we have the lunch ? industrial designer: We can have the lunch . project manager: Yeah , okay . marketing: Yeah . user interface: I'll take the lunch . project manager: Good .
