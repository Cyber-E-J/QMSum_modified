project manager: Uh fourth meeting . {vocalsound} user interface: We have to do what ? project manager: Some extra deciding . industrial designer: {vocalsound} W what ? Alri alright . We'll see . project manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} user interface: Oh . project manager: {gap} I'll show you the notes again . Very interesting . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Then um {disfmarker} I guess that's your bit ? I I didn't s see anything about it , marketing: Yeah . project manager: so {vocalsound} I already uh thought you uh you were {gap} to do that . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: So the you're uh {gap} . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Yeah , that's important too . Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: And then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it . user interface: {vocalsound} Bit late . {vocalsound} project manager: Because uh well we'll see about the costs . Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close . industrial designer: Alright . project manager: Well the finance uh we'll do later , so um firstly uh {vocalsound} I'll show you the notes . {vocalsound} I don't think it's very interesting . {vocalsound} user interface: I think it is . project manager: Oh nei . Uh no . {vocalsound} Alright . This is copy paste . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: From me of course , yeah . project manager: Of course . You had some very strange layout . industrial designer: Well from us all , yeah , from all of us . Yeah . {vocalsound} It's a nice chorus , yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Well um {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: We ge we went through the agenda , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . And uh I summarised what you said to us . So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again . industrial designer: Repeat it yeah . Alright . project manager: So uh {disfmarker} This is what we decided . It's also copy paste from what we made together . So we still know that . marketing: Okay . project manager: And then uh we can we can uh use the time better . Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us . industrial designer: Alright , we both uh will ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Or one of us will ? user interface: {vocalsound} Alright . industrial designer: Uh {disfmarker} user interface: No you go and I'll uh supplement you . industrial designer: Alright . If I make mistakes uh you'll uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Correct . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Right . Uh well this is our design . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we'll begin uh with the front . We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th So there's this part um {vocalsound} which is made of hard plastic , the front . And uh we're we're using different colours . Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . {vocalsound} Um then we have uh the lower part {vocalsound} of the of the device . Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it's also titanium . You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner , project manager: Mm . industrial designer: uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part . user interface: Yeah , it's a double R_ , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah ? user interface: It's a double R_ . industrial designer: It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo {disfmarker} user interface: But {vocalsound} it's very difficult to to draw that in {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: Yeah , alright . industrial designer: Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there . project manager: Okay . Yeah . industrial designer: Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . Then we have the buttons . Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round {disfmarker} I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons . user interface: Oval yeah . project manager: Alright . industrial designer: So {gap} uh oval , n those are here . And then we have the m The m user interface: Channel up and volume ? industrial designer: Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh {vocalsound} uh square buttons . And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . We have the Okay button . Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: And then we've here the Menu button and the {disfmarker} project manager: Alright . user interface: Menu for the L_C_D_ screen . industrial designer: And the video button . The {disfmarker} project manager: So {disfmarker} marketing: Mm right . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen . project manager: 'Kay . industrial designer: Uh this is what we made of it . You can make uh suggestions uh if you want . project manager: Well if I look at it , the side the side view {disfmarker} user interface: Well , at the back {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and then you can add suggestions . project manager: Oh yeah alright . Yeah {gap} . industrial designer: Maybe I I don't want to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't want to suppress you but n I'll uh finish this uh quick . project manager: {gap} industrial designer: Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front ? user interface: No the back . With the logo and our uh l uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah the back . Yeah . {vocalsound} We thought about {disfmarker} Yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium . {vocalsound} And we thought about the logo big in the middle . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Just so again the double R_ . We have then the logo on front and on the back . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Maybe that's too much project manager: Okay . industrial designer: but you have to say uh say that if you think that way . user interface: No I don't think {disfmarker} And the {disfmarker} industrial designer: And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: That's basically what we were thinking about , project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: and {disfmarker} project manager: W user interface: And about the side view um {disfmarker} This the front won't be as thick , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh {disfmarker} project manager: Well I see , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: Oh and uh before I forget . Yeah the the voice , of course , project manager: Well . Yeah I see it . industrial designer: the voice recorder is uh at the bottom . project manager: Yes . industrial designer: And you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: When I look at uh when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand , it's terrible . user interface: Well , it won't be visible . Mm ? project manager: If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . But {disfmarker} industrial designer: Why ? {vocalsound} Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand , {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: mean uh the the the the {disfmarker} project manager: Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands . marketing: Yeah , I agree . user interface: {gap} If y {vocalsound} If you handle a remote , you you usually don't have your hand straight like this . industrial designer: {vocalsound} In the middle in the {disfmarker} user interface: You you have it a bit uh {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: It depends on the size . If it's kinda small , this is is great . But if it's it's larger , then you want to grab it . project manager: And how large is it ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , that's the question . industrial designer: That's the question . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh well {disfmarker} Yeah . H What do you suggest I mean we do ? {gap} This was Mike's prototype , project manager: Well uh {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: and y you seemed to agreed on it . project manager: Well the sides I haven't seen yet , uh {gap} ? industrial designer: But now you have a totally different {gap} . user interface: Well , they lay there all the time . industrial designer: The size ? Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean {disfmarker} project manager: They the the the the the side view , industrial designer: Side ? Uh oh the side ? project manager: we didn't uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: W we we he drew the s the side , user interface: Yeah yeah . industrial designer: but you d you weren't paying attention as usual . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well any case , we'll discuss it now . Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea {gap} . marketing: Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it . project manager: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: But you you hold it like this . user interface: Yeah you you don't you don't grab it , industrial designer: You're not holding it like this or something . user interface: you you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: You , yeah , y How do you call it ? Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well y y y you don't have it like this . project manager: No no no . industrial designer: You have it more like this . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {gap} You you you're using buttons this way , or if you're right-handed , this way . marketing: Like you're holding your telephone . project manager: Yep . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So you {disfmarker} Yeah . So {disfmarker} marketing: Because if you have a screen on it , you wanna look at your screen . user interface: Hmm . That way , it it falls into your hand . I think . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah well {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . industrial designer: And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher , marketing: Yeah , I agree on this . industrial designer: so {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: No , I don't think so . That's not uh the point {disfmarker} user interface: No but but {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well the the {disfmarker} Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree project manager: Yeah well user interface: and only Nils {disfmarker} project manager: uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it . user interface: But you're the Project Manager , you can make the hard decisions . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: Yes . So uh I c I c industrial designer: If necessary . project manager: Well , we'll we we'll do it like this . industrial designer: But uh are d Can you live with it ? Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Alright , if you think that that's the way it should {gap} {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah ? industrial designer: Y Yeah , y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable . project manager: No {disfmarker} No , industrial designer: But do you project manager: when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} In the market uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess . I think . project manager: No not totally . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Not totally , well {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} For me , I I wouldn't buy it . Let's say it like that . industrial designer: Yeah but of course y you are also human . We have to take uh {vocalsound} every everyone into account . So {disfmarker} project manager: No {gap} {disfmarker} marketing: And you might be uh {disfmarker} You might be target customer . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yes but {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well uh who who else thinks like you ? user interface: Mm . industrial designer: We don't know . project manager: Yeah , we don't know , industrial designer: Maybe a thousand people , project manager: but that's uh that's that's that's more market research . industrial designer: or a million people . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: So {vocalsound} let it be like this at uh at this moment . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Let it be . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay ? industrial designer: Alright . So that's that . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh any other suggestions ? project manager: No , I think it's great . marketing: Yeah . user interface: But what about the redesigning ? project manager: {vocalsound} Comes to that later . user interface: Okay . {vocalsound} project manager: Um you . Uh c You can uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Walter . {vocalsound} You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this ? user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} You're very personal again . marketing: {vocalsound} Alright . Great . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: That's more useful than just {vocalsound} speaking . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well , this is just a short intro . project manager: Yes . marketing: I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: So I made a {disfmarker} I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly . Well , I put some questions in a Word file . See if I can find them . Uh uh uh uh mm . project manager: 'Kay . marketing: Well {disfmarker} user interface: Hmm . marketing: I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation , so uh I don't have to explain it . Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ? Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly . Seventy five percent of them . So what do we think ? industrial designer: Well d we designed it , so of course we are very {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . project manager: Yeah , we're we're not quite uh objective about this . marketing: Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: Well we designed it to be good-looking . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: No , I know , but {vocalsound} I have to uh evaluate it . So I have to take this questionnaire . project manager: To the customers ? industrial designer: So and we ha we have answer now ? project manager: To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ? industrial designer: Yeah . {gap} marketing: Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah , but I can't can s project manager: Nei . Oh no . I know , I know , I know . user interface: Hmm . project manager: But um {disfmarker} Well {vocalsound} we can go , uh because of the time , uh pretty quick through this . Uh do we find it good-looking ? Well we think so . Uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . We designed it to be good-looking , so {disfmarker} industrial designer: I {disfmarker} Yeah , I think it {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , but uh , you know {disfmarker} We dis we di {vocalsound} we designed it to be perfect . project manager: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: So {vocalsound} {disfmarker} But we have to be critic critical about it . And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end . So we {vocalsound} we know where we stand . project manager: Well , one . industrial designer: {gap} marketing: 'Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten . project manager: Well so it's point four . Easy to find t industrial designer: Well l well let's start with the beginning , just one by one . {vocalsound} marketing: Right , so {disfmarker} Right . Uh is it good-looking ? industrial designer: Well , I guess uh I think uh {vocalsound} it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course , uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything . {gap} project manager: Two . {vocalsound} industrial designer: That was our target audience of course . But it's also not completely um {vocalsound} uh u unacceptable for older people I guess . Uh it's it's not f a device that {disfmarker} marketing: The titanium might be uh f for older people . industrial designer: Yeah , that's that's uh for older people , it's it's more that classical look . So {disfmarker} marketing: It you put uh put a black front on it or something . user interface: Hmm . industrial designer: Uh no . {vocalsound} I think {disfmarker} Yeah they like black of course , but I think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also {disfmarker} Uh I think it's also good for them , so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people . So I think it's very good-looking marketing: Right . industrial designer: and not only for youth uh young people . user interface: I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long , because I don't know how how many points there are but uh {disfmarker} project manager: No . I totally agree . marketing: Right . industrial designer: Yeah , the fourteen yeah . project manager: We we have to get get on , go through this . marketing: Right , a number please . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Is it easy to t change channels ? Yeah well I think so . marketing: So the last one is seven . user interface: Um , no it's uh {disfmarker} marketing: Easy to change channels ? project manager: No , not false . It's one . marketing: Oh , sorry . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , right . project manager: Well uh two ? Y Well we have to go through it {gap} . marketing: Change channels ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made . Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Right . industrial designer: So I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . You {disfmarker} How can you make it any easier ? {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} With two huge buttons . marketing: The power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ? project manager: Yep . industrial designer: Yeah , huge is a {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: Two . marketing: Two ? Alright . The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ? project manager: Well , no . We didn't implement anything about that . {gap} industrial designer: D we d we don't we don't have uh that s user interface: Well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something , project manager: {vocalsound} Well six then . {vocalsound} user interface: because of the colour . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . Six ? Right . industrial designer: Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so , project manager: Are the functions easy to learn ? industrial designer: but um um {disfmarker} project manager: Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an {disfmarker} user interface: {gap} We have so few functions , so {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: Yeah , I agree . project manager: And the device R_S_I_ sensitive ? user interface: Well , I should {disfmarker} I think two , project manager: Yeah . user interface: because {vocalsound} the voice recorder is n not self learning . {vocalsound} project manager: Ah . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: {gap} marketing: Alright . Two ? industrial designer: Mm ? project manager: Yeah , but just do some {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} We we {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} I th I th I think this is too time consuming . industrial designer: Are we take too much time ? project manager: Uh not not towards you , marketing: Yeah , I agree . project manager: but towards this all . marketing: No . project manager: Th this is {gap} {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: We you have to put it to the customers . marketing: Right , R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ? {vocalsound} R_S_I_ sensitive ? project manager: Uh well well a bit , so four . marketing: Four . Um {disfmarker} project manager: Yes . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , very much . One . project manager: One . And features included also one . And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} One . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking . Uh we still think so . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Device fancy feeling . industrial designer: And I think fancy-feeling too , project manager: Yeah , cool man . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: because of the titanium back . Yeah . marketing: Right . project manager: Are there enough technology ? Yeah well also we have two . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's great . project manager: Is the device easy to use ? user interface: The {disfmarker} project manager: Yes we have {vocalsound} not many buttons . industrial designer: So well maybe two project manager: Two , three . user interface: Two {vocalsound} two . industrial designer: because of the voice recorder . marketing: Well , with the uh {disfmarker} Three . project manager: Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ? user interface: T industrial designer: F project manager: Well in our covers , in our fronts . user interface: Yeah . project manager: So yes , one . industrial designer: Yeah . One or two . Yeah . user interface: One or two , another two . marketing: Nah f four I think . industrial designer: Four ? marketing: {vocalsound} If you look at this {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well , it doesn't really resemble any fruit , uh that's true . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course . marketing: No . project manager: Oh okay . Okay {gap} . user interface: Well three . marketing: Three , alright . industrial designer: And you can also have {gap} front with uh with fruit on it . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , that's true . project manager: Is the material attractive ? marketing: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Mm . Yeah . project manager: Well the titanium is strong , and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft . So I would say at least two . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Right . project manager: Okay . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} Yeah . user interface: This is the last meeting ? project manager: Yes , but we we have to design much more , user interface: Yeah . marketing: The average will uh come later . project manager: because there was some irritating account manager coming to me . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: I knew things uh were going uh too smoothly . project manager: Oh . Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: There had to be some kind of trouble along the way . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Yes . Well , look at the costs at this point . industrial designer: My god . project manager: I had to fit it in . marketing: It has to go to twelve , right ? project manager: I twelve and a half . marketing: Twelve and a half . project manager: So {disfmarker} Well what costs a lot ? The sample spea costs four . industrial designer: The what ? project manager: The sample speaker , industrial designer: The {disfmarker} marketing: Out . project manager: the s sensor . marketing: That's easy . Kick it out . project manager: Kick it out . user interface: The what ? project manager: We have to go to twelve and a half . marketing: Yeah . The speaker . project manager: The speaker costs far , by far the most . user interface: Oh . industrial designer: Yeah w tha that's uh that's a bit an optional option . marketing: That's some wrong info , man . {vocalsound} project manager: It it isn't worth it . industrial designer: No . No , d th No . marketing: No . project manager: We could make two different versions , one with and one without . marketing: It's uh {disfmarker} project manager: But for this {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: It's just extra . Kick it out . project manager: So , zero . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Then we go to fourteen point six . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually . marketing: What more ? industrial designer: No . marketing: {vocalsound} Batteries are uh quite {disfmarker} project manager: L_C_ three ? Yeah hand dynamo ? Y t come on , marketing: {vocalsound} Uh no , no no no . project manager: w a remote control has a battery . user interface: Um {disfmarker} industrial designer: N Uh well we have a bit of a problem I think . user interface: Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ? industrial designer: Because uh {disfmarker} project manager: Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said . industrial designer: {gap} the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . user interface: Yeah ? marketing: Hmm . user interface: Can't we do that with a regular chip ? industrial designer: No . user interface: Why not ? industrial designer: Because uh that uh y {vocalsound} project manager: Well what what's the difference between simple and regular ? industrial designer: because my information says it . project manager: What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ? industrial designer: Huh ? user interface: Yeah . Regular is normal . marketing: Yeah . project manager: And simple ? industrial designer: Uh well yeah I I read something about it , but {disfmarker} user interface: Simple . project manager: {vocalsound} Nothing . user interface: {vocalsound} Elementary . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Well {gap} ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , project manager: Your part . industrial designer: I I read something about it , but it wasn't very clear . I d I didn't in include it in my report . project manager: What happens if we do {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Single {disfmarker} Well you have to use a chip . So {disfmarker} Well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the L_C_D_ screen . project manager: How much do we win ? One . user interface: We we we {disfmarker} Why ? project manager: {gap} user interface: We have very little options furthermore , for the {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: But if you have a regular chip , you can't have the L_C_D_ screen . user interface: Uh well we have to put that in . marketing: Yeah , we need to have the {vocalsound} the L_C_D_ screen . industrial designer: That that's a fact . Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn't that that isn't there , marketing: No {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: because the the fronts they will buy it . The special colour . industrial designer: Yeah , but it's only one half . marketing: Yeah , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: Nah . industrial designer: Uh it d it doesn't {disfmarker} marketing: No , that's n It's not relevant . project manager: Yeah , user interface: Yeah , you must change the chip uh back . project manager: then you s then you only have one half left . user interface: You must change the chip back , Nils . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Uh yeah . industrial designer: But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen . marketing: No , {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Then the whole concept is uh industrial designer: Yeah , I know but that's what my information says . I di I didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun . {vocalsound} user interface: Hmm . {vocalsound} No {vocalsound} we oh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: You {disfmarker} You can make you can make it cheaper . industrial designer: You have to use it . marketing: But if you don't sell industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . user interface: You you we have an advanced chip-on-print , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: and we have an L_C_ display . I think that's a bit double . project manager: Yeah ? No , {vocalsound} user interface: Y we don't need both . project manager: the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display . industrial designer: For the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . Yeah . user interface: Says {gap} . project manager: Says , his {disfmarker} Uh that was in the second meeting , I think . industrial designer: Well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again ? Because we you have uncurved {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: Well I I did single curve to {disfmarker} Well you said s double curved , user interface: I ? project manager: uh he , user interface: {gap} ? project manager: because uh I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: We can also make it flat . industrial designer: Well {disfmarker} marketing: {gap} No industrial designer: But what what did what do n marketing: no no no . project manager: But {disfmarker} industrial designer: Sorry , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} What do they mean with the curves ? project manager: Curved ? industrial designer: Is th Is this a curve ? project manager: Yes , that's curved . industrial designer: One curve ? project manager: Yes . industrial designer: Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah . project manager: No , it's one curve . industrial designer: It's how you {disfmarker} It's how you look at it . user interface: {vocalsound} One curve . {vocalsound} project manager: One curve , simple . industrial designer: Well then we have a huge problem I think . marketing: {gap} industrial designer: W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half . project manager: We have a big financial problem . user interface: Well we make it more expensive to buy . project manager: Well , then we have two dollars less profit . Come on , if we if we if we make this fifty million , they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us , so uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {gap} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: If if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more . But {disfmarker} Because we we use a brand at the front and uh I dun at the back . If you have uh lots of uh marketing people might buy . industrial designer: But uh I {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah or we could replace it {disfmarker} marketing: If you if you make it cool to have {disfmarker} project manager: By the way , we also have this one . marketing: Oh , that's just great . project manager: Oh , costs nothing . That's nice . {vocalsound} marketing: Oh , alright . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing . project manager: Plastic is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yes , but I just got it . marketing: {gap} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well that's pretty uh l user interface: Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium , marketing: That is pretty stupid . {vocalsound} industrial designer: N not very practical . {vocalsound} Well {disfmarker} user interface: uh titanium-coloured plastic ? project manager: Who ? marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: You want to dump the titanium ? user interface: Yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper . project manager: And make all plastic , then we ha then we're there . industrial designer: {vocalsound} But I'm n I don't agree . user interface: But then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again . industrial designer: I think {disfmarker} project manager: Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy . user interface: Ah no no . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: It's not ugly looking . The looks remain the same . project manager: No , I don't think so . user interface: Well , I do think so . industrial designer: I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the {disfmarker} marketing: Y project manager: Yes . And the feel , user interface: {gap} feel . project manager: and th that it is strong , and {disfmarker} industrial designer: And also the the older people will like it because of that . And because i marketing: Yeah , I agree . industrial designer: Alright it's not our target audience , but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people . project manager: We still {vocalsound} we had to focus to get more people from the younger group , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: but not lose the one {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} I think the titanium is very important . user interface: Yeah alright but then we we won't get there . industrial designer: Yeah we have a problem , yeah . W But you can better , yeah , dump the L_C_D_ screen then . user interface: We can dump the special colour . We l we use plastic . And plastic is already in colour I think . marketing: I don't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen . industrial designer: Well what else ? user interface: No , nothing . industrial designer: W I mean uh {disfmarker} marketing: Or you shou {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} user interface: Amen . marketing: Or change the titanium or dump the L_C_D_ screen . But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Because you have lots of functions {vocalsound} in it too . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , well yeah . Alright . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Why can't I {disfmarker} user interface: But {disfmarker} industrial designer: I agree with that . So we u we use uh {disfmarker} Unfortunately . Um . Titanium-coloured plastic . project manager: I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days . marketing: Yeah , I agree . industrial designer: So titanium-coloured plastic for the back . project manager: I I'll talk to the managers . {vocalsound} user interface: No no no no . W Titanium stays there . project manager: Titanium , I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah this is good , marketing: Osl {vocalsound} industrial designer: but it it's not good enough . {vocalsound} So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid . project manager: Ah those {gap} those account managers , what do th d what do they know ? user interface: Well {disfmarker} project manager: Come on . Riot . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: What do we {disfmarker} Well what do we know ? All we want is a is a fancy design but we don't really consider the costs . So {disfmarker} project manager: Yes , yes . user interface: No because we did not know anything about it . project manager: One and a half Euros . Hmm ? industrial designer: Yeah al alright , yeah . marketing: If you don't have the money , you can't make it . industrial designer: But we have to deal with it now . So {disfmarker} marketing: So s If you don't have the money , you can't make it . So this is too expensive . project manager: So ? industrial designer: So {disfmarker} marketing: So we have to make it cheaper . industrial designer: Titanium gone and add plastic . user interface: Yeah , but then we've got money left . marketing: Right . industrial designer: And on plastic times two and then we uh are there ? project manager: Well , no it's just uh all plastic . industrial designer: No {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Well alright . Huh . industrial designer: {vocalsound} No yeah well {disfmarker} project manager: {gap} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Oh six . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} It's just free , man . industrial designer: A lot of plastic , yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Four . So {disfmarker} industrial designer: No two for the to make it clear . project manager: But then we can add the special colour ? As we have money over uh left . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . project manager: And we still have money left . user interface: Yeah . W marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: What do we want , guys ? industrial designer: I want gold plating . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: No no um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah right . I want chrome . {vocalsound} user interface: Well I think uh the case is double curved then . project manager: Yes . user interface: Because you y have that curve industrial designer: {vocalsound} We have we have to uh fill {disfmarker} user interface: and you have that curve . project manager: Y Oh no . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Well , th that that is the problem . user interface: Yeah well uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: W we ha {vocalsound} project manager: Alright . industrial designer: No no no , but th that's not f um {disfmarker} project manager: Safe . user interface: Well y we have curves in all directions . industrial designer: Well you can you can double curve , if you don't have titanium . And that we dropped , project manager: So {disfmarker} alright . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: so it it can be done . {vocalsound} But it's pretty funny . We we do want to reach twelve point five . But it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven . project manager: Finance ? user interface: I mean , this this ain't titanium , but it looks like it . project manager: Well , guys ? industrial designer: We get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Guys ? user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: We have to dump our titanium , marketing: Shoot . project manager: and we'll hate the managers for that , but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Objection . user interface: Pro project . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project . {vocalsound} Well , {vocalsound} satisfaction on for example , are we satisfactory about our creativity ? industrial designer: Well I can't get no satisfaction , but uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I think it's uh {disfmarker} Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: Yeah , me too . project manager: That's really bad . But that that that's that , yeah that's a reason , industrial designer: Its it's uh ridiculous actually , but {disfmarker} user interface: And uh unrealistic . project manager: but also for our creativity . We had um nice design , and then you get the cost , and you had to dump all your creativity . user interface: Well we we we used our creativity , marketing: Right . user interface: but we just had to adapt it to the costs . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Which isn't very practical , project manager: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Nei . Uh no . {vocalsound} industrial designer: but {vocalsound} that's the way . project manager: Well , alright . industrial designer: Uh-huh . {vocalsound} project manager: Uh leadership next . user interface: {vocalsound} Terrible . {vocalsound} project manager: Uh teamwork ? {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Leadership . user interface: Leadership ? Well {disfmarker} marketing: Well it's {vocalsound} {disfmarker} It was very democratic . {vocalsound} project manager: Uh yeah well {vocalsound} I think so also . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: I al I I've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time , so {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Well the managers were terrible . So , with their all their useless requirements . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: But o alright , the teamwork ? industrial designer: Well uh they they didn't think of the requirements . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: It's the requirements of the user , uh I guess . project manager: No they said , oh we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext , uh we won't use the D_V_D_ . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah but they base that on on the user specifications . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Alright , teamwork ? Well great I think . marketing: Well {disfmarker} user interface: Right yeah . {gap} marketing: Yeah , think so too . project manager: Uh well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} It was a complete disaster . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , I don't like it . Yeah ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} No {disfmarker} Uh it it it uh it is uh {disfmarker} project manager: Well {disfmarker} user interface: No , that's a SMARTboard , and that's a digital pen . project manager: It's also a It's both the SMARTboards . user interface: Or not ? marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: No it's other way around . That's the SMARTboard . project manager: I liked this SMARTboard , industrial designer: That's the digital panel . project manager: but I hated that one . marketing: This this this isn't a SMARTboard , right ? project manager: Well it's both a SMARTboard . industrial designer: That's that's the smart marketing: Yeah right . B but you {disfmarker} user interface: Oh they're both SMARTboards . {vocalsound} marketing: This is just a large t large television . project manager: No . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} A televi Yeah . marketing: You u you use the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: It's both a SMARTboard , but this one is used for a desktop , and that one is used to to draw . marketing: Yeah , but you ca This is just a beamer function . And here , on this one , you can uh draw the pictures and things like that . But {disfmarker} project manager: Well , wi w which one did you like ? user interface: {gap} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Left or right ? {vocalsound} marketing: That one . project manager: {vocalsound} That one . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} That one isn't accurate . {vocalsound} It just doesn't work . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: But I I think this is meant by the digital pen . marketing: You can {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: Yes . Th that is so . industrial designer: Well I didn't use uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , but I think there's a big distinction between the {vocalsound} these th project manager: We're now talking about the SMARTboards . user interface: Yeah . marketing: I don't need a SMARTboard . user interface: {gap} Well we we used that one , industrial designer: Nei It it's much m {vocalsound} user interface: and we needed it . I think . marketing: Yeah , but {vocalsound} give me a beamer . That's uh that's much uh much cheaper . user interface: Yeah alright , but {disfmarker} project manager: Or install a laptop to a beamer , or have this one standing here in an {disfmarker} I I like it . marketing: Right . project manager: Okay , alright . user interface: Yeah I like that one , but that one is terrible . industrial designer: But uh you can uh {disfmarker} I I sent it about three times now . Uh {vocalsound} a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing . project manager: Yeah . Yeah , it is . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: The simple uh sch school board . project manager: So {disfmarker} marketing: I agree . project manager: And uh the digi the digital pen ? Did uh did you like that one ? industrial designer: I I didn't use it . marketing: No . industrial designer: I wrote things down but I didn't import it into my laptop . project manager: I used it uh just to check it out , but uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} That's the {gap} {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: You you can't send that to anyone , because you you've scrabbled something on a page for yourself , user interface: {gap} marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} It isn't practical . Right . project manager: and then you're going to send it , yeah . Well , no . industrial designer: W {vocalsound} But also y you write things down . And i you can also bring your your your note block . marketing: Your notepad . Yeah . industrial designer: So what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into {disfmarker} project manager: It's , no , it it's useless . user interface: Well I I drew this . {gap} Mm . And I made a mistake . But it it would have been uh useful , if I I could show this on the screen . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yes . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah alright . For drawings , project manager: For drawings , yes . user interface: Yeah for drawings . industrial designer: but not for personal notes . I think that's not very {disfmarker} user interface: {gap} N notes mm . industrial designer: Uh I mean {vocalsound} you can bring your paperwork along and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper {disfmarker} project manager: But {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , it might be useful for drawings . I I agree on that . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: If you've {disfmarker} If you've {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: But for notes , it i you you have to put that in a strict {disfmarker} Uh you have to put a name , standard date , and all those things . And notes uh for a meeting are very strict . So if you uh were to write them down for yourself , and then put that in your computer , you still have to type it over to Word . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: So it doesn't d doesn't have any {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , right . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah I understand . marketing: That Stefan use . industrial designer: But I think uh d this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paperwork . {vocalsound} You can't {disfmarker} It's not very uh ni Yeah well a lot of documents are {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: No , I don't think so . It's it's only useful if you have to draw something . user interface: Yeah . But then uh it's really useful , I think . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yep . Alright . Um etcetera ? Well uh the laptops ? industrial designer: Mu Yeah right . project manager: Of course great . marketing: Yeah , great . Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . Hmm . industrial designer: Can we keep them ? Uh . project manager: Yeah . You can . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: B by my {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Wireless uh wireless things . user interface: Thanks Project Manager . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Other uh things we used here ? I hated the cameras , I hated the microphones . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Well these chairs , man . {vocalsound} Really great . industrial designer: Well did you really uh {disfmarker} Did you really take uh take those in account ? {vocalsound} I {vocalsound} half of time I didn't notice they were there . So {disfmarker} project manager: No . No . I haven't looked w one time directly at the camera . {vocalsound} I don't care about it . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} But we shouldn't talk about that . user interface: Well I did . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Because {vocalsound} this is a realistic environment . project manager: Well w why not ? Uh etcetera {gap} {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} industrial designer: {gap} project manager: {vocalsound} N new ideas found ? industrial designer: Right . Okay . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: What kind of ideas for n a future schedule {vocalsound} {disfmarker} What ? {vocalsound} For future um meetings {vocalsound} you have got ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Well I missed uh the option to uh to email , marketing: Communicate in between . user interface: yeah . project manager: Chatting and emailing . user interface: Email or chat or something . industrial designer: {vocalsound} But yeah . W well th that's just the the environment they set us up f with . So {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , right . Yeah . user interface: Yeah alright , but that's one n new idea . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , I agree . project manager: Well , new ideas found by this . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Not . Nothing . marketing: Well , more more information in the beginning . project manager: We don't want this . We hate this . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: That's {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: Digital pen is useless . So {disfmarker} user interface: No it isn't . project manager: Yeah , for drawings . industrial designer: Well , for drawing for drawings . Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . So it isn't useless . project manager: But uh two t But uh th then you have to have a lot of drawings , because if I had a company and I'm going to uh buy those expensive huge expensive uh things , I and I have to w pay those uh papers uh that are expensive , I'm not going to uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well {disfmarker} No {disfmarker} marketing: For people who uh sketch th the whole day , I can imagine that it's useful . project manager: {vocalsound} Well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: But it's still an expensive uh expensive {disfmarker} project manager: Because this is huge marketing: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: uh this v very very uh expensive paper . user interface: Well you you can't you can't draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand . marketing: Yeah , I agree . user interface: With the mouse it is {disfmarker} No . {gap} industrial designer: But if w Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Well and if {disfmarker} marketing: Mouse is ju just isn't working if you're sketching . user interface: Uh indeed . industrial designer: And but what if uh maybe this this board uh SMARTboard is malfunctioning or someone . But suppose it was working correctly , what uh would it be useful then , if it wasn't off all the time ? {vocalsound} A project manager: Well no . I hated to draw like that . You you can't draw anything uh neat . industrial designer: Really ? marketing: Yeah , but he's saying if it is correct , and you can draw very , {vocalsound} yeah , very precise {disfmarker} industrial designer: Anything you want . Any b b Yeah . L li li project manager: I if it if it would be perfect following . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Well th th then still it's it's it's very expensive uh towards a a just a green {gap} uh {gap} school board . industrial designer: Well it isn't , but maybe that thing is uh is {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , mu industrial designer: Yeah , board , a school board , yeah . user interface: Yeah , but but then you can uh save it in instantly , and and and re-use it , and uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yep . industrial designer: I it has {disfmarker} It is useful . Yeah . marketing: It saves time . project manager: Yeah yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: This uh if it works correct , maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So uh if we get in uh if we get another one and you make sure it does work , project manager: Yep . industrial designer: I think then it's pretty useful . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Because uh yeah you can draw t things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: And then you can save it immediately . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Well , they are now . user interface: Hmm . marketing: Celebration . project manager: It is .
