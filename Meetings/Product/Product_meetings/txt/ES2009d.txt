marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . Oh I totally {disfmarker} Yeah 'cause I moved it . {vocalsound} 'S put it over here . Then we don't have to worry about it . user interface: {vocalsound} Ready for this ? project manager: All set ? Cool . Alright , it is PowerPoint time . I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} . project manager: which is kind of fun . user interface: {vocalsound} Oh man . {vocalsound} project manager: So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} right so um , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my {disfmarker} that my coach was sending to me . It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting . industrial designer: Oh really ? project manager: I think . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Huh . project manager: I don't know . Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: and I'm {disfmarker} therefore I'm taking the minutes , s so just to go um {vocalsound} just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , uh , I will open them slowly , no ? Wait for it , wait for it . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah that's not you . {vocalsound} project manager: No . That's how the {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Wait . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , double-clicking , there we go . So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh {disfmarker} last meeting was that {vocalsound} um we that we had meetings from {disfmarker} uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we're operating with um {disfmarker} uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . That would include some {disfmarker} mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . Um , and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . {vocalsound} So . That's sorted , back to the main {vocalsound} meet here , um , go ahead and take it away guys . industrial designer: Well . Uh , we have assembled our prototype , um . What's to be said about it ? Um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um . Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um . This is going to be the on off button project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um . As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Ah . project manager: {vocalsound} Nice . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: why not ? marketing: {vocalsound} Fair enough . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . Um . project manager: {vocalsound} Perfect . industrial designer: Go ahead . user interface: No it's important to {vocalsound} we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here marketing: Mm . user interface: um f we call it fruity marketing: Right . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: if you will . Um . Right , um , marketing: Appropriate , okay . user interface: of course that's uh interchangeable industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued marketing: Mm 'kay . user interface: but this is kind of something that can be done marketing: It is an option . user interface: um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there . project manager: {vocalsound} Oh , right . industrial designer: That's this here . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Ah . I see . user interface: Um . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . Um , what other things do we see here , well , um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: um , so I think that will work well with regards to our market . Um and uh let's see , well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . {vocalsound} Um uh do you have anything else to add to that ? industrial designer: Um I worried about the materials , it is uh {disfmarker} the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped . Um , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel . user interface: It's actually important to note that the television , uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Fact , I dunno if you noticed , but I wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen , project manager: Oh well done yeah , yeah oh ok industrial designer: I thought that was kinda nice . marketing: Nice . industrial designer: This was actually an apple on the inside . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: This {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Do we need to worry about um rot factors ? {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Um {vocalsound} it's encased in a new uh type of uh marketing: Oh okay , there's preservatives involved , project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: polymer yeah . marketing: we don't need to worry , industrial designer: We got a bit ahead of ourselves , user interface: It's fine . marketing: okay . industrial designer: I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but {disfmarker} user interface: Hmm . marketing: Fair enough . project manager: {vocalsound} Edible televisions , it's a wave of the future . {vocalsound} marketing: No but {disfmarker} user interface: It's pos a possible new product . marketing: {vocalsound} It's a couple years off at least . Okay . user interface: Um , but I think that's {disfmarker} I think that sums up the main features of our {disfmarker} of the remote , project manager: Brilliant . industrial designer: Right . user interface: um I dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that uh {disfmarker} whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature . Um , did we come in under budget ? industrial designer: Uh we did , yeah . This cost {disfmarker} well to put this into um production , we're looking at about {disfmarker} what was our goal ? It was twelve fifty Euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Um , so I was quite pleased with that . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: One thing that we didn't do um {disfmarker} obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button and um since we did that marketing: Mm . industrial designer: we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down . project manager: Brilliant . industrial designer: So even though it has a lot of modern technology , um for example the voice recognition , marketing: Mm . industrial designer: in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and um I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper . marketing: Okay . user interface: Mm . {vocalsound} Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option ? industrial designer: And {disfmarker} Oh no , we haven't talked about that yet have we ? user interface: So uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . user interface: and uh I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Um , but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with . Basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier marketing: Mm 'kay . user interface: and um , I think that uh has given a proven um {vocalsound} ease of use and what not . industrial designer: Hmm . Yeah . user interface: And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um , so . marketing: Right . project manager: Cool . industrial designer: Any questions ? project manager: No , no marketing: {vocalsound} Do we have um other , for lack of a better word , skins ? Covers ? project manager: I think that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ? industrial designer: Um , do you wanna answer this one marketing: Do we know where we stand on that yet ? industrial designer: or do you want me to answer it ? user interface: Well we didn't quite have enough material uh {vocalsound} . marketing: Oh I wasn't expecting a prototype industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . user interface: Oh I see , marketing: I just didn't know {disfmarker} if you guys had any in mind yet . {vocalsound} user interface: right , um . industrial designer: Um , well {vocalsound} as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . Just veneer really , user interface: Right . marketing: yeah . Okay . user interface: Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that . marketing: And the whole thing {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay user interface: So I mean there are {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} marketing: Right user interface: we definitely priced out a spongy {disfmarker} even spongier non-natural look um materials marketing: Yeah . There's {disfmarker} Okay . user interface: which I think worked out fine . We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green . marketing: Mm 'kay . Okay , very cool . industrial designer: It's not it's not quite a a face plate , it's more like a pseudo-face plate because it's simple enough marketing: Okay . industrial designer: that in the factory it could {disfmarker} we could very easily put a different one on it , it locks into place such that , you know , it's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way marketing: Okay . industrial designer: if you know what I mean . marketing: Yep . It's still an option if we need it . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Very cool , nice job . project manager: Right , yeah thanks guys that's very , very good work . I like it , brilliant . {vocalsound} Um , {vocalsound} what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , um I got me {disfmarker} you've got {disfmarker} you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice . Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance . Um , it's a spreadsheet of the parts {vocalsound} industrial designer: Oh . project manager: and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um . industrial designer: Ooh . project manager: I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly , but it looks like {disfmarker} So we'll just {disfmarker} if we can just itemize what's in here , we've got this {disfmarker} it's a solar cell thing right ? industrial designer: Right project manager: With a back-up battery ? industrial designer: uh we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there , project manager: With the ba okay . Um industrial designer: yep . project manager: and {disfmarker} user interface: The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area . Yeah . project manager: Clever , clever , well done . Um so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it ? industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . It's just making use of the same space and the same materials , marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Okay . Um and the case , it's more of a single-curved case , I guess would be that {disfmarker} be the general {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , one big curve I guess you could say . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: {vocalsound} Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout . Um . Push button interface um with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we ? industrial designer: Yeah , mm-hmm . project manager: Um . And um a special {disfmarker} I guess it's uh {disfmarker} we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that {disfmarker} throughout , industrial designer: Yeah , special . project manager: yeah . industrial designer: And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , don't you ? 'Cause it i it is very unconventional , project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , it's it's quite unique . industrial designer: I like to think of it as unconventional . project manager: I like it , yeah it's {disfmarker} So it looks like marketing: M come in at sixteen ? project manager: a bit over budget , um . industrial designer: Oh . Huh , doesn't match up does it ? user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: So what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells {vocalsound} um or take out the back-up battery . Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: How do you feel about that ? user interface: I mean I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that {disfmarker} you know what the sell is on that . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . industrial designer: what am I gonna do ? marketing: Mm k . industrial designer: People'd be real upset . I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery , marketing: True . industrial designer: it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have . project manager: Hmm . {vocalsound} What's difficult , we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just can't back out of now , marketing: Nah . project manager: it would have to be {disfmarker} seems like we'd have to go back to square one in a way . Um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it , um {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental {disfmarker} I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I've done my math correctly . industrial designer: Hmm . user interface: I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing marketing: I mean {disfmarker} user interface: I mean that's what sets us apart marketing: Which , it's {disfmarker} user interface: right ? marketing: yeah that's what setting us into this young market , I mean that's where we started from , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't know , and I mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league . industrial designer: Right . user interface: And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell , but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here marketing: Right . Yeah . industrial designer: Right . user interface: and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here project manager: It's either or . marketing: Yeah . user interface: and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell . industrial designer: Yeah . I guess we might have to do that . marketing: I think unfortunately that's our best option . industrial designer: It's the only way we're gonna get below our uh goal isn't it ? Of twelve fifty . marketing: Mm . project manager: 'Cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , {vocalsound} . marketing: {vocalsound} It {disfmarker} kind of {disfmarker} project manager: um and we can't get rid of the uh {disfmarker} I mean removing the {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Savings . marketing: yeah . project manager: changing the case wouldn't be so much of a {vocalsound} mm-mm , um , nor would changing the case materials . marketing: Mm-mm . project manager: Um . So yeah that looks like to be the only thing . So that would be the {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . project manager: it's a major change but {disfmarker} Yeah . Alright , so industrial designer: Gotta do what you gotta do . project manager: we're in agreement on that . marketing: Unfortunately I think we are . user interface: No , I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah . project manager: {vocalsound} Right . Moving along swiftly . Um , so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over . marketing: That would be me . Um cord ? project manager: Ah of course , sorry . marketing: No problem . project manager: Whoosh . marketing: Can you reach , user interface: Yep . marketing: that would be great , thank you . project manager: {vocalsound} That'd be great {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} I didn't even do that one on purpose either , user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: damn . Okay , um , basically I was just evaluating um {vocalsound} from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of {disfmarker} these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they're important . Um so I was looking at basic design things , does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? Is the design what we wanted it to do ? I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? Um . Basic questions like , you know , does it turn on ? Does it respond to voice recognition ? And overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Um , the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface , um that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Really good . marketing: So I think overall we're headed in the right direction . {vocalsound} So . user interface: They like that spongy feel . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . It looks like it's going over well , so user interface: And the paging function works well , industrial designer: Six ? user interface: that's good to hear , marketing: we're we're good yeah . user interface: we worked hard on that one . project manager: {vocalsound} Brilliant . industrial designer: We did . marketing: Yeah . It's {disfmarker} I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , but for now , what we've got is working in the range we need it for , so it's all good . industrial designer: I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel marketing: That's everything from me . project manager: Hmm . industrial designer: but it's okay . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Yeah , it is a set-back , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay , do you need the cord back ? project manager: Um yeah , user interface: W we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again project manager: I was just {disfmarker} go on . industrial designer: I know . user interface: that we're {disfmarker} project manager: Well they don't own tellys anyway do they ? industrial designer: True . user interface: I guess that's true . project manager: Right . So , um , {vocalsound} this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um . I got this slide from the coach and I'm not sure what it's connected to . Um so I guess we are going to discuss um {vocalsound} our project process um marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: and that is gonna go into my report . So I guess this is the point where we go um {vocalsound} uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , I guess , um . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: As in within the team or ? project manager: I think so yeah . industrial designer: Right so it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . project manager: I think it's {disfmarker} I mm-hmm , I think so . I think {vocalsound} hope I'm not screwing up an experiment {vocalsound} . industrial designer: 'Kay . marketing: It is now , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: you're in charge there you go {vocalsound} . so {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: But I trust that she would jump in if I was so okay fair enough . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Whatever {vocalsound} . project manager: Um right , um so any thoughts ? industrial designer: Are we considering these points here ? marketing: Um . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: I think they're starting blocks yeah . project manager: What do you guys feel about the process ? industrial designer: {gap} marketing: Um , you know I think in general , for a day's worth of work we actually were {vocalsound} relatively productive , project manager: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . marketing: considering the little amount of input we had going in . Um , and the technology has definitely been a help , it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff . user interface: We didn't use the whiteboard at all . project manager: No , no whiteboard . {vocalsound} industrial designer: No . marketing: {vocalsound} No , we didn't . We could now if that'd make up for it user interface: {vocalsound} And {disfmarker} marketing: but really {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter . user interface: Um , also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I don't think I woulda used it at all , I didn't write barely anything . marketing: Yeah I think I was taking {vocalsound} notes more often than usual industrial designer: Yeah , it's true . marketing: just 'cause I liked the pen , yeah . industrial designer: Mm . user interface: Uh . project manager: Was pretty cool tack though . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Definitely . marketing: Mm . I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: As you write your personal coach . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , but I didn't get a response {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} What if you get a response two or three months from now ? user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: so {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: we'll see {vocalsound} . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: That'd be weird . marketing: Okay that would be kinda creepy . project manager: Attempts to contact coach ineffective {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Well user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: what kind of coaching is that really ? What if I really needed something . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} so n I think there was a lot of room for creativity , I don't we could do whatever {disfmarker} basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , um . marketing: I think so . And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: With the natural look . project manager: {vocalsound} Very natural look . industrial designer: That's very natural . marketing: {vocalsound} Organic , really . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} That's the brilliance of {disfmarker} they had a p they had a peeler in here . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: And highly resourceful team mates might I add industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: which is always a plus . project manager: Yeah , I think , yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually , I mean . user interface: {vocalsound} I think the teamwork was good as well . marketing: Mm yeah , I'm impressed . industrial designer: And to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of Play-Doh , we used every bit . marketing: {vocalsound} Nice . All four of those little containers . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Including the s the multi-coloured wave pattern . industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I guess {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: we only had four , wasn't enough . marketing: You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I know it could have been amazing . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Oh well . project manager: What did you guys think about the the the roles ? industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: They were good {vocalsound} . industrial designer: Yeah it's f kind of fun , it was {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough . marketing: True . industrial designer: At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up , project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Do your own . industrial designer: which was kind of fun . marketing: Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: I mean maybe it's just me but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . project manager: That's true , I I got this spreadsheet {vocalsound} . marketing: Nothing , I didn't even get an email , user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: like industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: that was it . So , yeah , I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped . user interface: Well I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to {disfmarker} marketing: Whatever . project manager: Of what to do . user interface: well no but also {disfmarker} yeah when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Mm-hmm . Uh-huh , that wasn't very much . {vocalsound} industrial designer: You know {disfmarker} user interface: um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was marketing: Mm . user interface: because that was kind of the interface portion industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: which was what the whole project was about marketing: Yes . project manager: Mm , mm . user interface: uh marketing: Hmm , very much so . user interface: but {disfmarker} and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , industrial designer: Yeah . That was fun . I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you user interface: which was fine . Mm-hmm . industrial designer: 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time . marketing: Yeah , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot . Very much so . project manager: Cool . user interface: And I think your leadership was quite good . industrial designer: It was really good yeah . marketing: Hmm . project manager: She said I I I she actually made a comment off {gap} boy you're getting into this and I really I think it's true I did get {disfmarker} I I felt like I got way too into it . marketing: Yeah . That's kind of a good thing though , project manager: I felt like I slipped into it a lot . industrial designer: It's kinda fun . marketing: you know , give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey . project manager: I dunno . user interface: An so is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role ? project manager: The first time I've ever done anything like yeah project project management . I usually organise crap , marketing: Hmm . project manager: it's one thing to do , you know {disfmarker} set up a party with your friends , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: you know ? industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Little different . project manager: But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the {disfmarker} okay ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: I except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: and I knew we were all lying through our teeth , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} I had to admit , as soon as w we started {disfmarker} I mean as soon as we got the Play-Doh , {vocalsound} th {vocalsound} you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window {vocalsound} . marketing: other than that {vocalsound} {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} I could only imagine . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Maybe in in Legos you know ? Be fun with Legos too , user interface: Possibly . project manager: like make a remote control or spaceship , we used to have spaceship Legos {disfmarker} did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos {disfmarker} user interface: Oh yeah , marketing: Yeah . Totally . project manager: everybody knows {disfmarker} best spaceships ever . user interface: still have 'em . project manager: Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? industrial designer: Yeah ? marketing: I think so . user interface: Yep . project manager: Hmm . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: No I , no I dunno , I d I I dunno , industrial designer: {vocalsound} You don't . project manager: I don't {disfmarker} I I was just {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} marketing: Though we didn't actually {disfmarker} I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't {disfmarker} except for the actual building , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: It's true huh ? marketing: but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board {disfmarker} well and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings . project manager: Yeah . user interface: I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team . I mean industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: That's true . project manager: Yeah . Course I'm I'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team {vocalsound} you know it's like , kind of like , like hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: It d marketing: Yeah that is kind of {disfmarker} project manager: But yeah . Interesting . It's kind of fascinating wasn't it ? I mean the whole process of {disfmarker} industrial designer: Wonder why {disfmarker} is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ? project manager: I don't know . {vocalsound} I I don't know if there was a ri I th marketing: Mine was the mics . I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , industrial designer: Yeah , that's it marketing: I was afraid I was gonna break something actually . industrial designer: 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Mm . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . user interface: Well I dunno what I woulda shown on that board . marketing: Yeah . True , but it didn't even occur to me as an option , project manager: Nor I . marketing: I mean I don't know that I would have but I know that I consciously didn't . user interface: I mean it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for . marketing: True . user interface: Um , because I've got this laptop . Standard , marketing: Yeah . user interface: I just used it 'cause it's literally right in front of me . project manager: I wanna see the output files from these um , from the digital paper . marketing: Yeah . Well it looks really professional . project manager: I wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized marketing: I know . project manager: because my handwriting is crap . industrial designer: Yeah , project manager: I mean , just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something . industrial designer: that's it . Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I didn't because {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: I know , I felt like I needed to be professional so I didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Okay , well not entirely , but still , I doodled less than I usually do . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: T I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like . You know , like what is the uh what exactly we're looking for here . user interface: So is this all we need to get through ? project manager: I dunno , I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about . marketing: I guess . industrial designer: New ideas . marketing: Um . user interface: Is it {disfmarker} marketing: It {disfmarker} did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ? project manager: Well , that's the thing I got {disfmarker} i in the email I got this PowerPoint file but this slide was just there , marketing: That slide was like that ? project manager: mm-hmm . I didn't change this one at all . industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: Well . project manager: Um ch industrial designer: I guess we're on the right track . project manager: Yeah well . {vocalsound} user interface: Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ? {vocalsound} project manager: W {gap} {vocalsound} I kinda like th industrial designer: No , none . marketing: Uh I think they still do their job . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah you can't {disfmarker} industrial designer: I think they're fine actually . marketing: I am thinking outside the little square box though , with literally in like form project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , maybe a s a circle would be alright , different . marketing: I don't {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: Does kinda make you wonder , I mean , how much can you do with a remote control ? It's like inventing a new car . Yeah yeah , you can {disfmarker} marketing: It's still gotta be technically car shaped or it won't fit on the road , project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: you know ? {vocalsound} Don't know . project manager: Hmm . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Um . 'Kay . user interface: What is that ? Our limited ability to think outside the box ? project manager: So this was other costs . marketing: Kind of . industrial designer: Are we back into project mood ? project manager: I dunno . I think this is marketing: Oh , how long was our meeting supposed to be ? project manager: forty ish marketing: How much time do we have left ? project manager: I I I mm we should go on a bit {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} about the project eval , um . I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing . Like , what like you know what am I really doing , marketing: Mm . project manager: you know what is {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work project manager: Yep . marketing: and I was like {disfmarker} had like all this brainstorming I was doing industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about anyway user interface: {vocalsound} Why ? project manager: Hey . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: so type away . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Huh I think it was the real {gap} . marketing: You know , you know what I mean industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore . industrial designer: Definitely when {vocalsound} when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to {disfmarker} how much I stressed over it user interface: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: and then by the time I got to the last one I was like , you know , not very much . marketing: Whatever . {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Mm . user interface: Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation industrial designer: Yeah {vocalsound} . marketing: {vocalsound} Very much , yeah . user interface: which uh wasn't so clear to me at the beginning . project manager: {vocalsound} I actually didn't do that at all though , industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: every single one I {disfmarker} a all the presentations I either added slides or edited 'em . I di user interface: Oh I added like five slides too , marketing: {vocalsound} See project manager: Oh . industrial designer: Did you really ? user interface: but I {disfmarker} marketing: I only got blank ones . industrial designer: I just got blank ones project manager: What ? Really ? industrial designer: and {disfmarker} marketing: My slides were all blank , they'd have a title maybe user interface: Yeah , mine too . marketing: and they were just empty . project manager: Did they not have {disfmarker} they didn't like {disfmarker} uh mine {disfmarker} industrial designer: Me too . project manager: yeah they didn't come like this ? Like with {disfmarker} this was what it looks like . This is what that looked like , marketing: Like with those words already on it ? project manager: literally , just like that . user interface: No . marketing: No . project manager: Interesting . marketing: I wondered why yours always looked so more complicated . {vocalsound} project manager: Uh-huh huh huh . industrial designer: I deleted slides {vocalsound} . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: I think I added a slide one time . user interface: I added many slides every time {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Hey industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class . user interface: Yeah {vocalsound} . industrial designer: That was pretty cool , it was a high moment of the whole experiment . user interface: {vocalsound} Um . marketing: Mm . project manager: Interesting . Any other thoughts come to mind ? marketing: I wanna know how our product would fare . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I think it would fail , I think marketing: I can't just leave it there . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: it'd be a huge disaster , especially if it looks like that . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} I think it would take extensive marketing , okay , an apple with a red button on top , even I am sceptical . {vocalsound} But you know the whole {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: Even you {vocalsound} . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah {vocalsound} . industrial designer: I don't {disfmarker} we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah but {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: I know it is {vocalsound} . industrial designer: It's a happy face . user interface: Actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to uh fr some other design uh modifications {vocalsound} . marketing: Mm . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Builds . Mm . user interface: I hope you appreciate the uh incorporation of some tin foil from a uh random Kit-Kat bar project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} I I noticed that . {vocalsound} By accident . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: that happened to be consumed . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Interesting . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: Well huh . An interesting day all in all I would say . project manager: Uh , yeah , I'd say so . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , it's uh {disfmarker} user interface: So again I reiterate my question of how different we are comp compared to the other groups , especially between culture groups and what not . project manager: Mm , I know . marketing: I know . user interface: Mm . project manager: It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically . You know from the the the basics to the conce industrial designer: I wanna see a {disfmarker} marketing: I Yeah . project manager: although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , I don't think I really understood like the concept . Well the id okay the notion of {disfmarker} marketing: 'Cause it's such a functional item . project manager: yeah I mean i it's not like I have a concept of a mug's material , it's just it is what it is . You know , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of {disfmarker} we sh I I thought of I thought of {disfmarker} rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of proposed idea . And then the final would be like th the actual specified prototype or whatever , marketing: Mm . project manager: I dunno . But . All in all it's kinda interesting . industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: So we have more slides or ? marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: No just this closing one . No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , but we could s you know do it {disfmarker} marketing: We got it to be . project manager: We did the project evaluation based on um {vocalsound} Sarah's evaluation of on off switches marketing: Like cutting corners . Kind of , project manager: and {disfmarker} marketing: though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general . project manager: Mm . True . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Which I'm not sure is the same thing , at the time that just i made more sense , but I could see if they were really asking about us . project manager: Yeah . 'Cause we di we had a thu think about it . Um . Yeah . And it's all recorded , woo-hoo . Yeah what I'm gonna {disfmarker} I'm gonna put um {vocalsound} industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: Yay . project manager: I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like {disfmarker} maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports . industrial designer: I {vocalsound} It'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording . marketing: {vocalsound} Make it sound eloquent . Oh , I have to done {disfmarker} I've {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Nice . marketing: I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that project manager: Oh yeah . marketing: that mean nothing . project manager: There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics . industrial designer: Really . user interface: What the uhs and the {disfmarker} marketing: There's a guy studying it here , yeah , he's studying ums and ahs or something . industrial designer: Filler words or ? project manager: Yep , they're called um disfluencies . industrial designer: Disfluencies . marketing: That's a good word for it . project manager: Yeah we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Just add some prefixes , sounds classier . project manager: Exactly uh I will save this into the project documents . industrial designer: I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom , project manager: Yeah . Oh yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah I know . user interface: Mm . marketing: I , yeah , industrial designer: like c come on gimme something . marketing: pretty compulsively during meetings , like , yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Come on give me some information . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Well to be fair we're we're hooked {disfmarker} we're all hooked on the internet , so I mean I do the {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , we are addicts . user interface: That's scary industrial designer: It is scary . user interface: yeah ? marketing: Mm . user interface: Well just around that eight or or nine people that are {disfmarker} project manager: I know , imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: I mean , you know , it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time . marketing: I yeah . user interface: Dude , I think we've had internet for like eighteen years . marketing: True . project manager: No we have but I {disfmarker} not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous marketing: I yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: But it's not regular I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four , but still . industrial designer: It's crazy . So {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} Uh-huh . user interface: In the eighties ? marketing: My um grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had um an E_D_U_ and gov network . project manager: Mm . marketing: There's basically the fundamental structures , but it wasn't uh household to household yet user interface: Right . marketing: because it hadn't been user interface: Yeah , it was to the like seven universities or something . marketing: partitioned off and stuff , yeah that was him . user interface: You guys ready to celebrate ? project manager: Yeah that's our last step . Celebration . marketing: Apparently , does that include like champagne or something exciting ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Should . project manager: 'Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part . marketing: I think so . I think that's a closer . project manager: Cool . industrial designer: Has it been forty minutes or whatever ? {gap} this has been long enough . user interface: {vocalsound} Celebrate . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Where do you find that ? marketing: {vocalsound} I have no idea . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Is that the only song you have ? user interface: There is another one . {vocalsound} project manager: Is this one of those media player ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Huh ? project manager: W oh . industrial designer: That's awesome . user interface: Yep . {vocalsound} project manager: The default track . I thought it was David Burns , look into the eyeball . industrial designer: Maybe I have a different one . project manager: That's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while , maybe this is the new version . marketing: So is that a close ? project manager: Yeah , I guess we'll call that a a doner . marketing: Okay , that's the end of the meeting . project manager: Fab . marketing: Thank you gentlemen .
