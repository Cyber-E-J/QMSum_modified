marketing: Did you get my email with the slides ? Ah . Tricky . industrial designer: I guess I have to change the pen otherwise . Will be completely different . marketing: Dunno . Maybe they're supposed {disfmarker} the pen's supposed to go over the seats . Might be seat floor rather than person . Yeah , put it back . industrial designer: Yeah . And do you think {vocalsound} it's {gap} . marketing: Yep {vocalsound} . Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: Jo's making faces at me . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So . Matthew is uh late again . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: {vocalsound} Probably an important man . Um . So well it is important for him to be here uh . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: He he he {disfmarker} industrial designer: So what can you {disfmarker} {gap} ? project manager: You did work together didn't you ? industrial designer: Yeah we will {disfmarker} yeah , so I will be able to to summarize uh our meeting , project manager: Yes . industrial designer: but still I think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer . I think we can put on the {gap} here . project manager: Yes . Yes . industrial designer: Uh basically w yeah we we designed the two uh items . project manager: Mm . Um yes industrial designer: Um , can we have a phone , project manager: but w we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: can someone {disfmarker} project manager: Yes , maybe we should phone him . Um well {disfmarker} Um , industrial designer: it's really w well designed {vocalsound} . marketing: Mm . Mm , object tracking . {vocalsound} project manager: when he is not here we will just we just have to continue . Um so just for record I I will take uh notes again . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Okay . project manager: And um well {vocalsound} first thing uh I was uh uh I got an email from uh from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve Euro and fifty cents . industrial designer: 'Kay . project manager: when you stay in it's good , when you don't stay in you have to redesign . There is no {vocalsound} uh no negotiation uh {vocalsound} possible in this matter . So we have to consider that . {vocalsound} Good . industrial designer: Yep . project manager: Um so maybe Anna , you can have your presentation . marketing: Well we can't {disfmarker} no {disfmarker} we can't do evaluation 'til we have a design . project manager: Okay Matthew . Nice uh you are here . industrial designer: Great . project manager: Great . Great . Oh ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs . industrial designer: Yep . So I will start by the the basic one that uh fits into uh eight Euros actually , right , seven eight Euros , marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: and uh well first for both they have um a special shape , maybe the designer can uh explain better than me , but uh it's like a surf board . marketing: Mm 'kay . industrial designer: And you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf T_V_ , maybe the web , and uh it's kind of interesting shape because um unconsciously people want to s to surf {vocalsound} when they see this stuff . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Or browse . industrial designer: And also it's not too far from um a mobile . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: So people are used to that kind of shape , user interface: Mm . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: right . Don't take care too much about the colour because w yeah we don't take {disfmarker} user interface: Now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now . industrial designer: yeah . So here would be basically the the the infrared uh uh led marketing: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . project manager: Eye . user interface: {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: yeah L_A_ L_A_ L_E_D_ , user interface: L_E_D_ . industrial designer: the on-off button , in red . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Here would be the volume . On the on the left , marketing: Oh yeah . project manager: Uh-huh . industrial designer: okay , so {gap} user interface: Mm-hmm , hmm . project manager: Yes . industrial designer: easy to turn on t and off . And um so this is a very cheap version so there are {disfmarker} maybe you can carry on uh Matthew . user interface: Also {vocalsound} so you have uh uh browsing the channels , actually marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: so you can go up and down the channels , marketing: Yeah . user interface: uh , if you have a video or something you can forward , back . industrial designer: How can you change from V_C_R_ to uh T_V_ , by the way ? user interface: Oh {gap} no no no , this is a single {disfmarker} this this is a model with just the T_V_ one . industrial designer: Okay yeah . Yeah yeah . project manager: Ah , okay . user interface: No no just sorry , this is a standard T_V_ one , we are not talking about that . So and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: The extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel . And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that . Actually . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Okay so project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: it's it's t a very basic remote then , it's only {disfmarker} user interface: It's a very basic minimal thing marketing: Mm . project manager: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . user interface: which you can {disfmarker} which is which is also available in the market , actually that's what it {gap} {disfmarker} that it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: and would cost us to build it about eight Euros . project manager: Mm . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Seven , eight , ei eight Euros . project manager: Exce except for the for the special shape , the surfing board , it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: So this one model marketing: Can I see ? user interface: and uh {disfmarker} yeah . Sure . marketing: Thanks . Okay I like the volume control , that's good . industrial designer: {gap} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Th {vocalsound} this is a magic one but I know we don't want to talk about that , marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: you know like {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: uh i i i it is a very futuristic , it's like uh it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future , it can come . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh-huh . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: So it doesn't actually have buttons . user interface: {vocalsound} So that uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} then what we look t marketing: Did you wanna see ? user interface: yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . Yeah no you can carry on , user interface: This is a model , project manager: I just look how it feels all . user interface: yeah . project manager: Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yep . project manager: Just I'm {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah actually , yeah . project manager: I really want to talk to it . marketing: {vocalsound} It won't talk back . {vocalsound} project manager: But {gap} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} So but but continue with your uh user interface: Uh so well project manager: mm-hmm . user interface: then the this is the {vocalsound} a more a little uh smooth industrial designer: {gap} user interface: and it gives a lot of functionality , uh in this way , so all we have uh th you see there are only six keys , but don't worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here . marketing: Right . project manager: Mm . user interface: And so they have more space actually marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: and uh it's easy to uh use this and uh you have um so this is a standard uh {gap} uh infrared eye , and then you have a power button , which l volume , what you have , project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo industrial designer: Play , pause . user interface: yeah s pause or stop , and uh then uh you can uh you have a L_C_D_ display , here project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: and uh y this is a functional thing which can change like it's a toggle switch which could change the function say , y you press it {disfmarker} project manager: From D_V_D_ player to television or something . industrial designer: Exactly yeah . To audio and to video on demand . user interface: Yeah . I really can change it , project manager: Yes . user interface: so {disfmarker} project manager: Mm . user interface: Instead of having many switches , y {vocalsound} marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Yes and and and then you get feedback via the L_C_D_ yeah . user interface: The L_C_D_ can display what is that on that , industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: and uh well you can have a integrated microphone over here , industrial designer: This is the orange button , the {vocalsound} microphone . user interface: or in the button th here , project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: so which can uh basically you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display . industrial designer: An yeah . user interface: And here is a small L_E_D_ which is like blinking one , project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery , and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier project manager: Mm-hmm {vocalsound} . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: okay . And uh well then we have a cover basically , basically you don't need much of the time this , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} when you need you can use it , and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing to this cover project manager: Mm . Yeah industrial designer: {vocalsound} Crazy dis designer , user interface: you know . industrial designer: okay . {vocalsound} user interface: Design enter {vocalsound} . project manager: but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed , will it also uh cover up the L_C_D_ screen ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah yeah . user interface: Yeah . It's basically to do that . project manager: But but the L_C_D_ screen I mean is a very uh well an eye-attracting feature industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: which shouldn't be shouldn't be {disfmarker} user interface: Actually when you are watching the T_V_ , {vocalsound} when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here , industrial designer: Oh actually {disfmarker} well . project manager: {vocalsound} That th that's true . user interface: you know , uh you want to uh {disfmarker} and this gives a protection to the L_C_D_ actually , giving a cover to that actually . Gives a protection project manager: Mm . user interface: because when it falls down or something it it is it is is is it gives a protec project manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yes . Yes , more robust . user interface: it's more robust that way . Uh yeah . marketing: Mm . project manager: Yes okay . user interface: And you have very good chances {disfmarker} industrial designer: It's low weight . You have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: So the the cost is actually a bit more , it's uh {vocalsound} it's it's sixteen Francs . user interface: It {disfmarker} Sixteen Euros . project manager: {gap} Okay . industrial designer: Sixteen Euros sorry . marketing: So it's well outside the budget then . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Then it's out of budget . project manager: But w industrial designer: But the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer . And they say basically that the S_R_ system would be uh something like three Francs per item {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: so user interface: Three Euros . industrial designer: three Euros sorry . And um {disfmarker} marketing: That's on top of the sixteen , or is it part of that ? industrial designer: No no no , part of that , yeah . user interface: Part of that {gap} . marketing: So that takes it down to thirteen Euros without the speech recognition . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Mm 'kay . Hmm . {gap} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Well uh if you {disfmarker} we can have {disfmarker} if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys if you want to you know {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Well I think th th yeah we should {vocalsound} stick with uh a number of keys marketing: Mm . industrial designer: because if we add too much then user interface: Yeah project manager: Mm-hmm {gap} . industrial designer: it's too {disfmarker} user interface: it it should not be cluttering up everything . marketing: What's this one on the side ? user interface: Ah that's for the {disfmarker} it's kind of a L_E_D_ for indicating your battery industrial designer: Locati . Location . marketing: Ah okay . user interface: and as well as it's like a blinking one marketing: Mm-hmm . Mm 'kay . user interface: you know industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: you can keep it aside . marketing: I like the shape of them , I do like the the size and the the shape . project manager: Well well {disfmarker} Mm . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible , maybe Anna you can uh give our uh give us your um {disfmarker} marketing: Mm-hmm . Okay . And maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products , both of these two . project manager: Yes . Evalua evaluation and also the evaluation criteria , so what what is important to look at . marketing: Okay . {vocalsound} Basically this is what we've talked about already , um , from the marketing point of view . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: We just wanna make sure that we've taken into account {disfmarker} project manager: Well marketing: Yep . project manager: just do it quickly if if we al already {gap} . marketing: So it's just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Um we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that , so just average the score of those items , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} These are the things we identified as being important . Um {gap} the three things were look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic . And then goin following the company motto , following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well . So well do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them ? project manager: Um , n no why not why not discuss uh discuss it now , {gap} {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . So f just go through onto the whiteboard I guess . Not sure how this is gonna come out . So the first one was really {vocalsound} very far below budget , would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it ? 'Cause if we're only going to make it for eight Euros then we have a {disfmarker} project manager: Mm , well my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight Euros we must think how can we improve it . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: And then {disfmarker} I mean w w w you must just see it {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we can still spend this four and a half Euro marketing: Mm-hmm . Yep . project manager: and to r because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five Euros industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: so we just have to offer as much as as {disfmarker} well value for the for the customer uh he can have for twenty five Euro . industrial designer: Functionality . marketing: Okay so look and feel , innovation {disfmarker} {gap} user interface: And now it {gap} easy to use . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Easy to use . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: {gap} target . marketing: Mm-hmm . And trends . Oh , you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these ? Is that part of both of them or ? project manager: Um well w w we can still discuss that . marketing: Okay . project manager: So um , and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: I mean adding things or uh removing uh of options because they are too expensive , marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: but um I've received uh a framework which we can do this . I mean did you have this this Excel sheet ? marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: No . user interface: No . marketing: No . project manager: No okay , this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro uh fifty cents uh . marketing: Mm-hmm . Okay . project manager: So maybe we can start with this , uh , calling this one . {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . Yep . So it's the pink . project manager: Th th this is the first design . marketing: And the other one's green . Okay , so project manager: Yes . marketing: look and feel ? Where um one is {vocalsound} I've broken the pen again . S project manager: Uh there is another pen . marketing: yeah . Get that one . Um w {vocalsound} one's bad and seven's the best . Sorry , one's true and seven's false . One's the best . project manager: Okay . marketing: So on a scale of one to seven ? project manager: 'Kay . Okay . So . Look and feel . Well you already feel that uh pretty much I think {vocalsound} . user interface: {vocalsound} {gap} project manager: In i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good , is very good in your hand , marketing: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm , yeah . Mm-hmm . project manager: so I I I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: But that's just half , we should also consider look , marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: and then i it looks quite conventional . marketing: Mm . project manager: Don't you agree ? user interface: Mm yeah . marketing: On the scale u it's between functional and fancy basically we're looking at , project manager: So maybe two . Hmm . Hmm . Ma ma ma ma maybe say say five marketing: so {disfmarker} project manager: I {disfmarker} It's my opinion , but I don't know what what user interface: Well I will give it maybe {disfmarker} we have anyways {disfmarker} the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say {vocalsound} marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: you know . It {disfmarker} though the look is fine but uh still I will give four in that case industrial designer: Yeah . Four maybe . user interface: you know . marketing: Four ? Okay . project manager: Four , four . user interface: Four yeah project manager: Now we th th user interface: that {disfmarker} marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: then we settle on four . user interface: Yeah . I will gi yeah . marketing: {gap} project manager: 'Kay . Can you maybe fix the other {disfmarker} industrial designer: Uh . Yeah . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: If you press like this not like this {gap} then you {disfmarker} marketing: No that's the {disfmarker} industrial designer: {gap} user interface: No . marketing: ink's dried . user interface: C can you get the batteries ? No no the battery has fallen down , marketing: Battery's low , isn't it the ink ? user interface: that's i marketing: The b that's the that that one ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: {gap} battery there . industrial designer: But {disfmarker} user interface: No no it's not that , it's how to close a battery . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Okay ? Now it should be {gap} . marketing: Mm . No I think it's lost a battery . project manager: Mm , try it , just try it . marketing: No it's {disfmarker} It would still write project manager: Oh it will not marketing: but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors . project manager: ri mm , mm . user interface: Is there another battery there ? Oh yeah . marketing: You got a second ? industrial designer: Try a {disfmarker} marketing: Well we won't be able to tell . project manager: Yes , it it has a {disfmarker} mm . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Perfect . marketing: Is that working ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Did it come out ? Good . Okay . project manager: Good . Good . marketing: Because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working , it's just a normal whiteboard marker industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . marketing: but it wouldn't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard . industrial designer: Yep . project manager: Okay . So then then {disfmarker} marketing: And the other one ? industrial designer: Wow . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: I think it's slightly better , um , project manager: Ah . Mm . marketing: it's hard to tell from just the plasticine , project manager: I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} marketing: but {disfmarker} project manager: When we want to include {disfmarker} I I I'm doubting about this this component . marketing: Mm . project manager: It it it it breaks in your {disfmarker} industrial designer: 'Kay marketing: Mm . industrial designer: maybe {disfmarker} user interface: No actually this is this is not going to protrude actually , marketing: Okay . user interface: it it's n i it is jus industrial designer: It's not a button it's a led , it's a {disfmarker} user interface: It's a led actually which which 'll be covering in a curve {disfmarker} industrial designer: Ac actually yeah it should be embedded . project manager: Mm , yes I see , mm okay . marketing: Mm-hmm . Yeah . user interface: It's {disfmarker} will be embedded there industrial designer: Yeah . Oh user interface: so it won't be really you know protruding or something . industrial designer: you can push push it again , you can push it . marketing: Yeah . The other thing is , is the left hand one protruding ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: 'Cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand , user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: maybe it won't work so well . user interface: No you {disfmarker} it it not protruding actually , it will go in better into that {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . project manager: Well r r marketing: I'd say two or three for that one , personally . project manager: Mm . marketing: Probably more towards three than two . project manager: I think the look is better industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: but the feel is is is worse . So so {vocalsound} I would also say this is four . marketing: Okay . project manager: But w w do you {disfmarker} what do you think ? user interface: Uh it's fine I think . My {disfmarker} just that um the feel is that um you {disfmarker} right now you you don't see the feel because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this , now it's embedded one . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Mm . Mm . Yes . user interface: This is how embedded one will {disfmarker} project manager: Yes , it basically is the same shape . user interface: Yeah . It's a bas basically the same thing actually . project manager: Mm-hmm . Mm . user interface: You will be {disfmarker} Except that in this c industrial designer: And the L_C_D_ makes it better . Yeah . user interface: Yeah {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . user interface: And {vocalsound} you might have a slight thing for to forward and {disfmarker} marketing: Mm , okay . Yeah industrial designer: So I will say two . marketing: it's d it's definitely more fancier than that one . project manager: Yes , okay {gap} . user interface: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: I would say two , three . marketing: Okay . user interface: Yeah . marketing: So , consensus ? Two or three ? project manager: Two ? marketing: Two ? project manager: Mm . Two's good industrial designer: Yep . project manager: yes . user interface: {gap} looking like {disfmarker} marketing: Um , 'kay . Innovation . The first one , not really muc industrial designer: Basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market , marketing: Mm . Yeah . industrial designer: right ? marketing: Do we {disfmarker} user interface: No but except for the design of the surf {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . The surf uh design {vocalsound} . marketing: Mm . project manager: Mm . marketing: What {disfmarker} What features are we actually including ? user interface: You should be rea {vocalsound} marketing: Are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it ? user interface: {vocalsound} Uh no marketing: There's nothing like that ? user interface: I think it's more of the feel . marketing: But th is there any there's no actual innovation in that at all , it's just a straight-out remote control . user interface: Yeah , yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Okay . project manager: The only innova innovation is the shape . industrial designer: Yeah {gap} . user interface: Say about that . marketing: Okay . project manager: S so that {disfmarker} marketing: So there's no {disfmarker} this uh look and feel thing , though that's not a technological innovation . industrial designer: Yeah . You're right {gap} . user interface: Yeah . marketing: So I'd be up for seven for innovation . industrial designer: Yeah . And the {disfmarker} And the second one is really uh state of the art , uh in terms of innovation . user interface: Yep . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: And um with many more functionalities , and can open and close the the bottom part . user interface: Yeah , it gives it {disfmarker} project manager: Yes . A and the L_C_D_ screen is {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: That's that's that's well it's quite innovative . industrial designer: And all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: Uh could put it at one or two I would say . Personally . marketing: Okay . project manager: Yeah . Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm . user interface: Yep . marketing: So what is it , what are the innovations with this ? Got the L_C_D_ screen . industrial designer: Uh {disfmarker} Yeah automatic speech recognition . marketing: Is that in this one though ? Is this {disfmarker} 'cause this is the {disfmarker} Th th there were different options we discussed then , user interface: No , we ha marketing: we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget . project manager: We just diske discuss it as you designed it marketing: Okay . project manager: and then we will will try to get it in the budget . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So the cost for these were {disfmarker} industrial designer: So {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: what was the cost for the first one ? Eight Euros ? project manager: Eight . industrial designer: Eight . Well actually we have yeah to check again yeah . user interface: Yeah , eight Euros yeah . marketing: And this one was sixteen Euros . project manager: Yes . industrial designer: Sixteen . user interface: Sixteen Euros . marketing: Okay . So . Innovation for this one is two ? One ? user interface: It's a two , I would say two {gap} . marketing: Two ? project manager: Two . industrial designer: W W un to be one what would do we nee actually , yeah , I don't see {disfmarker} project manager: Why it is one . industrial designer: okay , one would would be without buttons , {vocalsound} . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: A man {disfmarker} w w marketing: Mm . Well user interface: Yeah . marketing: the speech recognition is a very good innovation I believe it , project manager: Yes . industrial designer: Bu marketing: so {gap} industrial designer: Yeah . So maybe we can put one . project manager: This this is it w with the speech recognition ? industrial designer: It's using speech recognition , yeah . project manager: Well . user interface: Okay yeah . project manager: Gi given that {vocalsound} that it works , marketing: Give it a one ? industrial designer: Yeah , one , yeah . marketing: Yep . project manager: {vocalsound} then it's I think one . marketing: Okay . project manager: {gap} marketing: Ease of use ? user interface: {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: So the first one is really standard , marketing: Mm . industrial designer: so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it , user interface: He is used to it act marketing: Yeah . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: right ? user interface: They are used to it actually . marketing: Yep . So that's maybe a a two for ease of use . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Here there may {disfmarker} industrial designer: Um , the other one is quite easy , tho though . user interface: Uh , though it has more functionality I think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually . It shouldn't be diffi marketing: Okay . So maybe a three or a four . project manager: Hmm . user interface: Uh yeah , actually in fact I think it will be {disfmarker} industrial designer: One me um we hope {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker} industrial designer: maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons . marketing: Mm . user interface: Yeah but {vocalsound} y industrial designer: And there is a {disfmarker} like I would say three . Or maybe four {gap} . marketing: Okay . Consensus ? Three or four ? user interface: Well we have reduced the keys actually you see . project manager: Three , I would . Three . marketing: Three ? Okay . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah user interface: Three is fine with me . industrial designer: because it's n uh it's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so , {gap} {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah it's a {disfmarker} project manager: No . user interface: actually the user has to put some effort to do {disfmarker} use that actually , marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: it's not so easy , like this one the normal . project manager: Yeah . Yes but then when when he is used to it , i i it is quite easy . user interface: Is quite easy yeah . project manager: So so I think th three is good . Yeah . user interface: Initially there there is a lot of effort , yeah . marketing: Okay . project manager: Good . marketing: So three's project manager: What's the next ? marketing: uh how well it goes to the target demographic . So we're d we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds ? project manager: So {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . project manager: Twe twenty to forty , yes that's {disfmarker} marketing: That's {disfmarker} industrial designer: This one would be uh for grandmothers {vocalsound} . marketing: Mm . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Oh no , this would I industrial designer: No . user interface: I would I would give this model to the old people actually . industrial designer: Yeah , grandmothers , yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: So sh completely changed our demographic there , project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: And {disfmarker} marketing: it's not part of the the funky young thing . project manager: Well exce except for the surfing shape . I mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group I think , industrial designer: Yeah that's true . Yeah . marketing: Yeah . If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then I can imagine it being {disfmarker} applying to the the demographic project manager: but {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: yeah . That's {disfmarker} it's still {disfmarker} Ye project manager: Mm w w w we {disfmarker} after this we can can consider uh for instance , making this more attractive to to the demographic marketing: Mm . 'Cause we have got room , we've got some budget there to add a few things to it , project manager: Mm . marketing: that's right . project manager: But as it is now , I w would say mm , six , something . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Oh yeah , {gap} . marketing: And {disfmarker} project manager: Do you agree ? user interface: I {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah because it's so important {disfmarker} it's i it was written that it really so important , the um the the look and uh taking care of its {disfmarker} it targets , the right range of people , user interface: Well I think {disfmarker} marketing: Mm . industrial designer: right ? user interface: Yeah . Uh yeah but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap , actually . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: But it's going to be cheap whatever though , industrial designer: But w user interface: So {disfmarker} marketing: it was set with i we've got a set price . user interface: And people can still decide to use the cheaper one industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: instead of a {disfmarker} industrial designer: But for us it's {vocalsound} yeah {vocalsound} we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five Euros . project manager: Mm , yeah , indeed . marketing: Yeah . There's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few Euros on that one rather than another one . industrial designer: {gap} Yeah . project manager: Ju just think , twenty five Euros , I mean it's not going to be cheaper . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Okay . So in that case well it's fine then . marketing: Okay . Um project manager: Mm . Mm . Okay . user interface: We can {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: and the demokraphi demographic of the second one ? user interface: And the demographics of {disfmarker} marketing: It's got the got the the toys in it , it's got the L_C_D_ screen project manager: Yeah tha tha tha tha tha that's {disfmarker} marketing: and {disfmarker} project manager: I think it's better , marketing: Mm . project manager: because of the L_C_D_ screen which is really an appeal on the on the on the marketing: Yeah . project manager: on the {gap} and on the {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . And if you want to target {disfmarker} yeah if we we wish to to sell four millions of this , I think for this audience we need absolutely the L_C_D_ screen . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Mm . So , the L_C_D_ screen uh attracts , marketing: Yeah . project manager: yes . marketing: I think especially if we're gonna n have an L_C_D_ screen on a low range product then that's good . project manager: Because it {disfmarker} Mm , ma maybe that's something to consider , yes {vocalsound} , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm . Okay . project manager: so . Wh what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} marketing: I'd probably go with three again for that one . user interface: Yeah I think it's uh {disfmarker} it has more market actually . industrial designer: Or even {disfmarker} Even one and two . Or two . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: No s say t two . user interface: Y yeah , you know {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . So , two , yeah ? user interface: two . project manager: Two ? industrial designer: Yeah . Two yeah . user interface: Yeah two yeah . Because tomorrow this will be more appealing because you can add {vocalsound} lot of sophistication on that . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Because then you you have it uh d you have lot of things which you can include marketing: Yeah . Yep . And especially I guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well , user interface: for the people to {disfmarker} marketing: and that makes it more appealing , it's more of a a new fun toy . user interface: We have to practically test it . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: The field test will tell you how good . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Okay . project manager: Okay , the final point , trends . marketing: And following the trends . user interface: The trends . marketing: So the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel . project manager: Mm . Mm . {vocalsound} marketing: So as it is , not really doing either of them . project manager: I think {disfmarker} industrial designer: Spongy , uh , that means that it goes in in the water . {vocalsound} marketing: Well , project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well , user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: I know some {disfmarker} have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons and {disfmarker} not not exactly spongy but I'm thinking one of the Nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons industrial designer: Uh okay . marketing: it's got just a one bit on it project manager: Mm . user interface: Yeah I know . marketing: and so you can {disfmarker} that feels kinda spongy . industrial designer: But this one includes this feature , right ? Spongy buttons . marketing: So it's sort of , yeah . user interface: Yeah . We we we we we yeah , it's the way they are going to be , actually . marketing: Mm . Okay . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} Uh project manager: Mm . industrial designer: the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie . marketing: But that's if you're using the covers . project manager: And the then we can al marketing: Or is it just one {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: yes . We can {disfmarker} we can consider uh uh is it possible do you think , to to make a cover for s such a phone ? I mean {disfmarker} marketing: Well they make it for mobiles , it can't be that much more complicated . user interface: But why do you want to cover that actually ? In that uh w in the mod project manager: Well just with the with the flexible plastic uh {disfmarker} marketing: So you got the option of having different colours or different textures . industrial designer: Yeah . This is possible . project manager: I th I th I think {gap} {disfmarker} user interface: Uh uh y are you sure ? Yeah I think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone , yeah . project manager: O o or just two things which can be put on each other . marketing: Mm . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah exactly like Nokia phones {vocalsound} . marketing: Mm . project manager: {vocalsound} Yes , exactly like it . user interface: Yep . project manager: Uh , so Maybe we can {vocalsound} but we have to decide it , we can put the the {vocalsound} the fancy f look of vegetables for instance , to to these covers marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: and s now try to invest in the in in the features . marketing: I think the {disfmarker} if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics , it lets people have the latest fashion project manager: Mm . marketing: even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out , you'll still be able to put a new cover on it and then it'll still be in fashion . project manager: Mm mm mm mm mm . industrial designer: Yeah . 'Cause sometimes look at this computer , th this laptop , it's all black , marketing: Mm . industrial designer: and uh it's quite conventional , and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here . marketing: Mm . Mm . industrial designer: So maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one , very standard one , that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things . marketing: Mm . Yep . project manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . marketing: Yep . Mm . project manager: Mm . Mm . marketing: And then you have the option of having the different colours , different covers . project manager: Yes . So so so that that would make the trends equal , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: so we we we really have {disfmarker} don't have , marketing: Mm . There's n yeah . 'Cause that's the that's the feature that could be included in either of them . project manager: I mean {disfmarker} marketing: Although it is more with the spongy buttons on the um on the other one . project manager: Yes , indeed . industrial designer: Yeah , so a a point better for the for the number two {vocalsound} . marketing: Okay . So . Two and three , or one and two ? project manager: Yes . marketing: {gap} user interface: Yeah , it's one . project manager: Say , say one and two . One and two . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: So le le let's see . So d marketing: Okay . project manager: this one has spongy but buttons ? industrial designer: Yeah , the blue one uh spongy . user interface: Yeah , it says a {disfmarker} project manager: Mm , I see , yes okay . Good . marketing: Okay so the average of that is three six nine divided by five , so five {disfmarker} mm nine by five , one point s eight ? project manager: Just add it . industrial designer: Nine . project manager: You know . Three , six , seven . user interface: One point six , one point {disfmarker} industrial designer: {gap} user interface: One point eight yeah . marketing: This one , eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one , divided by five is four point two user interface: Four point {disfmarker} Uh four point two . marketing: yep . industrial designer: Very good . marketing: Okay . But we still got a very different price for those two so they're not really comparable yet anyway . project manager: Mm-hmm . We {disfmarker} we must try to get them closer . industrial designer: Yeah , it's right , yeah that's right . marketing: {vocalsound} Yep . project manager: Both in i i user interface: Wow . project manager: or we just have to choose . And adapt . marketing: Yep . project manager: Because , when we choose for this one we have to {vocalsound} we have to make it more attractive marketing: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . project manager: and w when we {gap} to d for this one we have to make it more cheap . marketing: Well it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out . project manager: {vocalsound} Yes , well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: That'll basically take us down to the budget . project manager: But I'm {vocalsound} now {disfmarker} did y did you work with the same prices that I have here ? industrial designer: So I I give yeah I just give a call with the manufacturer uh and uh I explained them and they told me this could be possible for sixteen Fr Euros . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: Uh unfortunately we didn't see this chip , uh Matthew , user interface: Yeah . Yep . project manager: Mm , tha industrial designer: so maybe we have to recap with this one . user interface: Maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this , yeah . project manager: Well yes , well uh re reconsider it . So {vocalsound} let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet , user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: uh what kind of energy source uh I I {disfmarker} we didn't speak about that . It's a {disfmarker} it's a normal battery , or {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , it migh It {disfmarker} it'll need uh more than a conventional one , it won't be uh just {disfmarker} maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually . What do you say , Mael ? industrial designer: For this one it's a normal battery {gap} . project manager: Yes . Just so one battery . 'Kay . Electronics . {gap} given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Uh sample speaker , yeah . project manager: Yeah , yes , or sample sensor , yes . industrial designer: Sample , yeah , this one . project manager: Yes , this one . Okay . Case ? Um , industrial designer: So {disfmarker} user interface: Curved . Double curved yeah right . project manager: {vocalsound} I see {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I user interface: It's uh {disfmarker} marketing: Mm . project manager: Double curve . marketing: Yeah , it's gonna be more than just the biggest case , definitely . project manager: {gap} Mm . industrial designer: So which one are we talking to ? user interface: Are you talking about this or that ? industrial designer: Well {disfmarker} marketing: Either of them . project manager: Oh yes , we are talking about , but they have the same shape , user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Mm . They're both going to be not basic cases . project manager: but , actually bu industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So th th this would be double curves ? marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . project manager: 'Kay . Uh , plastic would be the material . marketing: Yeah . The basic one , yep . industrial designer: Is it zero Franc ? {vocalsound} user interface: A special colour ? {vocalsound} project manager: Uh special colour , now we leave it to the covers . user interface: Uh {disfmarker} marketing: So now we're either going button or L_C_D_s , L_C_D_ display . project manager: Push . Mm , yes , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: L_C_D_ is {gap} . It's okay . Just say L_C_D_ {gap} . marketing: Is that price per unit , or for the whole thing ? project manager: Yeah th now this is per per unit , this number of components . user interface: Ah good . marketing: So it would need twelve buttons . user interface: Yeah , we might need a scroll wheel , right , for that ? industrial designer: No but for this one it's twelve Euro . user interface: No , for that one also . industrial designer: There are twelve ? project manager: So , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , user interface: Yeah that's a scroll . project manager: t Yes . Twelve I believe . So this comes to eighteen . marketing: Mm . And that's without any special button supplements . user interface: Yeah , one scroll wheel you might need . project manager: So {disfmarker} marketing: So we'd have a special colour , special form and special material on all of them . They're not just standard buttons . user interface: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: So I think {disfmarker} but th do you agree th that thi industrial designer: Wait a minute , it's not it's not double curved , it's single curved , right ? Because it's {disfmarker} there is no like {vocalsound} . marketing: But I thought it would be curved on two {disfmarker} project manager: Yes I marketing: it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well , that's what I thought . project manager: Yes I'm I'm no I'm no I'm not sh sure . industrial designer: Well project manager: Yes I kno undes I understand what you mean , yes . industrial designer: it's {gap} you know this curve like this so , it's w there is only is is is there is nothing like y you know in the other stuff there are {disfmarker} marketing: You talking about concave curves ? project manager: Uh-huh . industrial designer: yeah concave . project manager: Both . industrial designer: So I think we can put um {disfmarker} marketing: You think a single curved ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} the single curved in the sixteen . That makes uh seventeen . And what are just {disfmarker} The bt buttons , we have twelve buttons , are you sure ? Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Mm . project manager: Yes . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} marketing: We have more , we've got those {disfmarker} the scroll wheel on the side industrial designer: So marketing: and yeah {disfmarker} industrial designer: I had a bad uh bad estimation . user interface: Bad estimate , marketing: The sc project manager: W {vocalsound} d {vocalsound} user interface: right ? project manager: we have {disfmarker} we haven't talk about a {gap} , but that's no a {gap} is very exp inexpensive I believe marketing: Mm . project manager: but it is not in the list . marketing: We've got a scroll wheel for the volume don't we , or is it some other thing that's not on there . project manager: W ho h is this a scroll wheel or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides uh so for higher and lower ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: No no no . marketing: 'Kay we've only got five minutes left guys so we need to wrap it up pretty fast . industrial designer: Yes , a kind of scroll wheel . marketing: So this is even more than the um than the cost you gave , the sixteen Euros . project manager: Mm . Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Okay , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: so based on that , yeah , um where is the es okay sample speaker {disfmarker} user interface: That is the sample sensor and sample speaker . project manager: So {disfmarker} um {disfmarker} industrial designer: But still , yeah it {gap} user interface: We just need that actually . We need one . project manager: We're {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip , but then we can't have the the speech recognition , yes ? Yes ? industrial designer: No we cannot , yeah . project manager: So so w when we w a industrial designer: So {disfmarker} user interface: S project manager: this would this would be cutting the speech recognition . industrial designer: But the um {disfmarker} Yeah but if you have the {disfmarker} near the L_C_D_ you can um {vocalsound} choose {disfmarker} select between um you know like uni universal between audio , T_V_ and V_C_R_ , and this needs a needs a advanced chip . project manager: Transti industrial designer: Right , Matthew ? user interface: Oh I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i it {disfmarker} industrial designer: Or regular chip ? user interface: I think it's going to be {disfmarker} y y industrial designer: I think yeah regular , today we you can do that with regular chip . user interface: yeah it's th with the regular chip , yeah . project manager: Say {gap} say it's regular , regular chip , industrial designer: Yeah . Okay . Okay . project manager: and we still on fifteen , user interface: Yeah . project manager: so {disfmarker} industrial designer: So . And what about the number of buttons buttons uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} my Matthew ? project manager: Yes but that {disfmarker} maybe {disfmarker} Well we can just say user interface: Uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: {gap} project manager: one . industrial designer: When you look at this w , this u uh item , {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Ca l we are just {disfmarker} when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty . industrial designer: But {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: So is it possible ? marketing: {vocalsound} But that's seven basic buttons right , seven buttons without any adds-on , without special colours or form or material . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: That'll be {disfmarker} then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times . industrial designer: You cannot make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really {vocalsound} really low , project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: No no , marketing: Well {disfmarker} project manager: he he he I I industrial designer: no ? user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: So {gap} the L_C_D_ display is is three Francs , sorry three Euros , by itself . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: And uh we don't want to to change that right ? We we really want a L_C_D_ user interface: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market . project manager: Otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal uh thing like this . industrial designer: It's evident . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So twelve Euro fifty , we got two off of the battery , industrial designer: And I dunno {disfmarker} marketing: we can't do anything about that , so ten fifty , if we want an L_C_D_ dispra display , that's seven fifty um , so we've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons . And the chip . project manager: Mm . marketing: Sorry the chip's up there already . project manager: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . marketing: So we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget , there's no doubt about that . project manager: {vocalsound} A industrial designer: So wha what what each of us think about the {disfmarker} because it's measure point the L_C_D_ , um {disfmarker} Do you think it's important ? user interface: Or we could even replace them by buttons actually . industrial designer: Because sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact , you have a big display and maybe you don't need one more in your hands ? I dunno , I'm just asking . marketing: Mm . project manager: Mm {disfmarker} user interface: A actually it depends , it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it , marketing: Yep . user interface: for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , or {disfmarker} and you'll have L_C_D_ display which is {disfmarker} that is going to bring the cost by two two Euros at least . marketing: Mm . Yeah . I think , unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display . user interface: Okay so we can get rid of it industrial designer: Yeah , it's true yeah . user interface: and then add a couple of buttons . industrial designer: But uh , do we want that ? On the market point of view , yeah . What do you think uh , L_C_D_ is a major feature , or ? project manager: Mm . I marketing: For the price , it's gonna be what we can afford , and it's looking like we can't afford the L_C_D_ display , there's no way we can get it in there . {vocalsound} Mm . project manager: I {gap} think we have to come to a decision now , just I I think we we what we just do i is vote about the uh the L_C_D_ uh display marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: so {disfmarker} industrial designer: You assume , you want a democratic voyt vote , project manager: Yes . industrial designer: right ? Okay . project manager: Yes . Yes . {vocalsound} One man one vote . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} S so who thinks the the L_C_D_ disply display should be i should be in it ? marketing: I th I'd like t it to be in but I can't see it happening . I can't see it fitting in . project manager: Mm . Mm-hmm mm-hmm . {vocalsound} user interface: I think but {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} We need to be . {vocalsound} marketing: Bu y you're a power voter {disfmarker} uh veto anyway as Project Manager . project manager: Mm-hmm , I know , but {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . {gap} . user interface: Yeah but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that . marketing: {gap} well we have to make a decision now , that's it . project manager: Yes . user interface: Yeah . project manager: So uh uh having an L_C_D_ s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons . Is that acceptable ? Ca can I have {disfmarker} can the functions be implement in an {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes . project manager: You've {disfmarker} you you agree . user interface: W I I I just {disfmarker} project manager: So hav hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve . user interface: Yeah . project manager: So that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons {vocalsound} . industrial designer: Because one yeah th show me that uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here . Here one , at the middle , and at the bottom . project manager: Mm . marketing: Mm . I think then we we're really losing ease of use . industrial designer: Okay , {gap} . user interface: That will create another problem . For the people to use it . It's not going to be easy . Doing that . marketing: Okay . project manager: Mm . So um industrial designer: Okay . project manager: I I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen . That that's that's my opinion . user interface: No , it's okay , you uh cut the L_C_D_ screen project manager: Just {disfmarker} user interface: and introduce two more buttons . marketing: Okay . So L_C_D_'s out , is speech rec out now ? We've {disfmarker} industrial designer: The speech recognition is out . Because of the budget , yeah . marketing: Yep . project manager: Uh where , L_C_ {disfmarker} marketing: Yep . project manager: Okay w we now we can just uh {disfmarker} marketing: So are we basically back to the original one now , back to the first version ? Which turns out to be on budget exactly , pretty much . With these new costings . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes . marketing: So {gap} just look at {disfmarker} forget that one and look at that one now . project manager: Yes . Yes . I th I th I think w we just go for this one industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm . project manager: and that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price , marketing: Yep . project manager: okay . marketing: Okay . Well that's that's {disfmarker} project manager: My m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected . marketing: Yep . industrial designer: Actually yeah , marketing: So . industrial designer: we we we will not need the really uh expert designers um because the amount , yeah . marketing: Mm . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yep . So w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe project manager: Okay . marketing: and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment . project manager: Okay , good . Then we {gap} the same . Thank you . user interface: Okay . project manager: That was it . {vocalsound} marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Thanks . user interface: That's it . Cool . marketing: Okay .
