industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control . user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} So {gap} . {vocalsound} So let's see the {disfmarker} what did you prepare . user interface: Yeah , so can you go out to the shared folder ? Mm the shared folder . project manager: Sh share folder for th your presentation ? user interface: Yes . We have a presentation . project manager: Because I have here {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {gap} So I got the participant uh three . W uh {vocalsound} . Three . It's the final design , yeah . project manager: Okay just one {gap} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} S so so I discussed with Guillaume . industrial designer: Mm . {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: Right . {vocalsound} And uh {vocalsound} so we have {vocalsound} {disfmarker} and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . So we come up with two versions . One with and one without L_C_D_s . Um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or {gap} control module . And detachable big buttons for all people um . So {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes {vocalsound} . Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display . You you can s here . And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: You can uh choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function . user interface: Mm . Mm-hmm . industrial designer: You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the {vocalsound} for the speech recognition system here . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: And here the the switch that control if you want {disfmarker} project manager: Why you why you you put it in the the side ? industrial designer: Well I I I think uh it's the {disfmarker} project manager: It's not a good place maybe {gap} . industrial designer: Yeah but {disfmarker} user interface: No i i it's the all around camer uh microphone isn't it . The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? industrial designer: Well so it's a microphone array . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Oh it's very costly , microphone array {vocalsound} . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} No user interface: Yeah {vocalsound} industrial designer: it's just a single microphone , and you {disfmarker} I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . user interface: Yeah {vocalsound} yeah . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off . And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger . project manager: How much does it cost this one ? industrial designer: Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars user interface: For the {disfmarker} project manager: Fifteen dollars ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} fifteen dollars , project manager: Ah it's above it's above the budget . industrial designer: but uh well it's not it's not uh {disfmarker} yeah , but uh it's just a prototype and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh {disfmarker} voila . marketing: The cost would be le reduced . industrial designer: Yeah the {gap} and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars . {gap} user interface: Mm . Hmm . project manager: How many b battery is there ? industrial designer: How many , excuse me ? project manager: Battery . industrial designer: Well uh f battery , we use uh about uh {disfmarker} user interface: Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: A_A_ rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: Rechargeable of course , user interface: Yeah rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: because we have the charger . user interface: We have the charger so it's no problem . industrial designer: Yeah and you just {disfmarker} project manager: So one one battery ? industrial designer: On uh yeah one battery . marketing: Is that two or one ? user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: It's kinetic reserve . user interface: {vocalsound} Actually uh it's a flexible thing . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: You just n uh {disfmarker} marketing: Now what is the whole day rating for that ? industrial designer: The {disfmarker} excuse me ? marketing: Whole day's rating . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: What type of battery ? industrial designer: Oh yeah it's just a r uh simple battery a rechargeable uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah yeah . industrial designer: if you uh like it's exist . marketing: Something like a two A_ , A_ three size batteries ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah {vocalsound} . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger user interface: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: and uh leave it uh alone , it's alright . user interface: Mm . {vocalsound} At uh {vocalsound} yeah . industrial designer: Then the next time you pick it , oh project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: it works {vocalsound} . user interface: I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , b this button {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah just explain the button uh Norman . user interface: yeah alright . This button is like the mouse {disfmarker} is like a joystick , industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it {disfmarker} the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button {vocalsound} . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . So a swing to the left , a swing to the right defines other functions . So even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement {vocalsound} . marketing: And the L_C_D_ is this one , on the remote ? user interface: Yeah . This is the version y that comes with L_C_D_ . industrial designer: Yep . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months of function is {gap} getting destroyed . user interface: Mm . project manager: If you user interface: Uh okay this is new prototype uh {vocalsound} . project manager: {gap} {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah it's {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . The second version is also simpler , we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also {vocalsound} . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So basically th it's the same uh {disfmarker} marketing: Uh-huh and also the switch . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: yeah {vocalsound} . marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before . But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . Press one button uh acting as a a enter button . user interface: Mm . {vocalsound} industrial designer: So um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: And uh it's also cheaper to produce . We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars . {vocalsound} project manager: No four dollars , it's {vocalsound} {gap} good . {gap} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , user interface: Oh no marketing: because that's a major that's a {disfmarker} user interface: th actually th we'll come to that point in our {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah it's it's it's embed in the uh speech recognition system . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Okay industrial designer: So {disfmarker} marketing: and if you disable speech recognition system then ? user interface: W w I'll I'll come to that point later on . industrial designer: {vocalsound} so Norman will explain to you {vocalsound} . marketing: Mm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm . project manager: And we will we will serve the charger with this ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah yeah of course mm {gap} . user interface: Th they {vocalsound} either these with the {disfmarker} uh the the charger any project manager: With the remote control . user interface: in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah . project manager: Okay so the price of the charger included in the {disfmarker} user interface: Uh it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price uh {vocalsound} . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Thank thank you {vocalsound} . project manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} industrial designer: And so mm-hmm . user interface: It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but uh again depends on the types . I think we have to investigate more on that , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: The price should be below twelve and a half Euro . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah project manager: Well that's {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} user interface: but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to {disfmarker} people are willing to pay more for good design . project manager: We have we have just {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah people are willing to pay more , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment . project manager: The price of selling is twenty five Euros . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . project manager: And the price of production {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Alright please uh go on Norman with the special features {vocalsound} . marketing: Or uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: so is uh modular . project manager: That's for this basis function and if you want more you pay more . user interface: Yeah yeah , project manager: {gap} user interface: for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it {disfmarker} put it back in , or you can use the other one , marketing: Something like customised . Yeah project manager: Yeah . user interface: or {vocalsound} the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: You want a microphone to put in the {vocalsound} speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . marketing: Mm hmm hmm hmm . project manager: {gap} user interface: So {disfmarker} marketing: Hmm okay . user interface: It's pretty flexible in the yeah price {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {gap} You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control project manager: But {disfmarker} user interface: Uh yeah yeah you should present that . industrial designer: that that you ca you can add up {vocalsound} to the {disfmarker} to your remote control marketing: And this is other one ? user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up {disfmarker} they come up with their modules , marketing: Mm hmm hmm hmm . industrial designer: they just plug in it user interface: Yeah {vocalsound} industrial designer: and they can have all the control they want here . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , user interface: Hmm . {vocalsound} industrial designer: and it acts like the previous one , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: you just plug in and it works . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful . Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with {vocalsound} the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities . But in addition with simplicity . So that's the best idea , the cond that that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here {vocalsound} . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you . The first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . And then we also have security feature for example this here {disfmarker} oop {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: it's very robust {gap} , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ? industrial designer: The titanium project manager: Titanium . industrial designer: and so it's very uh {disfmarker} user interface: Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . marketing: Yeah that's fine . user interface: Lithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . So when you finish watching your T_V_ {vocalsound} and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ , uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , so so that's the {disfmarker} or is it {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . user interface: that's the reminder part . Yeah and um {disfmarker} And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define marketing: Mm hmm hmm hmm . user interface: so {disfmarker} sorry ? {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a {gap} of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children . So instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the T_V_ contents of the night . So it's pretty powerful , and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . Yeah . And {vocalsound} and for the materials that is cheap to produce I think uh it's quite clear from {disfmarker} yeah {vocalsound} . project manager: {gap} user interface: And also like the {gap} and the fancy designs yeah . project manager: What what's {disfmarker} user interface: Maybe we can improve more on the design but {vocalsound} project manager: Maybe yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: What's the price to p to produce ? user interface: {disfmarker} uh this is the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well so the price to produce {disfmarker} For uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . project manager: With with with the charge ? industrial designer: Uh it's about it {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} without without the charger marketing: With the charger ? project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah {vocalsound} industrial designer: it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger . So if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the L_C_D_ {vocalsound} , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: We don't have charger . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} I think we can use Excel {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} It's about {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: We don't have all the options {vocalsound} . industrial designer: so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars . project manager: Charger we don't have charger here either . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: No it's industrial designer: But it's just if you want all functionalities . project manager: it's below the the the budget . user interface: Yeah {vocalsound} . industrial designer: Excuse me ? project manager: It's below the bu the budget . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah it's a nice input project manager: We {disfmarker} marketing: but we have an other inputs from the l public demands . project manager: {gap} marketing: I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: I think we can just go to my presentation then . We can wind up . Or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and uh in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is {disfmarker} first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold . user interface: {vocalsound} Mm . marketing: And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . And the third one is easy to use . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons . marketing: Okay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find {disfmarker} these are the latest fashion updates , and so this {disfmarker} in Paris and Milan {gap} they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . user interface: Spongy spongy . Mm mm . marketing: So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes . user interface: Mm {vocalsound} mm . marketing: And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy . user interface: But the the problem is that uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} is it robust to mishandling ? industrial designer: Okay . user interface: We have {disfmarker} you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy {vocalsound} . industrial designer: A sponge . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah so uh {vocalsound} so finally we have these three criterias . user interface: Spongy {vocalsound} . marketing: One is fancy look , second is innovative , and third is easy to use . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} So these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: So {disfmarker} and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , industrial designer: Hmm . marketing: say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven , user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ , user interface: Mm . marketing: so on this scale , if it is true , if it is {disfmarker} if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn't {disfmarker} it looks uh {disfmarker} it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . So {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} So {gap} marketing: {vocalsound} We can make our study on this and {disfmarker} user interface: so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ? marketing: No no we have {disfmarker} you have designed two products now , project manager: Yeah . marketing: one is with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ? project manager: You . marketing: According to you , no according to you designers , how will feel {disfmarker} does it uh with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ? user interface: Mm . marketing: Okay let us make this L_ and without L_C_D_ . On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control . How do you look {disfmarker} how does it look ? user interface: Mm . Mm . marketing: D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ? industrial designer: Well it doesn't look much fancy I'll I'll say three or four . marketing: And you both agree for that ? project manager: And you ? user interface: {vocalsound} I think we can improve on the design . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh {gap} {vocalsound} design . industrial designer: Yeah . It's it it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Um we have been focused all all this {vocalsound} time on the {vocalsound} on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . industrial designer: Technical aspects . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: As for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help {vocalsound} . marketing: So I take three on {disfmarker} with L_C_D_ ? industrial designer: Yeah a three . marketing: So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ? user interface: Yeah {vocalsound} . industrial designer: Uh four . I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated marketing: Four . industrial designer: so removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: And in the sense of innovativeness , with L_C_D_ . industrial designer: Well it's it's the same for both so {vocalsound} I will give a five , six . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Mm . {vocalsound} marketing: Five with L_C_D_ and {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well five also uh {disfmarker} Norman please . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah {vocalsound} project manager: Uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um {vocalsound} the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , because uh that is really innovative , and for now {disfmarker} and another innovation we have is simplicity and {disfmarker} simplicity , few buttons , we've uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} A lot of functionalities . industrial designer: With lot of functionalities . user interface: So that is uh that is uh for both th marketing: So without L_C_D_ ? user interface: Our gi I think that the our our product is uh has the best in all {disfmarker} well this is a biased judgement {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: because we designed them . marketing: No no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ? user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} Uh the innovation is v is very high I think . project manager: For L_C_D_ . marketing: With L_C_D_ . user interface: Both . marketing: And without L_C_D_ ? industrial designer: Mm for both it's the the same innovations . user interface: For both . It's the same innovation . So maybe I can put six to seven . marketing: Okay . industrial designer: {gap} six , let's go for six . project manager: Without L_C_D_ . user interface: Both . marketing: No actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts . So I {disfmarker} there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness . user interface: Mm . project manager: Uh no innovative yeah . user interface: Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ? marketing: So we can't go {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Talk about {disfmarker} user interface: We haven't really uh determined {vocalsound} what are {disfmarker} actually actually project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: I mean that what you are sayin that's what the design {disfmarker} user interface: it's good to have a L_C_D_ but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_ ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: No it's like this , project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: I mean on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . project manager: So let's remove it . user interface: Yeah ? Yeah . Yeah but {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah project manager: But {disfmarker} industrial designer: but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen . marketing: Uh then {disfmarker} user interface: Yes exactly . project manager: This is the problem . marketing: No on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now . industrial designer: If you have the L_C_D_ , but if n marketing: L_C_D_ ? Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a user interface: But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ . marketing: I mean that depends upon your design , so {disfmarker} user interface: Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ {vocalsound} we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ , marketing: I mean {disfmarker} user interface: we give what the customer uh wants , right . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? And which {gap} do you recommend e easy to use , with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_ ? user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons , user interface: Yeah {vocalsound} industrial designer: and uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: so I will give a six for the easy to use . user interface: Yeah I think {disfmarker} project manager: No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ . user interface: sorry . {vocalsound} project manager: Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price , marketing: Yeah . project manager: and I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates . So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition . Even then our product is going to be very good . industrial designer: Yeah , it's cheaper to produce . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Mm . {vocalsound} S {vocalsound} industrial designer: And uh if the the {disfmarker} well if we have less technology we have more liberty to uh for the shape and uh things like that so {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah that's right . user interface: Yeah . I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated industrial designer: Yep . user interface: because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . For kids they want simply the {gap} s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , marketing: Yeah yeah that's right . user interface: so that's why {vocalsound} we have the parental module . Uh we can ha have {disfmarker} build a more complex design if if they want it , but but uh what I'm trying to say here is that the um {disfmarker} we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . So in terms of easy to use I think it's very user customisable . User customisation is very important yeah . Yeah industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: so {vocalsound} {disfmarker} industrial designer: Six . marketing: So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ? project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: W uh {disfmarker} marketing: Or you want it to be six ? user interface: I think it's the same . industrial designer: Um six . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes as you say , with better uh {vocalsound} project manager: Without L_C_D_ . marketing: S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ . industrial designer: {disfmarker} yeah . And to improve the the look . marketing: As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also , user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Mm . marketing: and it's going to be much simpler to use . industrial designer: Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: so let's go back to our laboratory and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} To improve on the design . project manager: What a what what about the sys speech recognition ? marketing: So . project manager: {gap} what about the integration of speech recognition ? user interface: Huh ? The speech recogniser is a add-on module . Right ? industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: That's going to be an optional . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: If somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Ah so it's optional with the {disfmarker} okay . marketing: It's an optional . industrial designer: It's optional yeah , since well according to this study uh people more {vocalsound} likes more to have a spongy uh {vocalsound} remote control than {disfmarker} project manager: I think it will be {disfmarker} I think i user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , but I mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module project manager: Yeah . Or ma yeah . marketing: and so that their parents can't use it {vocalsound} . project manager: Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , industrial designer: {gap} project manager: so mayb better if you have all this in the same {disfmarker} marketing: In the same set , yeah , project manager: {gap} marketing: and and individual buttons to make them work . project manager: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children {disfmarker} {vocalsound} when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . So we might lose the customer because of this . I don't know , project manager: So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional {disfmarker} uh will be optional . user interface: what do you think uh ? Yes exa what do you think , I don't know . You are Marketing Manag {vocalsound} . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} marketing: I mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that uh how many married couple {disfmarker} or how many couples have a T_V_ user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: or to the number or singles who have a television . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So based on that I think {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? {vocalsound} project manager: I think it inc increase . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well you can {gap} {disfmarker} if you had uh something li project manager: I think it i increases . industrial designer: Oh no , project manager: {gap} industrial designer: because if you if you add uh something {disfmarker} well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but {disfmarker} project manager: Hmm . marketing: But you can make it on a single P_C_ with three different options . industrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the {vocalsound} functionalities um on the same module , but uh {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . {vocalsound} Mm . Yeah . marketing: On the same P_C_B_ user interface: Well well the other aspect is that if {vocalsound} in the {disfmarker} when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the {disfmarker} you're gonna keep the same customer , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: yeah yeah . user interface: because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons . marketing: Yeah that's right . user interface: So so {disfmarker} marketing: I mean you could just provide with an optional {gap} . user interface: Yeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . So in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again and again . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: So it's something like a Microsoft product {vocalsound} update . project manager: {vocalsound} And and we we we we we we don't want that . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} We're not trying to follow the Microsoft and we don't want to the m {gap} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Updates and we sell it . We make updates and sell it {gap} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be {disfmarker} can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , it depends on the v production . {vocalsound} marketing: And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ? industrial designer: Well so {disfmarker} marketing: Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? industrial designer: Yeah yeah marketing: Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and {disfmarker} industrial designer: I think we are {vocalsound} {disfmarker} yeah but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape and um {disfmarker} but I don't think it will uh increase the cost too much so {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . marketing: Or uh it could be like this {disfmarker} the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Uh well but it's a bit complicated to {disfmarker} if if if you need machines to {disfmarker} different machines to um ah well {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . What we can change is to propose the {vocalsound} customers with skins . For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin marketing: Yeah , yeah that's right . user interface: and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better . industrial designer: Yeah yeah we can have the same global shape user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah that's right . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah you can pl in what material would that be in uh ? industrial designer: Sponge . {vocalsound} marketing: I think you need to look into the material . user interface: Yeah or furry like a pet dog kind of thing {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah yeah . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: So we finished the prototype uh presentation if you have uh something else to say . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models . project manager: {gap} Project evaluation project satisfaction , for example . I don't know , we have to ask these question . We have to give answers so {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {gap} I suppose that you {gap} this criteria , is it ? project manager: {vocalsound} Project evaluation . {gap} user interface: {vocalsound} Room for creativity . This room is a bit small , but {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} but I think it's okay for us to work with . {vocalsound} marketing: I feel it's fine , we know we don't need uh {disfmarker} I think it's okay . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah mm . industrial designer: That was good . marketing: This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations . user interface: Mm . Yeah anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so it's okay . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: And the leadership was excellent . project manager: Yeah I think so {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Good job {vocalsound} good job . industrial designer: Fine yes uh {vocalsound} project manager: He gave you the liberty to talk as you wants {vocalsound} . marketing: Yeah that's right .

We achieved uh project goal I think . marketing: Yeah project manager: De marketing: that is within the budget . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Mm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} It's w yes , more or less . marketing: And the evaluation was {disfmarker} project manager: Without without L_C_D_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple . marketing: Yeah that's right . industrial designer: Yeah but {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Alright .
