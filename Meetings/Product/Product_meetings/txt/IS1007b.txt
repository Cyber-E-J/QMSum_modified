project manager: So we come again for the the second meeting . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about uh the work for each one . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: And {gap} take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . user interface: Okay . {vocalsound} project manager: And we have {disfmarker} think I got a new project requirement . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: So I think uh teletext becomes outdated . So the popularity of the {disfmarker} since the popularity of the internet , industrial designer: Okay . project manager: and I think we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television . And of course we should have our image {gap} in the in the design . So , let's start with the the industrial designer . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , alright . project manager: Or y you can use the whiteboard if you want . industrial designer: So uh {disfmarker} Well I have a PowerPoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder project manager: Here . industrial designer: so I I I think you can reach it from here . marketing: Just go to explorer . project manager: Oh okay . marketing: Or open . Participant two . industrial designer: Participant two . project manager: This one . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Open uh . industrial designer: Uh open . {vocalsound} project manager: Do you want to open {disfmarker} user interface: Because it's open you mean . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Right , so um I will talk about the the w working design and {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} F_ five . marketing: Slide show , view slide show , {gap} . project manager: Ah . industrial designer: And um well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the {disfmarker} our new remote control for television . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So uh can you go one page down , please . So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So uh mm I'm thin uh {vocalsound} I think uh I I'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible {vocalsound} things we hav we can use . Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh with uh h how this little box {vocalsound} would uh look look like . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that . Okay so can you go down uh {disfmarker} So , wha what I think {vocalsound} for now {vocalsound} is {vocalsound} we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the {gap} . Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication . And the communication with the T_V_ set is uh made through uh infrared communication So uh this is the {vocalsound} the schema of the {vocalsound} o of the future uh remote controls user interface: Did you draw it ? {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Wow . {vocalsound} industrial designer: so uh you can you can see the components , uh battery and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the T_V_ set . user interface: This {gap} . project manager: This {disfmarker} user interface: What is the other chip for ? The one on top . industrial designer: The one on top is for the um {disfmarker} well the functionali the functionalities user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: One is a communication . industrial designer: and the the th red um {disfmarker} sorry the green one is is to {disfmarker} well , putting things together , um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to {gap} uh to communicate with the T_V_ set . user interface: For men . To the {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: And , that's it . I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for {vocalsound} for the functionalities which is easy to to t user interface: Mm . What is F_P_G_A_ ? industrial designer: It's field programmable uh something array . marketing: {vocalsound} Gateway arrays . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: It's a field programmable gateway arrays . user interface: So why's it {disfmarker} how is it different from the Bluetooth ? industrial designer: Well , uh a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can uh you can {gap} pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want . user interface: Yeah . Programme it . marketing: Yeah {gap} . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: And uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} So this are the {disfmarker} they have to work together ? Or ? Do they have to work together or two separate choice {disfmarker} industrial designer: No . Well , th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send . user interface: Okay . marketing: Or it's something like {disfmarker} isn't hardware the first one ? And the second one is for the software . user interface: Is the is the software par alri okay . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah to run th to make it run . user interface: Okay , okay . marketing: That's it . user interface: So you can control {gap} if you want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah {vocalsound} . marketing: No . industrial designer: Alright and that's it for the working design . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So if you have any questions ? user interface: Mm . marketing: Okay , and how about the battery power ? Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? industrial designer: Uh no no no no , I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the {disfmarker} project manager: {gap} . marketing: Into the {vocalsound} industrial designer: yeah into the t . marketing: more compact and uh {disfmarker} okay , {gap} industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: And uh I I don't think it will need um {vocalsound} very uh much power to make it run , so {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Mm . Mm . marketing: Yeah , yeah . Okay . user interface: Mm . You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it . industrial designer: Yeah . It's a good idea . marketing: Yeah , that's right . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always . user interface: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out . user interface: Yeah . Mm . Uh {disfmarker} mm . marketing: We just make a small charger user interface: Y yeah , yeah . marketing: and put it {disfmarker} project manager: You can i yeah . user interface: Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ? industrial designer: That's a good idea . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Ma industrial designer: Also , but but {vocalsound} I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote {vocalsound} control . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} I dunno . {vocalsound} marketing: Bu {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah we can change the b {gap} . marketing: Our remote , project manager: Yeah . marketing: we do not want to make it P_D_A_ . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} S {vocalsound} okay , so charger for {gap} is the {gap} . project manager: Um . user interface: {vocalsound} So is mine . project manager: It's mine . Participant one , no ? user interface: Oh . Yeah , this your {disfmarker} project manager: Mm . Oh we have {gap} so let's move to to user interface design {gap} . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} So you can open uh {vocalsound} project manager: Participant {disfmarker} user interface: three . Yeah . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} So I'm working on the technical functions design . {gap} can you show the next slide . So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . So {vocalsound} so I found on a webs on the internet project manager: {vocalsound} During the weekend . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} I spent a lot of time searching {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: That's good . {vocalsound} user interface: and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: {vocalsound} For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on . marketing: G user interface: So I found two very good prototypes for {vocalsound} for this interface from our competitors industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: so can you {vocalsound} {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: This are usual functionality {gap} . user interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah . Ours is a bit uh different . So these are two example . One is from {vocalsound} {gap} the other one is from , yeah , uh engineering centr yeah . project manager: Tasks . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: This is the most competing prototypes I've found {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: But then uh loo but then I found if you look at {disfmarker} you see on the left one there are too many buttons {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: And they are small {gap} . user interface: Yeah . O on the right I tried to play with {vocalsound} the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: so it's very lousy . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: {vocalsound} So you {vocalsound} so you move to the next the next one . industrial designer: Of course . user interface: Yeah , so I talk about the problem . And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick , so we don't want that . project manager: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} So I propose the easy to use uh prototype . You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can {gap} the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end {disfmarker} in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some {disfmarker} to do some preprocessing . From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the {vocalsound} on the remote controller , right ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} And then we {disfmarker} the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in {disfmarker} we may K_I_V_ . project manager: What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ user interface: Yeah , all the processing is done {disfmarker} the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: than the {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} So we have to t project manager: So we should have specific T_V_ ? Or ? We can use this . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , we don't {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah because {disfmarker} {vocalsound} are you just wondering what controller {disfmarker} okay . project manager: Yeah , I think so . J j just the remote control . marketing: Yeah , not the T_V_s . industrial designer: I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because {disfmarker} user interface: Okay . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: Yeah , that's right . project manager: Mm . user interface: So i the processing on on the remote controller {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , user interface: so it can u be used in any T_V_ , any conventional T_V_ sets ? project manager: we {gap} . Yeah . user interface: Mm . Okay . {vocalsound} project manager: Speech recognition . user interface: N yeah , that's all . The next one ? So I come up with a simple design , just keep the v navigation buttons . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yes , that's a good idea , I think . project manager: Keep the navigation industrial designer: We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to {disfmarker} i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: but {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well , f four five buttons , it's sufficient . user interface: Yeah . Mm . industrial designer: It's easy to build , user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: it does not consume much power . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , that's right . project manager: {gap} . user interface: {vocalsound} Okay , that's all . {vocalsound} marketing: Oh , but you have a catch there , um assume that um if you want to go to {disfmarker} if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then {vocalsound} . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well , then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel user interface: Mm . industrial designer: and then uh you {gap} can {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . No , because you choose by channel , so {disfmarker} you choose by T_V_ program industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Uh-huh huh huh huh . industrial designer: Maybe you {disfmarker} user interface: so you don't have hundred channels to choose from . If you go by channel , you don't have to do that . industrial designer: {gap} . marketing: Mm-hmm hmm hmm . industrial designer: {gap} but uh I I think i i {gap} if you if you want to to make uh {disfmarker} well a a big jump {vocalsound} {gap} but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could {disfmarker} marketing: But {disfmarker} project manager: So you are {disfmarker} user interface: Ah . Ah , a big jump . marketing: Yeah then yeah that's right . user interface: A mouse or {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well , not a mouse but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or {disfmarker} marketing: Mm hmm hmm . Okay . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: So , marketing: Okay . user interface: Mm . {vocalsound} industrial designer: we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: How the {gap} this remote ? industrial designer: But we'll see . {vocalsound} user interface: Uh it's gonna be small . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , of course {vocalsound} small . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . So it'll beep if you wanna find it marketing: {vocalsound} {gap} too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: you just uh shout {disfmarker} y h just {disfmarker} it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: that's {gap} . user interface: {vocalsound} I dunno how bu {vocalsound} marketing: {gap} just {gap} give it a name and we call him . user interface: {vocalsound} And {gap} responds to you , and {gap} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's right . Yeah , that's right . industrial designer: Okay , so uh next presentation {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Participant four . So Harry . marketing: Okay , after having the inputs from {vocalsound} industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here . industrial designer: Mm . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that {disfmarker} These are the findings which we got and {disfmarker} yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote but the technology {disfmarker} We already know that {disfmarker} as discussed earlier {disfmarker} industrial designer: Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: An {vocalsound} it does {gap} how feasible it is . user interface: I- {vocalsound} mm . But I think if you {gap} to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem . I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited {disfmarker} you have limited vocabulary {disfmarker} marketing: Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: We just have the {disfmarker} user interface: Mm . industrial designer: And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: so it's a good idea . marketing: {gap} it's not going to take much space also . It's going to be very slim . user interface: Mm . Mm . marketing: And next one was the size of the remote control . It has to be of course a very slim and small one . And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Mm . marketing: so this is an important criteria here is {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility {gap} . user interface: {vocalsound} Mm . marketing: I mean we have to look for a trade-off . user interface: Yeah . marketing: The features and the cost . user interface: {vocalsound} I no {disfmarker} I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , marketing: Little bit more if it's with extra features . project manager: It {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: yeah , extra features . industrial designer: Yeah , s s speech is a important extra feature I think {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . user interface: Mm . {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: Yeah , yeah . That's right . project manager: But is it useful or not u I don't know . industrial designer: Well , uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: There is {gap} in the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: I mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Or they say movie name {disfmarker} or I don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . user interface: Mm . project manager: Mm . user interface: Mm . marketing: So , I think this should be a good idea , to put this features . And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages . industrial designer: we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well {disfmarker} yes a microphone into the the remote control , so {disfmarker} marketing: Mm , I think {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} project manager: I think i {vocalsound} industrial designer: it will be alright . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} If it's necessary can {disfmarker} you can do that . user interface: What is the teletext ? Mm . project manager: We can integrate small microphone in the remote industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: so it's not really a problem . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: What about lighting adaptive options ? marketing: Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but {vocalsound} I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . project manager: According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that . Yeah . user interface: It is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller . project manager: Mm . user interface: So you need s special T_V_ sets to do that ? Or it's it's done via this remote controller ? It's very complex . marketing: I mean {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , I think it's a bit complex too {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: I mean {disfmarker} yeah , it's for the um industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: For our next product , our new T_V_ set with uh automatical uh sound adjustment {vocalsound} light {gap} {disfmarker} marketing: I think {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , then we can conclude that . Yeah . Yeah , but it's quite possible but maybe not in this project . project manager: So we have {disfmarker} I think we have s still we have couple of minutes . Mm-mm . {vocalsound} So any things to to discuss ? Or any suggestions ? user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: The speech interface and uh less uh reasonable uh cost . project manager: Expensive . Price . user interface: Mm . marketing: And the lighting adaptation user interface: Mm . marketing: and the teletext . And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: If you are watching an foreign movie , you get {gap} subtitles sometimes . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: {gap} . marketing: And if I am a German then I would like to have the {disfmarker} my options in German . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: So , the remote {disfmarker} it should have some {disfmarker} it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . industrial designer: Function . marketing: That should be a good uh point . industrial designer: Yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ? I I I think we should give up with teletext , no ? project manager: I think we we can we {disfmarker} {gap} is the {gap} . industrial designer: Yes . Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh {vocalsound} about a way to to access the internet via the television . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Because if {disfmarker} user interface: Using the T_V_ to access the internet ? Or what ? I didn't quite understand {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , okay . industrial designer: So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a {disfmarker} w which will c which will come in a few years . marketing: We already have some {gap} . industrial designer: So if we already have it in our remote control {disfmarker} project manager: So you have to anticipate the the future ? industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} The future demand , market demand . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , to desi marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's right . industrial designer: well , not not to implement it , but to {disfmarker} well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a {disfmarker} yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible . {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} . user interface: The functionality in the future . project manager: In future . user interface: Alright . Yeah . Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital , right . All the programmes , everything will be in digital than analog . Th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah . marketing: Yeah , {gap} . industrial designer: Okay . So {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . So let's go for the the lunch break , and we will meet after . industrial designer: Okay , thank you . user interface: Okay . Thank you . marketing: Okay , thank you .
