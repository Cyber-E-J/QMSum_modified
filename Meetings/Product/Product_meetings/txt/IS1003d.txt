project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {gap} marketing: {gap} industrial designer: Mm-hmm So , ready ? {gap} user interface: 'Kay marketing: No not really Just {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Crap . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Sorry , {vocalsound} I I um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . user interface: It's perfect . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Your judgement it's {disfmarker} is biased . {vocalsound} industrial designer: I'm afraid {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: 'Kay , so whe where is the remote control ? project manager: {vocalsound} So , we are {vocalsound} user interface: Where ? {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: It's here . {vocalsound} project manager: So {vocalsound} let's go for our detailed design meeting . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Yep . project manager: So I will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan , user interface: Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} and our Industrial Designer , Baba . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} So we'll have to evaluate the uh {disfmarker} your proposed remote control , user interface: 'Kay . project manager: and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} And in case if we're {disfmarker} we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the um production . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} So maybe I will let the {disfmarker} our two designers talk about so their {disfmarker} user interface: I have slides . project manager: You have s oh , sorry . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Oops . user interface: Ah , industrial designer: Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything . user interface: Product prod marketing: What slides ? user interface: Yep . Okay . Okay . {vocalsound} So , this is our product or prototype . This is made by clay . project manager: Looks strange . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red . Yellow is uh our company colour , project manager: Okay . user interface: uh red it's uh is more attractive . So we used two basic colour , yellow and red . And the shape , there's two basic shape . The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: It's {disfmarker} we call it a mushroom design . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Uh {disfmarker} user interface: So this is a introduction of our product . project manager: {vocalsound} Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but user interface: Next a mo marketing: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} Okay , project manager: {vocalsound} {disfmarker} keep on speaking . user interface: yeah , so next slide . So there are several key features of our pr prototype . The first is that it is fuzzy . I'm sure this would be the unique design the market . project manager: {vocalsound} Oh . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah I'm sure {vocalsound} . {vocalsound} project manager: Maybe , I hope so . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design . industrial designer: Yeah , that's true . user interface: Um , and uh the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection . In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel . project manager: Chan user interface: So it's quite convenient for user to use it . project manager: Yeah , okay , but don't touch {disfmarker} don't destroy your prototype . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , s {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: okay . Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base . Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable , so uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it . So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button . You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Everything's mushroom . So we can call our remote control the mushroom . industrial designer: Yeah {gap} . user interface: Yeah , everything's mushroom . Mush Mushroom design , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh {vocalsound} like lemon shape , you know , centre {vocalsound} is yellow and t d user interface: Yeah project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah , th that's why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it . {vocalsound} industrial designer: To integrate , you know {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I don't think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I hope nobody will eat it {gap} You know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} in project manager: Oh . user interface: Yeah marketing: Yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends . I mean there was fruits {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Fruits and vegetables . industrial designer: Really ? But {disfmarker} Fruit and vegetable , project manager: Vegetables . Mushroom is a vegetable . industrial designer: so mushroom was a kind of you know {gap} uh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: I don't think it is . project manager: It's vegetable . industrial designer: Mushroom ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Oh , uh I'm not sure . {vocalsound} project manager: So th it's something eatable . industrial designer: We can {disfmarker} it's a veg a kind of vegetable , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: but you know we we integrated them with different colour . user interface: Yeah . marketing: But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it's fine . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable {gap} you know . This , you know , very enlighted colours , you know . marketing: No , I mean , yeah {vocalsound} yeah . Inspira inspiration is {disfmarker} industrial designer: And inspired colour project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: and {vocalsound} and very sophisticated material , so . marketing: True . industrial designer: And so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Next slide . user interface: Uh , no this our only two slides . {vocalsound} project manager: {gap} industrial designer: So what we w what I can add is that , you know {vocalsound} he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , you know , the chip , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: it is a low level chip , and {disfmarker} user interface: So we cut it to see . {vocalsound} industrial designer: You know , we don't need to k {vocalsound} . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: You know wi {vocalsound} the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i user interface: Okay . So where's the battery battery ? industrial designer: The battery it is under {gap} . project manager: In the base . industrial designer: It is in th in {disfmarker} in the base , yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: In the basement . In the basement . user interface: Base . Here ? project manager: And where is the solar solar cell ? user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: But we say uh we sa we said solar . project manager: Where is the solar cell ? industrial designer: In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and {disfmarker} project manager: Oh . Do you think it won't be {disfmarker} It won't cris increase the price ? user interface: Okay marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} I don't think so , project manager: Okay , we'll see after . industrial designer: {vocalsound} but it it's might be okay , so . project manager: We will have first to {disfmarker} industrial designer: I it might be okay . So {disfmarker} project manager: so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: I mean , we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about {disfmarker} uh project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: we had three keys {disfmarker} {vocalsound} key points to uh for this remote control design , user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: and first one was uh project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: fancy look and feel . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale , one being uh no , I think . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh just let me check . industrial designer: So , four point {disfmarker} three point five , it means it's acceptable . marketing: One one being true , and seven being false . Okay . industrial designer: Oops . marketing: Ouch . So user interface: Okay . marketing: Do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ? user interface: Yeah , I think so . industrial designer: I think you have nice colours . {vocalsound} I don't {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: But is it {disfmarker} industrial designer: The sha the bowl shape people like . user interface: Yeah , the shape is unique , and the colour {disfmarker} marketing: Uh I'll agree it's unique , but is it really {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Is it really fancy ? user interface: {vocalsound} So it depend on how d do you define fancy . marketing: Yeah I mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: But it's {disfmarker} you have the lemon aspect of this th this {vocalsound} this thing . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Maybe if you change {disfmarker} if you take the buttons out , and maybe do things like that {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Do Don't do that , please . marketing: I dunno where the lemon is , but industrial designer: {vocalsound} I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like , so {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: I mean it's not obvious . project manager: It would be bet more like a lemon ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: If {disfmarker} industrial designer: Because i marketing: I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Less button . user interface: Uh so , my mush {disfmarker} . industrial designer: {gap} project manager: Looks like more fruit . Maybe a pineapple ? industrial designer: Yeah , but you don't have any button now . user interface: Mm . marketing: Yeah . I dunno . project manager: And you know , you have the finger here , with the buttons ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: That's uh yeah , is that {disfmarker} user interface: Hmm . industrial designer: that's a good idea . marketing: Yeah , it's getting {disfmarker} project manager: It looks {vocalsound} more like a pineapple . industrial designer: So that's great . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Sorry . industrial designer: That's great . {vocalsound} project manager: What's the use for that ? industrial designer: I have no idea , so . {vocalsound} user interface: Uh , for turn turn the ball . If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I have no idea {vocalsound} what {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And where is the voice recognition ? marketing: Okay . user interface: Uh . Ah , it's embedded , your microphone . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . user interface: Th this th th there's two two functions . marketing: Yeah , that's {disfmarker} Wait th that's the second point . user interface: This is microphone array {disfmarker} marketing: First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel . industrial designer: If it is fancy or not . project manager: Okay . Is it better like that ? marketing: I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Looks {disfmarker} okay , industrial designer: So we can we can say t user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: let's say it's a pineapple now . {vocalsound} industrial designer: The colour , is the colour acceptable ? marketing: {vocalsound} No , the colour is okay , that's fine . industrial designer: So the shape now . marketing: I mean it's {disfmarker} project manager: It looks like a {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: but I would say there is more {disfmarker} too much red . project manager: now you took it . industrial designer: It's too much red ? marketing: Um if industrial designer: In the basement ? project manager: It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top . user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} Right . So , from one to seven ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} I will give {disfmarker} I will {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} Mm uh {disfmarker} Seven is the ma the maximum ? industrial designer: I'll gi marketing: No , seven is false and one is true . industrial designer: I'll give two or three . project manager: Three , I will say three . industrial designer: Three , it's okay . Three , three . Three is fine for me . marketing: Three ? user interface: 'Kay marketing: Okay . project manager: Isn't it bitter like that {gap} ? marketing: Three . user interface: Yeah yeah yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Then {vocalsound} uh let me {disfmarker} industrial designer: What other {disfmarker} marketing: The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative . industrial designer: Is it easy to use ? {vocalsound} project manager: Feasible ? {vocalsound} You said previously that you {disfmarker} there's um microphone inside an industrial designer: Ye uh {disfmarker} Embedded . user interface: Yeah , this is microphone array , in fact . industrial designer: It's a micro array , okay . user interface: There four microphone . project manager: Oh . Okay , user interface: So they they they they {disfmarker} there's a microphone array . project manager: and you have the {disfmarker} there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ? user interface: Yeah , yeah . project manager: And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ? user interface: So you can capture voice {disfmarker} yeah , you c industrial designer: Oh yeah , yeah . user interface: Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions . Yeah . industrial designer: And I think you {disfmarker} you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is {disfmarker} I marketing: Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single . industrial designer: {vocalsound} W Yeah , but {disfmarker} project manager: We have tactile buttons . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: I see , you have microphone array embedded . You have {disfmarker} marketing: No , that's good . Yeah . industrial designer: That's good . project manager: Oh , yeah . marketing: Yeah , th that's another really good point . Maybe {disfmarker} okay . industrial designer: I think technically it's acceptable , so {disfmarker} project manager: Maybe two ? industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So using the same scale , two ? project manager: Two ? I would say two industrial designer: Two , yeah , two . It's it's fine , so . project manager: . You agree ? user interface: Yeah , I agree . marketing: Okay . project manager: It's better like that , isn't it ? user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: Now maybe the most critical one . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Most {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use ? industrial designer: Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . But it's just speaking . user interface: Yeah , it's very easy . industrial designer: You just need the command . user interface: You can use this in this way . marketing: Yeah but this this turning {disfmarker} can you can you just re explain me the {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: As a principle . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} Please . user interface: Th this is the base . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: So you can turn to change the channel . marketing: Yeah . Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ? user interface: You just tu turn d d industrial designer: I think maybe if you he project manager: Oh , ok I understand . marketing: Like if you want to go from {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: You take take {vocalsound} the remote , so {disfmarker} industrial designer: If you hear some click {disfmarker} project manager: and you can turn like that to change the channel ? {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: Yeah but imagine you y project manager: I think it's quite easy to so s zapping , but maybe it will be too fast . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to {disfmarker} if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ? industrial designer: Oh yeah , that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult . user interface: Yeah . marketing: How can you go directly to twenty , for example ? {vocalsound} user interface: No , no , no . I {disfmarker} if y uh if {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: it depend on the the angle you turn the {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . I agree . I agree . industrial designer: Yeah but y how {disfmarker} you need to know {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} marketing: But I mean if you're fro from two ? user interface: I if if this is a channel one . So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five . industrial designer: I think something that {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: Yeah , you have a {vocalsound} , like that , and so on . user interface: So change . Yeah . industrial designer: And you you can {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh {disfmarker} project manager: Oh yeah . user interface: Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the {disfmarker} by three hundred thirteen degree . marketing: We're not talking {disfmarker} Yeah . user interface: So you got how many degree you you {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go {disfmarker} industrial designer: I think you can if you have a scale , so {disfmarker} user interface: No no , you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop , the the turn , project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: then the angle you stop is the angle you {disfmarker} is the channel you {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ? user interface: It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the {disfmarker} marketing: So you you count {gap} one degree , two degrees , no . user interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah . You can do it . marketing: I don't think so . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , it's a bit difficult . user interface: I think so {vocalsound} I think so you can do it . {vocalsound} I think so , you can just change . industrial designer: I think b but the the vocal command is easy too . You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah voc vocal command is okay . But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main {disfmarker} user interface: There's uh also a number , you know . project manager: Yeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , so you're passing through all the channels . So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's {disfmarker} you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel . industrial designer: Uh , yeah , and y that's {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it . marketing: And this would be more for browsing , ah . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ? industrial designer: Yeah . To see uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: yeah {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Seems to be good . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Good choice , mister David Jordan . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , I mean you're famous . You {gap} . industrial designer: And but I'd {disfmarker} user interface: And also you can , if you i project manager: {gap} yeah , what's what's this cherry ? user interface: You ca you can turn this . Or you ca you can you can also turn this . industrial designer: It is a turn off t turn off button , maybe . user interface: For this you can tune it's for tune . You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you you skip this . If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} user interface: It's like fine , from coarse to fine . marketing: Mm . user interface: This is coarse , this is fine . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah yeah . That's project manager: Okay . user interface: So it's coarse to fine design . industrial designer: that's very technologic , so . {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Okay the uh th this looks better . Yeah . user interface: Yeah is is {disfmarker} this is , from one channel to maybe to ten channel . industrial designer: S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates user interface: This is from one channel to {disfmarker} industrial designer: maybe one of the {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: Yeah , th you have the vocal commands . industrial designer: Uh it's k {gap} user interface: Yeah . project manager: On off . industrial designer: on off , yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , but it has to be on to recognise fas industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Most of the time you have the {disfmarker} yeah it's a sleeping remote control . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , sleeping . marketing: Ah , that's not the ecological part , yeah . project manager: That's true . W that why we have the solar ti yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} To compensate {gap} . marketing: Solar . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: Okay . project manager: So marketing: So , which number ? project manager: {disfmarker} three . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Easy to use , it's very relative but three it's fine , I think , it's reasonable three . {vocalsound} project manager: Do you agree ? user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: Three ? user interface: Yeah , agree , agree . marketing: So reasonably , is four , is one ? industrial designer: Three f three for me , it's o it's okay . marketing: So , three . user interface: {gap} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Four or three . Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and {disfmarker} no and just take the mean . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: And what's your opinion ? industrial designer: Will you give four ? marketing: Uh we wouldn't say , I mean , those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me . industrial designer: Five ? Yeah , so maybe if {disfmarker} user interface: Uh w w what do y what uh {disfmarker} you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: I think it's easier than traditional controller . If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , you have {disfmarker} you just turn the turn the ball . industrial designer: Yeah but y you know {gap} {disfmarker} user interface: There's two kind of balls , marketing: So you have {disfmarker} user interface: the smaller the the the {disfmarker} so you can c you can c you can control the scale . marketing: {vocalsound} yeah . user interface: But in the traditional controller , how do {disfmarker} how can you control the scale ? marketing: Uh by pushing zero after after the first one . industrial designer: You just push two button , zero and and one . user interface: Yeah , industrial designer: And that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Are there some buttons ? Okay . user interface: Yeah , this function is just for your browsing , from one channel to th the next one , the next s sn s , the th the third one . project manager: It's not what you said previously . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Previously you said that turning this was the fine {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , if you're changing your mind . industrial designer: {gap} marketing: Fine to coarse . project manager: Fine to coarse . user interface: Yeah , yeah . project manager: And from ten to ten channels here . user interface: Y one to ten , ten to twelve , uh ten to t uh twenty . Ten to twenty and this one , t one two three four five six , like this . project manager: Okay . user interface: Uh there's different scale , so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc marketing: Okay . But this this has to stay on the table , right ? user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: This has to stay on the table . industrial designer: {vocalsound} In fact on a flat place {disfmarker} user interface: I i this is just a base . You can just {disfmarker} industrial designer: You can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it {disfmarker} project manager: Oh {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , no no , no . You can't put it out . industrial designer: Oh ye yes , that's right . marketing: Just {disfmarker} It's {disfmarker} project manager: It's just your turning from the base . You need to have everything in hand . If you want to turn , you can't use it and turn . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: It's impossible . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Oh project manager: You need to put it on and turn . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . You know tha that's the weak point , user interface: {vocalsound} You use your y marketing: because with a traditional one you just have one hand . project manager: Yeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control . industrial designer: my God . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} So th this is a d next generation controller . {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Nobody would take it . {vocalsound} marketing: Sure . {vocalsound} Yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah . project manager: So nobody w will lost {disfmarker} lose it . industrial designer: {vocalsound} yeah maybe , maybe may marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: it's the next prototype , maybe we cou user interface: {vocalsound} Okay okay , okay . project manager: S maybe we can change from th industrial designer: Four . Maybe four , it's okay . user interface: Four . Okay . project manager: Four ? Easy to use , four . industrial designer: I'll put four . project manager: Gonna say four . marketing: Four . industrial designer: Yeah , four it's more reasonable . marketing: Uh it's even easier to {disfmarker} maybe . industrial designer: You can you can erase with this er yeah . marketing: Ok user interface: Okay . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Yeah , four it's more reasonable , so . So it's nine , marketing: So , average ? industrial designer: nine over three . user interface: Three ? marketing: Three ? project manager: Trois . Three . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Oh yeah , it's {gap} . user interface: Trois . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: Okay , so {disfmarker} industrial designer: It need maybe some wo further work , but it's {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , especially on the easy to use industrial designer: Yeah , uh s yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: target . industrial designer: Might {disfmarker} it might be fine . project manager: So , th the project is accepted ? marketing: Okay . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , b I think {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} So uh mm mm . Mm . industrial designer: That's the finance . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the evaluation . So as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we'll have look to the final sh financial view . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Mm . Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} So we need to calculate the production cost . As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Mm-hmm . project manager: And if not {disfmarker} if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Oh yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: So , just have a look at the {disfmarker} okay here is the Excel sheet , so industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: so it has the energy source . We have hand dynamo . No , we don't use that . marketing: No . project manager: We have battery , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , we have battery . project manager: Kinetic , we don't have it , I suppose , industrial designer: No , project manager: but we have solar cells . industrial designer: um solar cells , yeah . project manager: Um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ? Do you think one would be enough , or {disfmarker} such as {vocalsound} as number of branches ? industrial designer: Uh I think in each ball you have three {disfmarker} project manager: Three ? industrial designer: three uh yeah , three , yeah . Three {gap} three solar cells . project manager: So , electronic . Single simple chip on print ? Just one would be necessary ? industrial designer: S s simple , simple , yeah . project manager: One ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Zero for the others . And sample sensor , sample speaker . One ? industrial designer: Mm . One maybe , yeah . project manager: As we have voice recognition , I think . industrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah . project manager: So the case . industrial designer: Is it {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: Is sh it {gap} marketing: So we are all already nineteen . industrial designer: Wooden . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: just keep on going , just to have an idea . user interface: The solar cell is too expensive . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Is {disfmarker} Yes a wooden pl I and that's {disfmarker} project manager: Well uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: There's no wood , so plastic just only , I think . project manager: yeah , but what what about case ? Uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved . I think it's more like double curved . marketing: That's gonna be double curved , yeah . industrial designer: Double curve , yeah , double curve . project manager: One ? industrial designer: One , you have . project manager: {vocalsound} Uh wood ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: But it's {disfmarker} yeah , a a rubber uh {disfmarker} marketing: Rather four buttons . project manager: Uh do we need special colour ? marketing: Oh no , interface . project manager: Y maybe , two ? We have two special colours . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . Y y yeah , yeah . marketing: Yeah , yeah that's special colours , sure . project manager: Push button . user interface: Mm . Yeah , we have four . industrial designer: Five ? user interface: {vocalsound} Five . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Scroll wheel . We don no . user interface: No . project manager: It it's more like integrated scor . industrial designer: I think that this will be like a scroll wheel , actually . user interface: No no . marketing: Yeah tha that's wheel . industrial designer: Y you tu you turn you turn it , so {disfmarker} user interface: No no no , it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: Yeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , true . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Okay , yeah , yeah . Scr project manager: So , no button supplements ? marketing: I think the price is okay . user interface: No . project manager: Okay . marketing: Um , no . project manager: Okay we {disfmarker} I think we have problem . {vocalsound} industrial designer: L_C_ display , maybe . Interface . project manager: I think we s if we keep on adding things {disfmarker} industrial designer: It's okay . {vocalsound} {gap} fine {gap} . project manager: so we have to {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells . project manager: Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: Has it changed . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , it was stage one , so . marketing: No y i it did change , but project manager: Okay . user interface: We have change the electronics to {disfmarker} from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . Oh . marketing: just imagine we have {disfmarker} industrial designer: So {disfmarker} user interface: We have to delete the the sample sensor , I think . project manager: Yeah , but we have {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} the the voice recognition , marketing: Yeah . project manager: no ? marketing: Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah it's the one it's {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . user interface: m maybe we ha we have two versions , the first version , the basic version . industrial designer: I think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe . user interface: Advanced version we have speak . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Because uh it seems that this can be {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , if {disfmarker} project manager: Or it would be better . industrial designer: yeah , wood into plastic and it it should be fine . user interface: Plastic is free . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} So , do we need special colour ? marketing: Yeah , that's one of the requirement . project manager: Because we have red . industrial designer: Yeah , red and yellow . project manager: Red and yellow . user interface: Wait . industrial designer: Fancy . user interface: We we can we can we c {vocalsound} marketing: We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black . user interface: yellow . marketing: Black then is a regular colour , so . project manager: I think so we need {disfmarker} if we try to have a kind of industrial designer: {gap} marketing: Yeah , one . project manager: pineapple bee . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . So push button then it's it's the next expensive one . project manager: Yeah . An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . And I think this is one . Integrated scroll wheel push button marketing: Yeah , thi this might be . project manager: . So we'll {disfmarker} we have only one ? And push button . marketing: Close to . project manager: So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button , it's uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: One . I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons , so we can just , I dunno , try to modify some of them to have {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: Okay , so what's the bottleneck ? user interface: How about we change the sale ? marketing: Double curved . industrial designer: Double curve . We can transform the double curve into single c yeah . project manager: Something flat . industrial designer: F some {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , but flat {disfmarker} project manager: S uncurved . Yeah , maybe not . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Single curve {gap} . marketing: Case , what's the ca project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Single curve should be fine , so . Oh , what {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Mm . Nearly . user interface: Ah we have one {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: And then one Euro left . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Um . project manager: {vocalsound} Maybe don't bat no battery , only solar cells . industrial designer: {vocalsound} It's it's a bad idea , so . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} I think there's a problem with the push push button . We only need maybe just one . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Two ? project manager: Just one . industrial designer: One . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: That's fine . That's fine . {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . Okay . {vocalsound} Agree . project manager: So {vocalsound} yeah , you will have {disfmarker} marketing: So we have one button , industrial designer: {gap} One s one scroll wheel , so marketing: one wheel . project manager: So one button , and s scroll wheel with push button on it . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {disfmarker} {vocalsound} And the vocal chord , it's fine . {gap} It I th it's fine . project manager: So {disfmarker} marketing: It's good they're not charging anything for that . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: So , yeah . It think we we've done good job , as the cost is user interface: Cou could we have look {disfmarker} project manager: twelve fifty e user interface: Could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost ? marketing: Yeah y actually it's wrong . We're not under twelve Euros and a half . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , but it's under or equal . It's not written . Sometimes it's under or equal . industrial designer: It's fine . It's under or equal . It's fine , so {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . So let's say {disfmarker} project manager: Twelve fifty . user interface: Wha what {disfmarker} industrial designer: It's fine , twelve fifty uh {disfmarker} user interface: yeah . Which part is the most expensive part ? {vocalsound} marketing: Solar cells . project manager: Yeah , I think . industrial designer: The solar cells , r is i is it ? user interface: Yeah , I think it's not t t project manager: I think , yeah . But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , to be able to si to sell it . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Cheaper . marketing: That's nice argument , industrial designer: Yeah , with mi marketing: but if it's it's still four our of twelve . industrial designer: It's {disfmarker} it is really really uh really very very expensive , though . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Maybe if uh {disfmarker} okay . project manager: Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so . {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . marketing: Yeah but we just have one button . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: So it's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button . marketing: Easy . I don't know about powerful . Yeah . project manager: Easy , powerful . industrial designer: It's easy to use . It's very easy to use . {gap} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Mm . project manager: So I don't think we need to redesign the p the product . industrial designer: No . marketing: Uh that's what we've just done . industrial designer: We've done it with {disfmarker} it is under the {disfmarker} if it was low , high or so . project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So {disfmarker} marketing: Um okay . project manager: Now {disfmarker} industrial designer: So {disfmarker} So what are we going to do with this project evaluation ? project manager: So {disfmarker} marketing: Well I think we have just have to discuss if {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay , okay , it's fine . marketing: I dunno . project manager: So did you enjoy your clay modelling ? user interface: Yes . Of course . This is my job . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah ? {vocalsound} Was it a nice way to create your remote control ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , it's uh it's good , to to create a control instead of a computer . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah , I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to {disfmarker} from the beginning to the end . And designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and uh and it was very {vocalsound} informative for {gap} . user interface: Yeah . project manager: And for the marketing guy ? marketing: Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe . industrial designer: Yep {vocalsound} . marketing: 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff user interface: Okay . marketing: next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it {disfmarker} um . industrial designer: Okay , okay . project manager: And new ideas about new products , maybe , wi which would be fashion and uh and yellow . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yellow . {vocalsound} I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a fruit T_V_ or I dunno . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: It can be an interesting I don't know {disfmarker} project manager: Yes , just lemon . industrial designer: Yeah , just a lemon T_V_ it'd be {vocalsound} yellow lemon . user interface: Yeah , but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's um {disfmarker} industrial designer: It's flat , uh {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah yeah it's flat , project manager: Squared ? user interface: yeah the shape is very boring . industrial designer: Yeah , that's right . It's really boring , yeah . user interface: Could we come up with new T_V_ with {disfmarker} such as this kind of T_V_ ? industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: So you can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you have base , triangle base so you the T_V_ you can {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Ah , the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , that's {disfmarker} that would be really interesting , actually . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . Because the T_V_ you {vocalsound} also {disfmarker} project manager: Oh , that's interesting . You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . Electronic device . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} Device devi user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: Yeah , but just don't trust too much the trends . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: The fruit ? {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Maybe {disfmarker} marketing: 'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh . project manager: Yeah , maybe la next year it will be insects . industrial designer: Yeah , it's {disfmarker} marketing: Maybe two years it's dead . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Mm . marketing: Yeah , but this is good because it's not a long long life product . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: T_V_ is more like fifteen years , maybe , so . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . That's a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah . marketing: If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for industrial designer: We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know . marketing: fifteen years {disfmarker} project manager: Customable T_V_ . industrial designer: Yeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah , yeah . project manager: Ah such {disfmarker} yeah . You've already said mobile phones . user interface: Okay . marketing: Tha that would that would make it . Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , you can keep the global appearan project manager: Yeah , and following {disfmarker} industrial designer: The mood of persons , the fashions uh {disfmarker} project manager: Mm . user interface: Yeah . project manager: It's interesting , maybe we can create a a line of uh T_V_ with uh a a tr industrial designer: We int {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , T_V_ , yeah . A T_V_ for autumn and a T_V_ for winter , you know , so it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So what i and do w is it {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Okay . project manager: So I think the costs are within the budget . We're just at twelve fifty Euros . industrial designer: Yeah , the pr {gap} at {disfmarker} user interface: Yep . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: do you think you can celebrate your creation ? user interface: And you can celebrate your leadership . {vocalsound} project manager: Oh , thanks a lot . {vocalsound} Thank you , mister David Jordan . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah but I think f {vocalsound} it's really a celebrating object . {vocalsound} So it's yellow and very {disfmarker} a very ha it's very happy , so . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: Hmm . industrial designer: Uh it's it's a pr it's like {disfmarker} yeah . marketing: Yeah . It's party party remote control . project manager: The thing now is to to sell it . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah , it's your job . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Sell it . {vocalsound} industrial designer: right , go and sell it . Goo and good luck , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . Okay and the twelve fifty {disfmarker} twelve uh twelve {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Uh-huh . Twenty five Euros . user interface: Twenty five Euros , yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} It should be fine . marketing: Yeah , I think it's {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: It's maybe a little bit expensive . {vocalsound} user interface: Twenty five Euros . marketing: It's cheap , yeah . {vocalsound} No , I {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} No , it's not so expensive . marketing: I'm not so happy about the fruit shape , you know . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Wh really ? project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: It should be it should be fine , you know , actually . {vocalsound} S user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . project manager: Maybe what you can do a test . Put it outside , and if bees come , {vocalsound} it's really fruit . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I I think I like {vocalsound} the the colour a the colour are very good , so actually so {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} But don't put sugar in it , it's not working . user interface: Okay . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} No , the colours are uh {disfmarker} it's perfect , yeah . industrial designer: It's perfect , and {disfmarker} marketing: True . Uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still . industrial designer: I p is th y {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , but the colour , I think the colour is more {disfmarker} is most important , industrial designer: the the yellow ball thing that {disfmarker} marketing: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control . marketing: Still that was one of the requirements we had . It's {disfmarker} yeah but it {disfmarker} I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere . industrial designer: Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_ {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Okay yeah , yeah . That's actually good idea , so {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: Mm . project manager: So we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , user interface: So we have to give a {disfmarker} project manager: so we have the slogan too . user interface: So we have give him {disfmarker} give it a cute name . project manager: Yeah industrial designer: {gap} project manager: th no , it's the it's the pineapple control {disfmarker} remote control . user interface: Mush mushroom controller . marketing: Cute na You cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend . project manager: It's a pineapple now , it has changed . It's a pineapple . industrial designer: It's not a mushroom . {vocalsound} It's a pineapple remote controls . marketing: It's not the trend . project manager: Pineapple . user interface: Pa Pine apple . industrial designer: Yeah , pineapple remote remote control . marketing: Yeah , but just flying saucer , or {disfmarker} project manager: With cherry on top . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Oh , that {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: I would say flying saucer . industrial designer: Oh unid uh unidentified remote control , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: It's more appropriate , somehow . user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: That's that's pineapple remote control . I think it's fine . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Will you buy one ? industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah I will try {vocalsound} I'll try {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . marketing: Mm . project manager: {vocalsound} Try to . Okay uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Twenty five {vocalsound} Euro . industrial designer: {gap} . I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . Yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your T_V_ industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah I always lose my {disfmarker} Yeah , so so i if it is a universal one I can use it with my T_V_ , so it would be {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} so you need to buy one . project manager: {vocalsound} One thing I like is the shape , because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket , on uh in your jacket . user interface: Okay . {vocalsound} marketing: Mm . industrial designer: {gap} user interface: Traditional one ? Yeah . So this one and this one . What do you choose ? project manager: I prefer the laser remote control . {vocalsound} No . industrial designer: {vocalsound} I think I would choose this one because of the colour . It's marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} What do you choose ? Okay . industrial designer: it's will enlight your house , your home and your T_V_ , so . user interface: Okay . project manager: Oh . Maybe next if we decide to do something we'd {disfmarker} can put light inside . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah , yeah that would be uh an idea . marketing: Yeah but that's going to be expensive , you know . project manager: Yeah . marketing: We had some problems {vocalsound} going to twelve Euros and uh I dunno . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: I think it it would be interesting to {disfmarker} just to see if we can {disfmarker} if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah . marketing: Yeah , afterwards , if user interface: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: if it's a new trend . Okay . project manager: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah that's that fine . So we can celebrate now . That's our new product . project manager: Champagne {gap} , mister Baba . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yes . marketing: We should celebrate . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} It's it's fine . It's {disfmarker} I like it {vocalsound} . {vocalsound} Next time . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: So buy one . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Well , I'll buy one here . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: So {disfmarker} marketing: Mm . project manager: Okay , I will close this . Mm . industrial designer: Yeah . No ? project manager: {vocalsound} So I think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control industrial designer: Okay . Okay . marketing: Yeah . project manager: and we have a nearly final product . marketing: Our final prototype which {disfmarker} yeah . industrial designer: Final prototype , yeah , ye yeah . project manager: Final prototype , right . user interface: Prototype , yeah . project manager: So , thank you very much . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Okay . {vocalsound} Okay . user interface: Okay . project manager: Very productive . user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . Thanks . industrial designer: S so who is going to take the remote control ?
