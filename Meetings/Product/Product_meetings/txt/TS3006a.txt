user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Mm uh . marketing: {vocalsound} {gap} We're the first . user interface: Mm . We're the first ones . {vocalsound} marketing: Marketing Expert , yes . project manager: Mm . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: So you found your spots . marketing: Yes . user interface: {vocalsound} Move to the meeting room . {vocalsound} marketing: Bling bling . {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: Okay . marketing: Right . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . marketing: Uh {vocalsound} where has my screen gone ? industrial designer: Hi . user interface: Hello , good day . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Oh yeah , we have to talk in English , marketing: Hmm . industrial designer: huh . user interface: Yep . marketing: Yeah . My screen is gone . project manager: It's called black . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Oh . user interface: Kick-off meeting , wow . It's uh looks uh nice . industrial designer: I'm afraid I'm a bit slow for this stuff uh . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . user interface: Hmm ? marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: I'm afraid I'm a bit too slow . {vocalsound} I don't know how much preparation you guys did , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: but not a lot . marketing: Yeah . user interface: No , it's {disfmarker} it was uh not enough . project manager: You see this beautiful presentation . marketing: Yeah . Very nice . project manager: Okay let's get started . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Uh I sort of prepared this . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh opening acquaintance , tool training , uh how to use the things here . Uh project plan discussion , and yeah then the rest of the meeting . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Um we're supposed to develop a new remote control , that's both original , trendy and user-friendly . So , marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: hope you have good ideas . I don't . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} I did my best . project manager: Um we're work we're working uh from top to bottom . Uh functional design , industrial designer: Not yet . project manager: then we do some in individual work , then we have a meeting to discuss the results , etcetera etcetera . And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up . Uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard . Um uh we should take some practice . I have some instructions now to do that . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Uh well you know how to {disfmarker} the documents work . So {disfmarker} Uh this for toolbar . You see it next . Um we have a pen . And we can use this pen to perform . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Yes . industrial designer: Operations . project manager: So {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: It doesn't always work . Yes . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay so you can draw . marketing: Draw . Alright . project manager: Okay and in the format menu you can select colour and line width , etcetera etcetera . Okay ? marketing: 'Kay . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} Okay . Each of you can uh take some practice and you should draw an animal . Uh you should explain {disfmarker} Uh with different colours and with different pen widths . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: And you should explain why you draw that particular animal . user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} Don't take up too much space . {vocalsound} project manager: So , Julian . user interface: Um yeah . industrial designer: Different pen widths , how do you do that ? user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Uh with the format menu . industrial designer: Oh okay . project manager: And use different colours etcetera . user interface: {vocalsound} It's a giraffe . Yeah . project manager: And {vocalsound} what's that supposed to be ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: Are you serious ? marketing: {vocalsound} Should it be one {disfmarker} project manager: Oh yeah . {vocalsound} Oh yeah user interface: {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: four legs . Uh-huh . {vocalsound} marketing: Giraffe's yellow . {vocalsound} user interface: Uh it needs some uh some yellow uh {disfmarker} Oh format . marketing: Can you use one blank sheet per drawing ? Or project manager: Yeah . marketing: so y you must save it at the end project manager: Yeah marketing: and then {disfmarker} project manager: you can press the next button , which is uh {disfmarker} yeah . I'll show you . user interface: That's some spots . industrial designer: I in the file option menu . project manager: Yeah . In file menu . marketing: Okay , user interface: No . marketing: then m make a new one . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: How much time do we have to draw anyway ? {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: 'Cause I can take forever on this . project manager: {gap} user interface: Okay . Do I have to explain uh why I chose this uh this animal ? project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} user interface: I think it's a it's a great animal . project manager: What is it ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} It's a it's a giraffe . project manager: A giraffe okay . Yeah I see a long neck user interface: Yeah , that's a {disfmarker} project manager: but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: It's more like a dinosaur . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Okay I'll will give it an uh an eye . project manager: Okay . That's nice of you . marketing: {vocalsound} Uh . user interface: Hey . Come on . marketing: Some leaf to eat . {vocalsound} user interface: {gap} {vocalsound} project manager: Okay .

It misses the spot . project manager: {gap} pressure . industrial designer: I'm guessing a turtle . No . {vocalsound} I'm kidding . marketing: {vocalsound} I say good guess . Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Why a turtle ? industrial designer: Because of its shell . marketing: Because it's slow . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} It's slow . user interface: 'Cause it's so project manager: You were slow too user interface: 'cause it's green . {vocalsound} project manager: so {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah I was a bit slow too . industrial designer: Dude you're a good drawer . marketing: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh some other line uh width uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Do you have a turtle pet ? project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} No . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Uh okay . marketing: I dunno . {vocalsound} Does it have legs ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah . project manager: Yeah sure . marketing: Yeah ? project manager: Yeah not exactly legs but {disfmarker} More like fins marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Stumpy stuff . project manager: or {disfmarker} marketing: It's more like a tank .

Let's see . project manager: Orange . industrial designer: How am I gonna do this ? Um {disfmarker} Mm uh . user interface: A rabbit I think . project manager: Kangaroo . user interface: Kangaroo . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Not quite actually . user interface: Fox . marketing: A fox yeah . project manager: Dog . marketing: Firefox . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: No . project manager: Cat . industrial designer: Aye . {vocalsound} It's a cat . project manager: It's a cat . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Not quite yet through . marketing: A cat who had an accident or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Why a cat ? industrial designer: Uh yeah I dunno . They're my favourite pets . project manager: You have some uh ? industrial designer: Uh I have colour already . Yeah I'm not so good at drawing with this kind of project manager: {vocalsound} The pen , industrial designer: st Oh shit . Um {disfmarker} project manager: yeah . industrial designer: Excuse my language . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Sure . {vocalsound} industrial designer: I don't know how to draw its face . But you get the idea . project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} Alright . industrial designer: It's a cat . It's my favourite uh pet animal , 'cause they're cute , they're independent and cuddly , I dunno . {vocalsound} project manager: Okay . industrial designer: That's it . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Or do I need to use more colours and {disfmarker} project manager: {gap} I think it's okay . You get idea industrial designer: Alright . project manager: right ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Okay um industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: we have a financial aspect to this project . {vocalsound} Um we can sell them at twenty five Euros . Uh the aim is to reach {disfmarker} uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros . Uh that's quite a big amount of money . And the production cost should be the half of the selling price . Okay industrial designer: So we have to s project manager: now it's time for some discussion . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} user interface: Okay . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} user interface: What uh what uh do you want to discuss ? {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: We should get started . user interface: Yep . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Uh I'm taking notes . Um marketing: Okay . Great . project manager: we each have a specific task , as I saw in my mail . I didn't know if you received the same mail . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah ? industrial designer: I guess so . Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay so the um {vocalsound} uh {gap} this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design . Am I correct ? industrial designer: True . project manager: Okay . Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions . Right ? Yeah ? user interface: Yep . project manager: {vocalsound} And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Uh did any of you already do some work on this part or {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Well I started making an overview for myself , um what I had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever . project manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . industrial designer: So I had to uh , {vocalsound} I dunno , make an overview for myself about what I have to do , project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how I have to fill it . project manager: Mm-hmm . And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ? industrial designer: Well I started I started with the first phase , I think was the functional . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: And uh let's see I had to focus on the working design , which you said . project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: How does the apparatus work ? And well I basically had two points . Uh {vocalsound} according to the coffee uh machine example , I have batteries to supply energy , project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ . project manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: And that's basically all I have so far . project manager: Yeah I got another point . It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo . user interface: Yeah . Wireless uh {disfmarker} huh . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Alright . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So that's very common . user interface: Uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function . You d you already told that . And for the changing up to the {disfmarker} to all the channels and changing the volume . That are the the basic options for a remote control . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah I kept it global 'cause {vocalsound} {disfmarker} that it activates or deactivates specific functions , user interface: Okay , yeah . industrial designer: 'cause I wasn't thinking yet about that . I mean , you wanna ch ch flip the channel user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: but you might wanna use teletext also . user interface: Yep . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: I dunno what the word is in English . Uh {gap} {disfmarker} project manager: Same I believe {gap} . marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: Uh and what did the Marketing Expert do ? marketing: Uh well from a marketing uh {vocalsound} perspective , um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: Um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? So there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research {vocalsound} uh to see what existing products are there out in the market . project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: I mean , what functions do they have . project manager: Mm . marketing: Um especially what are their shortcomings ? Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product ? project manager: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . marketing: Um therefore we have to to do some internet search . For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions ? project manager: Yep . Yes . marketing: So we can see uh what needs to be supported . Um {vocalsound} and we can interview current users and future users . What w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control ? Um especially for future users , project manager: Okay . Okay . marketing: uh I'm thinking of early adopters , because they they use new technology first , project manager: Mm-hmm . marketing: and they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add . project manager: Okay . And you can get that information ? marketing: I think I can get that information , yeah . project manager: Okay . That would be very handy . marketing: So {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: Um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are ? marketing: No n not specifically . project manager: No ? marketing: More to how to get them project manager: No okay . user interface: {vocalsound} I got some uh requirements marketing: and {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah ? user interface: it has uh {gap} it has to be user-friendly . marketing: Yeah ? project manager: {vocalsound} Of course . industrial designer: Yeah . Obviously . marketing: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh really easy to use buttons , not not uh very small buttons , but not the the also the big big buttons , but just normal buttons . It has to be a small unit . It has to be uh {disfmarker} yeah , you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house . So it has n has not to be l yeah , gigantic uh machine . project manager: Big , mm-hmm . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Uh and a and a good uh zapping range . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Uh what do you mean by that ? user interface: Uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be , uh yeah um yeah , quite a big distance . marketing: Yeah . user interface: It has to be capable for zapping uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . From the other end of the room or something ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay um {disfmarker} Well I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment . Um I think the best is to go to work . industrial designer: Whoa . Is that you project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: or {disfmarker} alright . project manager: Okay . marketing: Any more points to discuss ? project manager: Yeah . I think we can go ahead with what we have . I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder . Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera . And it seems you get more information by email . So {vocalsound} marketing: Alright . industrial designer: Alright . project manager: that was it for me . user interface: Okay . marketing: 'Kay . Thanks . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} user interface: Are you going to put the the notes on the {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , in the project folder . Yeah . marketing: Yeah . The pro okay . user interface: Okay . {vocalsound} project manager: I'm writing very fast . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Alright . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . Okay . project manager: Hope it's readable . user interface: Yep . marketing: Uh . project manager: Okay {vocalsound} um anything more you want to add to the discussion ? marketing: I guess so . industrial designer: Well no I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh session ? user interface: Yeah . Do we only have to to do uh phase one , the functional design uh ? project manager: Yeah . Because then we have a {disfmarker} user interface: After that we are going to the conceptual uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Y you do some individual work , marketing: We're just working the three phases . project manager: we have meeting , individual work , meeting . And at the end of the day we have a final meeting . And then I have to prepare {disfmarker} uh I have to defend our design , user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: so make it good . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah okay . We'll do our best . marketing: Okay . project manager: I depend on you . user interface: Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} Better make it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} industrial designer: I am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in . project manager: Yeah ? If you can mix it it's okay . Mm-hmm . Yeah . industrial designer: Do we {disfmarker} I mean , is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ? Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ? {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} That is my question also project manager: Yeah . marketing: because like new new functions {disfmarker} project manager: Well I think that is the user requirements part . marketing: Requirements . Yeah . project manager: As to what they want . Uh do they want all those functions on that small {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah . True . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: But but we need good communication about this stuff , marketing: Unit . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: 'cause I have to f put the components into the design . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: I would first m industrial designer: So if I don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard . marketing: Yeah well project manager: Yeah I understand . marketing: I I was {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . I I think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them . marketing: Yeah project manager: You can always add a few {disfmarker} marketing: well like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which I know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices . project manager: Yeah . marketing: So you can switch to your video project manager: Hmm , marketing: and then the same buttons control your video . project manager: the C_D_ player . Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular . industrial designer: Yeah so {disfmarker} marketing: And then use your Windows media centre {vocalsound} under your T_V_ with the same remote control . So with the switch , one single switch {gap} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Yeah I I know what you mean , but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player . marketing: S project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function . marketing: Yeah project manager: Okay . industrial designer: And you you don't need that for a T_V_ . marketing: records and stuff like that . industrial designer: And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well , marketing: No . project manager: You need additional {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: so I kind of need to know what we uh need . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Whatever , I'll just put my ideas in uh in here project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: and then we can discuss it with the next uh meeting . marketing: In the project uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video . And um reserve the possibility to add other features . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: So we have a basic starting point industrial designer: Okay . project manager: and you can always extend that so make sure it's extendible . Yeah . user interface: Yeah it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly . industrial designer: Alright . marketing: Yeah . user interface: So it's hasn't {gap} {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Th the least amount of functions possible user interface: Yeah . project manager: so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera . user interface: Okay . Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . I understand . Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah ? Okay and uh I'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to . industrial designer: Alright . marketing: Yes . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , you're di dismissed . user interface: Can we leave now marketing: Half an hour . user interface: or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Thanks . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} You're fired . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Not yet . marketing: No . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Alright . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: Alright let's move on . project manager: Let's see what we got to do . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} See you later . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Okay . marketing: Yeah see you later . user interface: Good luck . {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . Thank you . marketing: Well good luck . {vocalsound} industrial designer: What the {disfmarker}
