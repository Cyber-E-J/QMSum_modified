industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Hmm . project manager: Okay . Good morning everybody . Um I'm glad you could all come . I'm really excited to start this team . Um I'm just gonna have a little PowerPoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . My name is Rose Lindgren . I I'll be the Project Manager . Um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit , including a tool training exercise . And then we'll move into the project plan , do a little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes . First of all our project aim . Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about , it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly . I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those . Um so we're gonna divide us up into three {vocalsound} compa three parts . First the functional design which will be uh first we'll do individual work , come into a meeting , the conceptional design , individual work and a meeting , and then the detailed design , individual work and a meeting . So that we'll each be doing our own ideas and then coming together and um collaborating . Okay , we're gonna get to know each other a little bit . So um , what we're gonna do is start off with um let's start off with Amina . Um Alima , industrial designer: Alima . project manager: sorry , Alima . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: Um we're gonna do a little tool training , so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you . Um introduce yourself , um say one thing about yourself and then draw your favourite animal and tell us about it . industrial designer: Okay . Um I don't know which one of these I have to bring with me . project manager: Probably both . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Right , so , I'm supposed to draw my favourite animal . I have no drawing skills whatsoever . But uh let's see , introduce myself . My name is Alima Bucciantini . Um I'm from the state of Maine in the US . I'm doing nationalism studies , blah , blah , blah , and I have no artistic talents . project manager: How do you spell your name ? industrial designer: A_ L_ I_ M_ A_ . project manager: Thanks . industrial designer: Oh , and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project . So let's see if I can get marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: um here . I will draw a little turtle for you all . Not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal , but just that I think they're drawable . And you have the pretty little shell going on . Some little eyes . Happy . There you go . That's a turtle . marketing: Yes . project manager: So what are your favourite characteristics ? industrial designer: Um . I I like the whole having a shell thing . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: It's quite cool carry your home around where you go , um quite decorative little animals , they can swim , they can , they're very adaptable , they carry everything they need with them , um and they're easy to draw . project manager: {vocalsound} Excellent . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Shall we just go around the table ? user interface: Uh Okay . Well , my name is Iain uh project manager: Mm . user interface: and I'm the User Interface Designer for the project . Um . And I'll try and draw my favourite animal . industrial designer: {vocalsound} No , user interface: I'll {disfmarker} I should leave that one on there industrial designer: you can erase the turtle , user interface: shouldn't I {vocalsound} before I callously rub it off . industrial designer: it's alright . project manager: Might be nice to have them all up there at same time . user interface: {vocalsound} Um I'm not gonna draw it quite to scale um . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Is that at least identifiable ? industrial designer: Snake . marketing: Well . project manager: Em industrial designer: Well , user interface: It's a whale {vocalsound} , yes . industrial designer: snake ? {vocalsound} It's w {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Thanks . marketing: Oh my god , it's better than what I'm gonna be able to do . user interface: {vocalsound} Um and , yeah , the reason I like whales is 'cause uh they're {disfmarker} well , first of all they're quite intelligent um and also they're they're kind of mysterious , like we don't really know much about them or or understand how they work , how they form groups . And I just find them interesting animals . marketing: Take my contraptions with me . Alright , I'm Jessy . I'm from around D_C_ ish sort of in the U_S_ . And we're gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on , {gap} animal . Don't really know how to draw this . Just where can I {disfmarker} Mm . Mm . Maybe if I do the water , industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: but how ? Sort of give an idea . {vocalsound} I have no idea how one would explain this . Mm maybe with some whiskers . Briefly , it's supposed to be a seal . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: You can imagine it in the water . I like them , because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time . Not gonna try and pretend like I can get any better than that . {vocalsound} project manager: Mm 'kay . Mm 'kay ? I'm Rose and I'm Project Manager , {vocalsound} from California . Um . Hmm . {vocalsound} S {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Oh , marketing: It's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it . industrial designer: a cat . project manager: Um it's actually a coyote . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Let's see . Let's see , industrial designer: Right . marketing: {vocalsound} That's impressive . project manager: let's give it a little bit of a snout , I don't know , some teeth . industrial designer: That's {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: That's pretty impressive . user interface: Cool . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Oh dear . {vocalsound} Yes . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: I live um I live right across the street from an open space in California . We have coyotes howl all the time . So I really enjoy their their singing , you they're really beautiful animals . Mm . {vocalsound} Okay um , moving on to slightly more serious stuff . We're gonna talk about project finances . Um we have a couple {vocalsound} we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales and because this is such {disfmarker} this is for television it's a {disfmarker} we have a market range of Internet , like it's an international market range , we don't have to worry about specifics . Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro . So we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for . Okay um , just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , I could {disfmarker} I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control , what would be the best um like you {disfmarker} what are the features that you really like what are the features that you don't like , etcetera , so {disfmarker} marketing: Um I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_ like you have to do one for the power of the T_V_ and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going , I don't know . Now they keep combining all different remotes together , and I don't know if I necessarily like that 'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: I just wanna watch the T_V_ {vocalsound} um . project manager: Hmm . marketing: {vocalsound} Always gets lost . Some sort of like device to help you find it . user interface: I've used , I've used remote controls , for things like T_V_ and the C_D_ player and video recorder and I I guess they're they're pretty neat neat little tools uh . You don't have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel . project manager: Mm . user interface: So especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty nice . Um . I find them {disfmarker} they can be a bit annoying , especially , like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have have to have three separate remote controls of {disfmarker} in front of me , you know , one for the T_V_ , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . Um . And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , they've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all I really wanna do is switch on and off , change the channel , change the volume . industrial designer: Yeah um . I agree with having too many remotes around . My dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , and I don't know how to work half of them um . What's important for me , I guess , is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons , they are not too small , you know you know you need to n to know what you're doing . And one thing I particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Um , I think there is a way around that , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: but I know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on , project manager: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . industrial designer: so i it's just simpler just to just turn around the T_V_ itself , and I think that's {disfmarker} if we're gonna make a remote control , it should actually work for what it's doing . So {disfmarker} marketing: What about like batteries and things like that , like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries ? project manager: {vocalsound} Um I would imagine all of them , industrial designer: I know . project manager: but we could {disfmarker} but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery um that would last a lot longer than like double A_s . industrial designer: Yeah , something that doesn't {disfmarker} marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Um like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um M_P_ three players now and that kind of thing . Um . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Mm . project manager: Um . Okay , it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . So um like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote , and yet you don't wanna have five remotes . So how do we work with that ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Could we get something that just has {disfmarker} No doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that I'm not very coherent about , but that just has your major buttons for {disfmarker} that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off , project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: channel changing . marketing: And maybe that spatially divides it , so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it , but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here , all the {disfmarker} whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together , project manager: Mm . industrial designer: N that way {disfmarker} Yeah . marketing: 'cause then you like , I don't even know what I'm turning on . project manager: Mm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day . marketing: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . project manager: Okay , so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things . industrial designer: Um . project manager: Because that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the T_V_s no longer have as well . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So like you have to have them somewhere , industrial designer: Mm . user interface: Yeah . project manager: 'cause you're gonna m need those special functions occasionally . Um but not necessarily on the m the normal remote . industrial designer: Right . user interface: Can I ask , are we designing a remote control for a television only project manager: {vocalsound} Good question . user interface: um , and if if this device is just to be used for the television would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ? project manager: {vocalsound} I don't know that yet . user interface: Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ? industrial designer: Mm . project manager: It's a good question . Um . {vocalsound} I'll look into that . marketing: Mm-hmm hmm . project manager: If I can . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: I think it's just T_V_ , I mean , if it {disfmarker} if we're taking it just {gap} new product a new television remote control that's not like {vocalsound} doesn't say . industrial designer: Mm yeah . marketing: You know , things might be more advanced than that . {vocalsound} project manager: Mm . user interface: {vocalsound} So we should {disfmarker} maybe we should assume that i t it's just a television that we're wanting to control . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Well , I mean I suppose it would be nice to have {vocalsound} playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well I I don't know if that works technologically or not . industrial designer: Yes . I guess we have to define what what we're aiming for . If it's just a television then that {disfmarker} it's a bit simpler , 'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it . user interface: Yeah . marketing: It's an idea with the buttons being really {gap} . industrial designer: Large . If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Mm . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay . 'Kay sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas . Mind if we move on ? Ps industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: mm okay . user interface: 'Kay . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes . I believe we've actually been only working on this this one for about twenty , so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um , industrial designer: Hmm . project manager: but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually . Um the industrial design , Alima will be doing um the working design . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Um the User Interface Designer , that's for {gap} . Technical functions , I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons . Um user requirements um , so you'll be hearing about different trends , uh about different things that people need , um I guess kind of the same uh discussion that we've been having , we'll get from the actual consum s consumers . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Mm 'kay um . And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach . I realised in this past one we we didn't have much , we just wanted to get a little brain-storming done . Um so very exited to see all your animals and how {disfmarker} what wonderful um artists we all are {vocalsound} um . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Any questions ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: What we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting ? Do we know that ? project manager: I haven't gotten an agenda yet , um I'll put that together . I'm sure as we'll each get our own instruction user interface: Right . project manager: and then um because what we gonna do is first our individual actions and then we'll come back together . So I'm sure we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time user interface: Yep . industrial designer: 'Kay . user interface: Yep . industrial designer: I'm sure we'll be busy . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Mm 'kay um I'll type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you . Um just including all the things that we talked about . Um . user interface: Okay . Can you e-mail your slides as well ? Is that possible ? project manager: Yes , I yes , I think I can . Mm-hmm . user interface: Cool project manager: I'll just attach it to an email . And you're you're number two , industrial designer: I'm two . project manager: three , four ? marketing: I'm four . project manager: Is that correct ? Okay . industrial designer: Alright . project manager: Excellent . It was lovely meeting you all . user interface: 'Kay project manager: Just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails . {vocalsound} industrial designer: 'Kay . project manager: Let me see if I can do that right now .
