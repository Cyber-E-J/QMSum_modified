project manager: {vocalsound} So let's start our second me meeting on {vocalsound} conceptual design . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: So , marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: as the previous meeting I will be the secretary industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first uh {disfmarker} marketing: No y you do the minutes first , or ? project manager: What ? marketing: No ? project manager: I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan . marketing: Okay . user interface: Yep . project manager: So , we'll {disfmarker} S user interface: Yeah . project manager: technical accessoire ? user interface: No no no . project manager: Interface ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: This . user interface: Mm . So uh first I will present the concept of user interface . Um there's three concepts in the user interface . So first one it's a Google controller . The second is a fancy controller . The last one is uh intelligent controller . So there are three concepts in our controller . Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller . Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . Uh this is a first concept of our controller . The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um industrial designer: Mm . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: A nice one . user interface: attractive . Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides . project manager: {vocalsound} I'm not sure the one in the middle {vocalsound} is very attractive . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , it's very , you know project manager: {vocalsound} It's very big , user interface: if you're {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . {vocalsound} Or to recognise it , marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . user interface: yeah . project manager: Yeah , why not . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: We'll have big discussion I suppose after that , industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: so . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Mm . user interface: So the last uh concept is intelligent . We want uh we want our controller to be smart , industrial designer: Mm-hmm . marketing: Mm . user interface: so maybe we should uh use um uh technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . Um With this advanced features we {disfmarker} I think we can attract a lot of user . project manager: Okay . Something else ? user interface: Okay . No . There {disfmarker} this is the three concepts of our controller . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , {vocalsound} you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , user interface: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? user interface: Yeah , so {disfmarker} project manager: Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? user interface: Y marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe . project manager: or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ? user interface: Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . project manager: Yeah , sure . user interface: For example , if you cannot find your uh {vocalsound} controller , you can just uh {vocalsound} just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two . project manager: I industrial designer: Oh yeah , {vocalsound} that's a good {disfmarker} that's a good point , so . project manager: That's true . {vocalsound} industrial designer: One and {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , but suppose you got a cold . You have a mute remote controller . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Mm . user interface: So you can use your gesture . That's no problem . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah but how how is {disfmarker} how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? project manager: Broken arm ? user interface: For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . Okay . project manager: Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yep . {vocalsound} marketing: But this this {disfmarker} but this would never happen anyway . project manager: Why ? user interface: Yeah , they cannot speak at the same time . project manager: If you have one brother and one sister marketing: Yeah {disfmarker} project manager: and they want to watch their favourite uh T_V_ programme , marketing: Yeah , but the {disfmarker} project manager: so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah but {vocalsound} Yeah user interface: Yeah , it's very interesting . {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah but this {disfmarker} project manager: so . industrial designer: but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: because the {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , marketing: I don't think it {disfmarker} project manager: but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you . industrial designer: {vocalsound} That's right . project manager: You're not you're not obliged to share it . marketing: Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff . project manager: Yeah , we can {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: Yeah , that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller . Even you h you have the controller , I can {vocalsound} I can say channel three , industrial designer: {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} it's {gap} {vocalsound} marketing: No . user interface: so it's c come to channel three , marketing: No , but this is disadvant disadvantage . user interface: I don't have to {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage . user interface: It's advantage . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to project manager: Yeah , but one other question . industrial designer: manual controllers , eh . project manager: How how much will it cost ? industrial designer: No , more expensive maybe . user interface: How much ? project manager: Yeah . Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working . user interface: No no we we d we we just are use um {disfmarker} project manager: Some some efficient . marketing: Uh if you if if you use the basic {disfmarker} user interface: No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field . project manager: So you think it won't cost an {disfmarker} Not a lot for us ? Or ? user interface: Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition , it's very {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , but uh uh {disfmarker} user interface: it's uh {disfmarker} yeah . It's {disfmarker} marketing: But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . Because then you need uh {disfmarker} I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition , for example . industrial designer: Well y y you have also the language problem , user interface: No it's uh {disfmarker} Even for the f um because the the vocabulary {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} industrial designer: you know when you {disfmarker} project manager: Mm-mm . industrial designer: 'Cause it it have to be universal , project manager: Yeah . I agree with uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: so . user interface: The vocabulary is very small , so that's not a problem . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: remote control . We need something that is international . Suppose we're {disfmarker} we want to sell it in France . user interface: Yeah . project manager: The recognition system will be able to understand French . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English , user interface: Yeah . project manager: so . user interface: Yeah , the key , the key um the key of our {disfmarker} the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation marketing: Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah but you know . The product {disfmarker} The pro user interface: mechanism . It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French . industrial designer: {vocalsound} It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe {vocalsound} project manager: Mm , okay . marketing: Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , project manager: And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? user interface: it's {disfmarker} industrial designer: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . But {disfmarker} user interface: Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed . project manager: Yeah , but how will you {disfmarker} user interface: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: If you have the language , you have to develop for each country . marketing: Mm . user interface: Oh n Yeah , yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation . industrial designer: Yeah , but for each country you have to do one , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: because uh the for example for Se {vocalsound} user interface: Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to {disfmarker} industrial designer: Oh really ? {vocalsound} That's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Oh . marketing: Yeah , project manager: Seems to be quite complex . marketing: but then w Yeah , industrial designer: Comple user interface: No , it's not so complex {vocalsound} . marketing: we have to take care of the twelve Euros project manager: And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ? marketing: problem . project manager: And where will be they ? Do you think if we're far from television it will work ? user interface: No no no it's not {disfmarker} I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . It it just {disfmarker} the microphone is embedded in the controller . project manager: Yeah , but where is the controller ? marketing: Okay . user interface: Where is the controller ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: It's in your family , in your home . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah , but we're {disfmarker} marketing: No , but then it's it's like this uh {disfmarker} project manager: here it's uh an object . But here you say you want to use i uh s technology . user interface: Yeah . Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here . industrial designer: A microphone maybe . project manager: Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object . industrial designer: To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe . project manager: You just want to interact with television . user interface: Yeah yeah just {disfmarker} you just put the controller here , then you industrial designer: I if you say one , he switch to channel , user interface: you use your command project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , industrial designer: yeah . user interface: and you do s your gesture . project manager: but you can lose it . {vocalsound} user interface: No no it's n y {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if you lose it {disfmarker} industrial designer: So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay you {disfmarker} so you can build a kind of black box industrial designer: Devic project manager: and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone {vocalsound} inside your remote control . project manager: Ah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: But you would still have the buttons . Or is it {disfmarker} do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? user interface: think it {disfmarker} we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think {disfmarker} marketing: Okay , so you {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , user interface: yeah . marketing: yeah . user interface: You can see {disfmarker} they can switch form one modality to another . project manager: Mm . marketing: Yeah , I dunno . It's a bit risky risky . project manager: I think so . industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: No , project manager: And maybe it will be quite {disfmarker} user interface: that's quite inter quite attractive . industrial designer: But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so {disfmarker} although y y user interface: Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , industrial designer: Yeah but i i {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} marketing: I dunno . user interface: We should have confidence in technology . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , we should . {vocalsound} Uh . project manager: Hmm . So , what do you think ? We'll try the controllers you'd prefer . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: What ? project manager: Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? marketing: If if {disfmarker} I mean , uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . user interface: More features , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , but {disfmarker} marketing: But if if if it like doubles uh industrial designer: I think he need a control that is very reliable , marketing: no one would would be interested . industrial designer: so . project manager: So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ? Hmm ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Just want to have something {disfmarker} controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . You think it's possible ? user interface: Yeah but if if you stick to um {disfmarker} stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . marketing: Yeah . No , user interface: Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that {disfmarker} marketing: I mean {disfmarker} industrial designer: It's not really the {disfmarker} we marketing: Y industrial designer: we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so {disfmarker} or something like that . But uh I think a user need {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function , marketing: No , user interface: but {disfmarker} marketing: but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something , industrial designer: Don't have a {disfmarker} the the {disfmarker} Yeah user interface: Okay . marketing: or {disfmarker} industrial designer: if we can send email from it . user interface: But it's not the {disfmarker} only the problem {disfmarker} only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ . marketing: No . No . industrial designer: Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if {disfmarker} marketing: Cause for example {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but uh we want so user interface: but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . marketing: Yeah , you wou you would {disfmarker} user interface: That's {disfmarker} marketing: True . user interface: the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our {disfmarker} from other products . project manager: Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . industrial designer: Yeah {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} And for all the person of the family maybe , user interface: Yeah , uh {disfmarker} project manager: You don't need to tune it . industrial designer: so , yeah . user interface: Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ? project manager: Yeah , why not ? If it's {disfmarker} marketing: I mean , for example the goo y industrial designer: Because you have new {disfmarker} marketing: you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . marketing: I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . Google is {vocalsound} is simple , works fine , user interface: Yeah . marketing: so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot . user interface: Yeah . Oh yes , but there's no big difference between the traditional controller . marketing: Uh thi this {disfmarker} I mean , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition user interface: The {disfmarker} then nn marketing: or {disfmarker} user interface: no . marketing: if he has something that works fine and is really {vocalsound} fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use . user interface: Tha project manager: Not too expensive too . user interface: But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller . marketing: See {vocalsound} {disfmarker} user interface: That's the same {disfmarker} marketing: That's the problem , user interface: yeah . marketing: yeah . I mean , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Ye {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . marketing: But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product user interface: Yeah . marketing: and so . project manager: Okay . So marketing: I mean , that's the point . project manager: let's go to the Industrial Designer . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Okay . project manager: Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that , so . industrial designer: Okay . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Two ? industrial designer: Yeah , participant two um {disfmarker} project manager: Working ? industrial designer: Yeah , working design , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: so . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: So I think {disfmarker} project manager: I can {disfmarker} industrial designer: Can you go to the {vocalsound} next one ? I uh {disfmarker} it's not this one . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: It's uh oth the oth {vocalsound} so I {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: It's the working design . Sorry . {vocalsound} Component design . project manager: It's okay {vocalsound} industrial designer: So this yeah {disfmarker} so this is the described use {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: What ? Are you inst project manager: Uh I think there's something wrong with your {disfmarker} user interface: It did didn't r receive it . Didn't receive it . project manager: Maybe you you record it somewhere else . industrial designer: I don't think so . user interface: Participant one . Participant one . project manager: Interface concept . No . marketing: Hmm . project manager: Mm mm . industrial designer: Oh . Maybe I record recorded directly on the {disfmarker} Computer . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Uh . {vocalsound} Nope . {vocalsound} marketing: Dunno . industrial designer: Okay , okay . Yes . project manager: It seems that we have a problem with the {disfmarker} marketing: I dunno if you remember what you had to say or {disfmarker} industrial designer: I can say it to you without . project manager: Yeah , so {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , maybe we can first come to project manager: No , I think it will be more interesting to start with uh {disfmarker} user interface: uh to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides , marketing: I think it's more interesting what he says , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , user interface: then present it later . marketing: okay . industrial designer: exac marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: You will had s some more information in {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . project manager: I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , true . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . user interface: Okay . {vocalsound} industrial designer: In fact , I don't know , project manager: So . Okay . industrial designer: I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay , never mind . industrial designer: so {disfmarker} It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r user interface: Okay . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: of the remote control . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside user interface: Okay . Okay . industrial designer: and {disfmarker} so . So I {disfmarker} in fact the the {disfmarker} f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: so will {disfmarker} it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . So and {vocalsound} in which which which kind will be the the different bu button , project manager: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , project manager: Mm-hmm . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: or , you know , you can see them in the darkness . project manager: Okay . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation user interface: Uh-huh . industrial designer: or will it be a battery like the classical battery so . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come user interface: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . industrial designer: and {disfmarker} so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . project manager: Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah , yeah mm . project manager: and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers industrial designer: Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . marketing: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: no ? industrial designer: Alrigh In fact , having them both will {disfmarker} if we want to have battery , regular battery and and {vocalsound} the solar energy battery it could be {disfmarker} it'll it will add a little bit of the price , project manager: So . industrial designer: but it will be an added value also that will be compensated , marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so hmm . project manager: And what tha what about the uh materials ? industrial designer: And the materials , it depends for example you {disfmarker} if you have a wooden material it can be more {disfmarker} the plastic material is more common project manager: Impersonal , mm-hmm . industrial designer: it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Special for {disfmarker} industrial designer: or you know , you can have some {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , and i if you {disfmarker} we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Mm-hmm . Mm . industrial designer: and it can be interesting . project manager: Mm okay , seems to be interesting , mm . industrial designer: And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . project manager: Yeah , we want something easy to use and {disfmarker} so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough . industrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . project manager: And you think that we will be {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so . project manager: So wood . industrial designer: {gap} project manager: And what about the buttons ? industrial designer: I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know {vocalsound} lighted buttons because , you know , it's {disfmarker} I don't know {vocalsound} um yeah , in the dark , it's fashion project manager: No it's fashion , yeah . industrial designer: and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right . marketing: What about the touch scr touch screen ? For example . It's it's expensive I I guess . industrial designer: {vocalsound} I think a touch screen {vocalsound} will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so . marketing: Mm . industrial designer: But {disfmarker} And it is a kind of other design , I mean . It can also be interesting to have this kind of {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: So you got email ? project manager: I dunno . {vocalsound} I think we have only {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh five minutes left . marketing: Okay . project manager: Participant four ? Functional requirements ? marketing: Uh no , trend watching . {vocalsound} The other one . {vocalsound} project manager: This one ? marketing: Yeah . Uh , I think so , just {disfmarker} Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and {disfmarker} I mean {vocalsound} i i it sounds good technically user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Mm . marketing: but it's it's not what they want and uh {disfmarker} So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . project manager: Okay . marketing: At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis . industrial designer: {gap} marketing: Now i if we look at fashion in general um {disfmarker} Okay . Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , industrial designer: Ah yes . marketing: okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . Okay , yeah . marketing: 'Cause it's it's really what people want . Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris industrial designer: And fruit and vegetables yeah . marketing: we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , industrial designer: {vocalsound} Spongy {vocalsound} 'Kay . marketing: okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design . industrial designer: Okay , yeah , yeah . marketing: I dunno . industrial designer: Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? marketing: Yeah thi this is this would be like um industrial designer: Pla S marketing: plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh industrial designer: Very stuff {disfmarker} Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . Yeah . marketing: device , so um industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: So we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . So , {vocalsound} as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and {disfmarker} with battery would be something interesting , industrial designer: Yeah . Solar . marketing: Yeah , so when I think it's {disfmarker} industrial designer: Okay . project manager: maybe will attract industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm industrial designer: It will be a {disfmarker} project manager: pro-ecology consumers . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well . industrial designer: Yeah , I think {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah . Yeah . project manager: Case . user interface: Later ? {vocalsound} project manager: So you think {gap} case . Something spongy . {vocalsound} Someth no wood . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} No wood but {disfmarker} Plastic ? marketing: Maybe not no wood , but I mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know . industrial designer: Would some {disfmarker} user interface: Pla project manager: Maybe you {disfmarker} industrial designer: I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . It depends on the design we want , marketing: Yeah , maybe the base . industrial designer: so . project manager: It's it's natural . marketing: But still y project manager: Th The feeling is natural , industrial designer: Yeah , it's natural marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: and i project manager: so maybe we can stay with wood . industrial designer: And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol marketing: Yeah , I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view . industrial designer: Mm , yeah , it's not right , so . project manager: But it's still fashion . marketing: But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , industrial designer: Okay . marketing: or project manager: Yeah , marketing: I dunno . project manager: something that you can {vocalsound} into it . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Uh and what about the user interface concept ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} Google and {disfmarker} project manager: Google and fancy ? industrial designer: and fancy , f how about the the voice ? {vocalsound} And {vocalsound} project manager: Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . industrial designer: Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested user interface: Uh yes . industrial designer: and how {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It It is an an interesting concept to see {disfmarker} to have uh voice control . marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: Mm . Yeah . user interface: The smart controller . {vocalsound} industrial designer: But {disfmarker} and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , industrial designer: so . project manager: but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice . industrial designer: But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so . project manager: That's true . marketing: Yeah {disfmarker} d user interface: Okay . project manager: So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , marketing: I dunno . user interface: Mm . project manager: maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . user interface: Yeah . It's good . project manager: And L_C_D_ buttons . industrial designer: Yeah , L_C_D_ . project manager: Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah , yeah . And pf what can we think a supplement to {disfmarker} marketing: What interface ? project manager: Yeah , for the interface something {disfmarker} added value . industrial designer: I think the supplement can be the voice {vocalsound} . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of {disfmarker} project manager: With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . project manager: commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers . industrial designer: Yeah . Mm . user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: To push button , yeah , yeah . Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four . project manager: Turning the T_V_ o on o or off . industrial designer: Yeah , turning {vocalsound} {disfmarker} yeah , yeah . Not very complex commands , but easy commands , project manager: So , industrial designer: so . project manager: adding some vocal commands . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Simple ones ? industrial designer: Yeah , simple ones for {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes {vocalsound} so {vocalsound} we'll {disfmarker} you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yep . Yeah . project manager: Uh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} expensive buttons {gap} {vocalsound} Yeah , to make some new {disfmarker} project manager: and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too . marketing: Yeah , no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Okay , fruits . project manager: Yeah . marketing: If possible . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really {disfmarker} it will be seen in the remote control . industrial designer: Need it to be , okay . project manager: So you will have {disfmarker} Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay . project manager: so you will have to model model something . user interface: Okay . Yep project manager: And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: So , user interface: Okay . project manager: no more questions , we can close the session . industrial designer: Sounds good , mm-hmm . marketing: Hmm . project manager: Yeah . Okay , cool . marketing: Okay .
