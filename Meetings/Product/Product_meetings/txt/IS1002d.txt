project manager: Uh 'kay . So {disfmarker} marketing: So so so . user interface: Put on your mic . industrial designer: {vocalsound} So you forgot how this works again ? user interface: Boss . project manager: Yep . industrial designer: {gap} Boss . marketing: Maybe . Maybe maybe maybe . project manager: Okay so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , 'kay ? user interface: Yep . project manager: And here's the agenda for this meeting . Uh I'm just gonna open , say a few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . You guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product that I can see some demonstrations of over there . Looks cool . And then we're gonna evaluate it . marketing: {vocalsound} Bra user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Then we're gonna talk about finance , and I've got a lovely Excel spreadsheet that I knocked up in the last five minutes for this . And uh industrial designer: {vocalsound} Hmm you knocked it up ? project manager: yep . And {vocalsound} we're gonna evaluate the product and close . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Got forty minutes to do this in . We should be fine . Let's try and keep this one on schedule . user interface: Alright . project manager: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Your thing is in {disfmarker} where is it ? Is it in {disfmarker} user interface: Three , three . industrial designer: Thi third third third . The end product thingy . Yeah . project manager: Who wants it ? user interface: Pedro can have it . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: I like {disfmarker} industrial designer: {gap} . user interface: I'll help talk . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Um yeah so what we ended up with . Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department , which is us , is uh fifteen point eight Euros , user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: someone forgot the {vocalsound} units there user interface: Unit price . industrial designer: yeah , uh unit price {disfmarker} unit production price cost thing . Um we implemented the basic functions , which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator , which was one of the marketing things , cradle , scroll wheel for uh the {vocalsound} the channels , and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll . project manager: Zapping your favourite channels , eh ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Scrolling through your favourites list . project manager: Oh okay okay . industrial designer: Zapping you know zapping . project manager: Ah 'kay okay , that's favourites . industrial designer: Maybe it's just a Portuguese thing {vocalsound} . And um yeah that was the result . project manager: Ah 'kay . I like the the the the logo on there as well . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: It's very prominent {vocalsound} . project manager: It is very prominent . So this is the {disfmarker} user interface: So {vocalsound} here I'll give you the {disfmarker} so this is the cradle unit , and this is the actual remote itself . Um so the scroll bar is {disfmarker} or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here , um and then the volume controls are here and here . project manager: Okay . user interface: Uh you've got the keypad which is the numbers uh f from zero to nine and then ten . This is the power button . Uh we have our um {vocalsound} we have the enter button and uh what was the other button here ? This is the teletext . industrial designer: Start s the the start uh to to to user interface: The programme button , industrial designer: programme yeah . project manager: Ah , okay I see . user interface: yeah the programme button . So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming {vocalsound} your uh the um the type of television you wanna use . So um the plastic is the white area of this {disfmarker} of the model here , and the red area is like a rubber covering . project manager: It's pretty cool . user interface: So you can see that when it lays like this or like this {disfmarker} and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um {disfmarker} project manager: Is that {disfmarker} could that be easy to {disfmarker} for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ? user interface: Yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem , but if you drop it {disfmarker} industrial designer: Not helping {vocalsound} . project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: yeah {vocalsound} . project manager: Oh well I guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it . user interface: Yeah and it depends on if it's sliding , but I think it's pretty ergonomic . You can feel it . project manager: Mm . Feels good . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well . user interface: Yeah of course . Well this is clay {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah it's kinda cool . You have to reach a little bit don't you . user interface: Yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach , but I think we might scale down the final model a bit . project manager: Ah yeah that wouldn't make sense . user interface: {vocalsound} These {disfmarker} this is a bit larger than it would be , but {disfmarker} project manager: It's cool . I'm impressed . industrial designer: Don't have no one to handle that . user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: And hold it so {vocalsound} {disfmarker} marketing: Mm that's {disfmarker} project manager: wh what's the marketing perspective ? marketing: oh that's {disfmarker} oh I like it . I mean you guys gave me more than I was asking for , so I'm happy because we've got some really marketable features in this . Yeah I think it's good . Good good good job . user interface: Mm Pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability . industrial designer: Yeah . So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote . user interface: Beep beep beep . marketing: {vocalsound} Uh pla user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: The locator function . marketing: I'm ha project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: It's great . That's great . It's a great feature . user interface: Um beep beep beep {vocalsound} project manager: Mm it's impressing . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Wicked isn't it ? {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} So let me get it , user interface: so {vocalsound} project manager: if I press this button {disfmarker} user interface: beep beep beep {vocalsound} project manager: I see . That's pretty cool . Hang on . {vocalsound} user interface: beep beep beep {vocalsound} be shut up . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: So you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town {disfmarker} user interface: Beep beep beep {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I plan to do that as well . user interface: okay . Um no no no tha that's alri project manager: {vocalsound} So the the two blue {disfmarker} are are those for the the it to charge off of {disfmarker} in ? user interface: Exactly that's exactly what those are for . project manager: Ah okay okay . user interface: And um there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , is um {disfmarker} you could industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} user interface: beep beep beep {vocalsound} {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah {vocalsound} it's the right shape isn't it ? user interface: it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there , but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there . And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so {disfmarker} project manager: But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , user interface: Mm . project manager: 'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides {gap} . user interface: Right . So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit , project manager: Okay . user interface: but {disfmarker} marketing: Uh , I can see that . project manager: But it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that , hasn't it ? user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Yep I like . Good job . project manager: So is that the the final colour scheme as well or ? marketing: {vocalsound} No no . user interface: Oh no this is {vocalsound} just what we had to work with at the time . project manager: Okay . user interface: So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people . project manager: The {disfmarker} hmm . user interface: {vocalsound} Careful . project manager: It came off . The scroll wheels , {gap} a problem with them not being sort of {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: I don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore . marketing: Well I mean of course , I mean {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: My my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions . project manager: Mm . marketing: You know some blend of silvers and blacks . user interface: {vocalsound} Beep beep beep . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Okay enough of that . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Well i it's cool guys . 'Kay so are we done with the this presentation ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Ja . project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Now now . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: So you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there I gotta do mine up at the board . project manager: Have you ? Okay . marketing: Yeah yeah . So {vocalsound} {disfmarker} project manager: Can I not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now ? marketing: No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it . project manager: Oh I see I see . marketing: I couldn't create it in the PowerPoint , project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: and I think I've got this really strange cable . So what I had , basically going from the PowerPoint format , is that uh yeah yeah I like this a lot . Is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room ? project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Nah . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: So what we had is we had the method . That's not how you spell method , is it ? user interface: No way . project manager: {vocalsound} marketing: No A_ {vocalsound} . {gap} . {vocalsound} So this doesn't go so fast this way . And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh . And uh to me with this product we got uh {disfmarker} we got {vocalsound} basically three things to market . We've got the features , we have the uh characteristics , and we have the {vocalsound} I I don't know what we would call the other part {disfmarker} what we call you know the the {vocalsound} the corp corporate {disfmarker} Help me . The the corporation stands behind the product , okay . So the features I think {vocalsound} we got the scroll , we've got the uh the locator , we've got the durability , we've got the dependability , industrial designer: It fell off . marketing: we've got you know the features that make this a unique product . Um user interface: Beep beep beep . marketing: {vocalsound} the characteristics I talk about , we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive . Uh and the corporation , we're talking about {disfmarker} we're we're a new we're a new company . We're wanting to make a name for ourself . We're wanting you to uh find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price . One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , which means that this product , for the for the life of of {disfmarker} the life use , if it should have a technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ? That was something I would be interested in . Um so {vocalsound} yeah without uh going into great details , we have a we have a product , it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , I believe , to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros . We're gonna be competitive , and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche . Um w project manager: Do you {disfmarker} would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ? marketing: That that would be uh that would be I think a decision best made by corporate um I I m for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , I th I think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense . project manager: Mm-hmm . Mm 'kay . marketing: But I'm sh I'm sure open to to market this in either direction . But you guys came up with a great product , and at that cost I think it uh {disfmarker} there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only . Uh that's the only that's the only drawback I see to this . But with all of these other features I think people c {vocalsound} one thing I'm I'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice . There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my {disfmarker} but I like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back . project manager: And we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway , aren't we ? Th there's no fundamentally different technology to do that . marketing: {vocalsound} Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ? project manager: Hmm . marketing: You know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone . You know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after {vocalsound} {disfmarker} industrial designer: W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but {disfmarker} user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Mm-hmm , but you follow what I'm s I'm s industrial designer: We we w yeah we could get another version of it that actually works . But uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we're {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything , but that's that was just an idea I had . Uh to me the only additions {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less {disfmarker} b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , you know what they do , it's very simple , and it just works . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Mm there's a risk of that . marketing: Yep . But anyway that's uh {disfmarker} project manager: Okay so we can talk about finance now . So I have a little spreadsheet for us where {disfmarker} I I was wondering , you {disfmarker} when you talked about the fifteen point eight Euros , I was wondering how you came up with that figure ? user interface: Well , that was just just our technical team added up the um production costs of the individual units . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Okay so I have bit of a spreadsheet here for this . {vocalsound} Now user interface: Oh . industrial designer: Very co very colf colourful . project manager: I've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros , user interface: {vocalsound} Uh-huh . project manager: equivalent to solar cells , which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already . user interface: Uh-huh . project manager: Uh {vocalsound} and I'm assuming that the locator beacon , the you know the {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: beep beep beep . project manager: {vocalsound} Can be made for {disfmarker} it sounded different that time {disfmarker} uh can be made for a similar price to uh an L_C_ display , user interface: Oh , sorry . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: uh an uh {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh do you think that's fair coming from a {disfmarker} m the manufacturing ? user interface: Yeah um I do think we that we we {vocalsound} uh don't need the events chip on print , we only need the uh the regular chip on print , project manager: {gap} . Okay . user interface: so there may have been a m miscalculation in there . project manager: Yep . Okay . So we're down to sixteen point four , yeah . user interface: And we and we have a single-curved uh {disfmarker} project manager: Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved ? user interface: Uh I think that {disfmarker} project manager: We're not entirely sure what single-curve versus double-cur marketing: {vocalsound} We've got a we've got a curve and a droop . I don't know whether that {vocalsound} . user interface: It's single-curved , project manager: You think ? Okay user interface: yeah . project manager: I'm {gap} convinced . But we save one Euro that way , yeah ? So we come {disfmarker} bring it down to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Fifteen point four . user interface: See it's a little bit more than f single-curved . So yeah it's fifteen point eight , that's where we came up with it {vocalsound} . project manager: {vocalsound} Well hang on . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Do don't speak so {disfmarker} it's in here , in that {vocalsound} user interface: Okay . project manager: w do we have any {disfmarker} we have special form don't we ? user interface: Yeah we do . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So that's {disfmarker} yeah . user interface: Ah . What do you know {vocalsound} . project manager: But the the the {disfmarker} we haven't talked about any special colour though uh I don't th user interface: {vocalsound} Oh it's {vocalsound} a that's not very special , it's pretty {disfmarker} project manager: if we're going for greys and silvers then I don't think we're {disfmarker} {vocalsound} O okay so we're {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} If th {vocalsound} . project manager: Push-button , scroll wheel , we're {disfmarker} basically we have uh th industrial designer: We don't {disfmarker} project manager: is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ? user interface: That's a scroll . industrial designer: It's a scroll . project manager: Just a scroll ? It's not one of the scrolls where , for example , with this one you could push it down to be a button ? user interface: Uh no we just use it as a scroll . marketing: Ooh . project manager: Okay then we have fifteen point eight Euros . user interface: It was a pretty accurate estimate I would say . project manager: {vocalsound} It wasn't bad . industrial designer: Yes . user interface: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound} . industrial designer: We're wicked . Awesome . project manager: Okay so we're on to the {disfmarker} user interface: S 's kind of s frighteningly accurate {vocalsound} . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation , where we have a look at the criterias th that Paul {vocalsound} the criterion criteria that Paul has has given us {vocalsound} , and we can use that to tell {disfmarker} How's it going ? {vocalsound} Anyone got any thoughts ? user interface: What ? project manager: How how have we done today ? user interface: I think we did pretty well . project manager: I think we did pretty well too . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: That looks pretty spectacular . marketing: No , I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept . project manager: Any other chang uh thoughts ? Okay so th th what about um room for creativity ? marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Is it the {gap} . industrial designer: That was mm-hmm {disfmarker} user interface: Sh I think there was plenty of room . project manager: I {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: I think we we ended up being quite creative there . user interface: We got a couple innovative i marketing: Yeah user interface: Couple innovative ideas . marketing: well we we we kinda broke {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us project manager: Mm . marketing: because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right , user interface: Mm-hmm . industrial designer: No . marketing: we raised the price of it , we've added two t new technology to it . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So you know you know if this thing flies then we've we've adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us . project manager: Not every idea necessarily , industrial designer: Basically . project manager: it's still a remote control {vocalsound} . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah yeah yeah yeah . project manager: Uh no yeah but {disfmarker} we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess , industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: but the uh {disfmarker} marketing: But I like {disfmarker} I mean when I say we have we had {disfmarker} I believe we have room for creativity 'cause w this is {disfmarker} we did it . project manager: 'Kay leadership , what do we report back to the bosses ? No th th I think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing . user interface: Yep . industrial designer: It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was project manager: I agree . industrial designer: Teamwork . marketing: Cohesive yeah . project manager: Synergy . user interface: {vocalsound} There was a lot of synergy . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Yes synergistic yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Teamwork , yeah he is uh . marketing: Yeah . project manager: What did we think of the meeting room , I guess is an important thing here . Mm . user interface: These cables suck {vocalsound} . project manager: Yeah , this falls off industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and uh the white board worked really well without any pro user interface: Yep . industrial designer: And that's {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: D you must have very long shirts . That's way far down lapel mic . project manager: Mm-mm , lapel . Wha okay , oh , alright {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Lapel lapel lapel {vocalsound} . user interface: Lapel . industrial designer: That's almost a crotch {vocalsound} mi cr {vocalsound} project manager: That's it's down , it's quite close . marketing: {vocalsound} You know you know what they're gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting you know th {vocalsound} project manager: Keep it , keep it calm . {vocalsound} Oh dear {vocalsound} . No more pizza for me {vocalsound} . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Oh dear oh dear {vocalsound} . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: So yeah the the pen came in alright and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works . industrial designer: 'Cause this is {disfmarker} you were using it o upside down . Still that {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} That's our boss {vocalsound} . project manager: {vocalsound} Nah , I'm I'm not convinced of that at all . marketing: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: I've been wor I've been wondering about that all day , but see these look like they're {disfmarker} that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around , industrial designer: Use them like that . user interface: Pedro's right . project manager: but it feels more comfortable , wh what you call upside-down . user interface: Pedro's right . project manager: I don't care . Uh okay so that data might be slightly invalid . What new ideas have we found ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Oh wel marketing: New ideas f uh for the product or for the the the the environment or {disfmarker} project manager: Well let's do both then . marketing: what are we ta project manager: Uh for the product ? user interface: Well we had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the r uh remote call feature . marketing: Oh . project manager: Yeah we came up with quite a bit . industrial designer: Bunch of new ideas . project manager: And for the meeting room , Has anyone got any more {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice . project manager: Yeah less sore on the ears . marketing: Well I I mean {disfmarker} industrial designer: Mm . marketing: clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables , but I'm sure that there's there's some justification for these things that I don't know about . And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: It's not been uh it's not been cooperating so well , but {vocalsound} I don't think that's the that's avoidable . industrial designer: Coulda been worse . project manager: Okay {vocalsound} so {disfmarker} Are the costs within the budget ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: Mm n {vocalsound} no . project manager: Nope . marketing: No . project manager: Oh hang on it really {disfmarker} that's something we {disfmarker} that the costs were under twelve fifty Euros . No requirements are changed . We're still under twenty Euros to build , so we're good . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: And the costs within the budget ? Not the original budget , but they are now . Is the project evaluated ? Mm I think so yeah , then celebration as it says . industrial designer: Hooray . marketing: {vocalsound} Okay . industrial designer: Free coke provided at the cafeteria . project manager: Oh I don't know how that got there . user interface: All right . project manager: Uh anyway . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} Who wrote that one ? project manager: {vocalsound} Thank user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: Thanks guys . marketing: So we need to close this meeting , industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: yeah bravo . Congratulations . user interface: Good job guys . industrial designer: Cool . marketing: S I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on so let's close this and come back and {disfmarker} 'kay . project manager: Yeah , I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on too . Oh .
