project manager: So {disfmarker} Hello . {vocalsound} marketing: Good afternoon . Sorry I'm a little late . project manager: No problem . marketing: Got stuck in the traffic . project manager: Okay . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: That's possible on uh this time of day . Starts at three o'clock . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Yeah . project manager: Uh , let me see . Our fourth and last meeting . There he is . Yes . Okay this our last meeting . In this meeting we will discuss our final design . And we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . And then we're going to close the project today as well . So after this you will be uh free to go and uh spend all your money . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} project manager: And this uh design , detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . Um , in order to do that we have this agenda . We'll have the prototype presentation first . Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria . {vocalsound} Then we will look at the finance . Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . Because everything costs money , and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote . But we will see that later . Then we will do the project uh evaluation , and the closing after that . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: We've got forty minutes . So we will be finished at half past three . But first um we will do the {disfmarker} this is prototype presentation . So , if some yeah if somebody wants step forward . industrial designer: Okay . Well this is what me and Richard came up with . The default spot for the on-off button . The mute button just below that . Then there's the volume and channel selectors . Simple plus-minus button . Uh we thought of a help button . If you hold it and you press another button , uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen . Then there's the zero to {disfmarker} one to zero buttons . A button for teletext . A button for the subtitles . And the company logo . So it's rather simple prototype . And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it . project manager: Okay . marketing: Um , {vocalsound} is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ? user interface: So {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . industrial designer: Sure uh just pop in at any time . marketing: Um , when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page . user interface: Uh , that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh {disfmarker} So um {disfmarker} You put it uh {disfmarker} you um came in uh page uh one hundred . Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons . marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: And you {disfmarker} But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel . S so uh the shifting uh button . Uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext , and shifting uh down . So {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . Okay . Um {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: Okay . Uh but um I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple . Uh just a few buttons and large buttons . user interface: Oh yeah ? project manager: But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons . So I'm wondering if we if we neely {disfmarker} really need all of those buttons . user interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} industrial designer: I think if you look at most controls , they've got more buttons than this . project manager: That's right . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: And well the on-off button , it's it's a necessity . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: You can't drop that one . The volume and channel buttons , you need you obviously need those those . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice . So we could cancel that one . I think the help button really is necessary user interface: Yeah yeah . industrial designer: because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does . project manager: Mm . user interface: Uh , or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh {disfmarker} project manager: Long time . Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: If you put {disfmarker} user interface: But m Yeah . We disc discuss that already . But uh we think uh old people uh don't know that uh option . So uh they just put in uh put {vocalsound} press uh the button and uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . Okay . industrial designer: Well , {vocalsound} you can't leave out the number buttons I guess . project manager: Yeah . user interface: And uh {disfmarker} project manager: Uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary . industrial designer: And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Oh . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: So it's rather basic already . marketing: Yeah . Think so . That's what I pointed out earlier . If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here . project manager: Yep . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Okay . So we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there ? industrial designer: Yeah , they're {disfmarker} project manager: Just n normal plain buttons . user interface: Yeah . Yeah , industrial designer: It's rather hard to draw on the white-board . user interface: it {disfmarker} industrial designer: But they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and stuff . project manager: Yeah . 'Kay . user interface: Yeah yeah . Just to recognise it , so uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Just for recognition . user interface: Uh yeah and now we don't need uh LEDs or um {disfmarker} Y uh project manager: No . user interface: s some uh remote controls uh do it also , project manager: No . user interface: but um uh because we use the little display we don't uh have to use it . Uh so {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . Okay . industrial designer: So and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons . With a a different colour than the case . user interface: Nay . project manager: Yep . industrial designer: So they jump out . project manager: Okay . industrial designer: And uh that's about it . project manager: That's nice . Then because we only have thirty minutes left , I will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do . And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Mm . project manager: If we see {disfmarker} I don't know if I've filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see uh something wrong . I counted two batteries . But maybe we can also use one . I don't know if it's possible . marketing: Since it rechargeable . project manager: It's rechargeable . That's right . user interface: Yeah we can u just uh {gap} {disfmarker} project manager: Okay . That's two Euros off . {vocalsound} user interface: 'Kay . {vocalsound} project manager: We need the advanced chip . So there's not much to uh {vocalsound} to save there . industrial designer: Yep . project manager: {vocalsound} Here we have the single curves . Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro . Um , user interface: Mm . project manager: I don't know , but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . user interface: Yeah . project manager: I think we have to keep that . industrial designer: Yes . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Then we have the case material supplements . It's plastic . It's the cheapest one we need . So that's uh not much to save either . But then the biggest costs are the buttons . So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low . user interface: Okay . project manager: Because you have to {disfmarker} we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end . Um , user interface: Yeah . project manager: so if we {disfmarker} Let's fir first count the buttons we have now . user interface: Uh {disfmarker} Sixteen , I believe so . project manager: Because I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Sixteen . Nah , that will be even more then . Eighteen Euros . So , user interface: Uh seventeen . Uh with the help button . project manager: seventeen . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Um {disfmarker} project manager: Okay , including the help ? industrial designer: Yep . marketing: Damn . project manager: Yeah . Uh seventeen . user interface: Yeah . project manager: I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number long . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {gap} . industrial designer: Yep . project manager: That saves us uh one Euro already . 'Cause then we have got fifteen I think ? industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Wouldn't {disfmarker} project manager: Fifteen buttons . marketing: Yeah . No . That wouldn't be an option . project manager: And this is {disfmarker} marketing: Uh , d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ? project manager: No those are one , I think . user interface: Yeah . Where did uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: Well , think actually there're two buttons , user interface: Uh , it's just one button . marketing: aren't they ? user interface: But , um {disfmarker} Yeah . There were uh two uh for one big button . But they are uh more expensive than the small ones . Uh , yeah . So {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah but th it's not stated in this files . user interface: It's just a {gap} . project manager: So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing marketing: Well I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button . project manager: That's possibility as well . marketing: That would cut the cost . project manager: So {disfmarker} And it's good for the design as well . So you can make {disfmarker} Uh let's see . If you make this {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Looks a bit like uh a cross . {vocalsound} Plus . Min . user interface: But I don't don't know if if it's cheaper . project manager: Uh s yeah channel . user interface: So uh , project manager: Yeah w user interface: we've still got four buttons , but just um {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah th I think they count uh the materials . user interface: You got uh not not a butt button itself , but uh on the um {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah on the chip there . Yeah . user interface: Yeah . On the chip you've got still uh four uh four buttons . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: That's right . That's right . user interface: So {disfmarker} project manager: But I think because we have the advanced chip marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} we can just count this as one button . user interface: Yeah , but {disfmarker} marketing: {vocalsound} But , I think this really is four buttons anyhow . project manager: But {disfmarker} No but I think {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes . project manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros . Also the L_C_ display , I think it's , I think it's too expensive for the display we use . marketing: Yes . industrial designer: Uh that's that's a big cost . project manager: I think they uh try t industrial designer: If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip . project manager: That's right , but what's the big advantage of our remote then ? {vocalsound} marketing: Only the docking station , I guess . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Which isn't the {disfmarker} the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic . project manager: No . industrial designer: So it's not even taken into the price . project manager: That's extra . {vocalsound} That's extra . That's right . marketing: Maybe we should to a different supplier . project manager: {vocalsound} That's an option . marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: Poland . Something . {vocalsound} Polish supplier . Don't you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th uh these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as well . industrial designer: {vocalsound} We we could save money on it . But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ? user interface: {gap} . marketing: Yeah , that's what I'm wondering . {vocalsound} industrial designer: My mother can't even send send an S_M_S_ message . project manager: Yeah . That's a point . industrial designer: So {disfmarker} user interface: {vocalsound} Are we gonna buy a um a remote control uh when you can uh use it ? marketing: Um {disfmarker} user interface: So um {disfmarker} Yeah . We m uh we must um stay below the um below um twelve uh fifty or {disfmarker} Can't uh go um {disfmarker} project manager: Yep . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: No . marketing: Well , since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . Especially since we have those nice features . user interface: Nay . project manager: Yeah but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros . We don't have any more budget to develop it . user interface: Is it impossible to {disfmarker} industrial designer: The margin will get too small . Yeah . project manager: Yeah . So {disfmarker} user interface: But it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty . project manager: It is . If you leave out the L_C_ display . And if you use less buttons . Say {disfmarker} Or you can take the single chip . user interface: I don't think so . marketing: It would be a be a pretty rigid one . user interface: S Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: But , you can't use uh {disfmarker} industrial designer: Ten . project manager: There it is . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: But then w Good looking . user interface: Uh , wi with n Oh , with uh attractive uh o options . project manager: Yeah . user interface: So uh , you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty . So {disfmarker} project manager: I think it's uh difficult as well , marketing: Or b project manager: but {disfmarker} marketing: Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control . industrial designer: No remote . {vocalsound} project manager: Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . Then w user interface: Scroll-wheel's one . industrial designer: {vocalsound} That's {disfmarker} project manager: Because then we save ten buttons . user interface: No , it {disfmarker} project manager: Then we have five and one . user interface: Yeah . project manager: And and see . If we have this one and we've got the advanced {disfmarker} W uh , we're getting close . {vocalsound} industrial designer: We're getting closer . user interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} marketing: But how does scroll-wheel work here ? project manager: Then you will {disfmarker} Or maybe you can um scroll . If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display . Until you've got the right number , then you push it . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also . Integrated scroll-wheel push-button . project manager: Alright . It's gotta scroll and push . user interface: Mm . project manager: Okay but then you you can push uh some other button as well . marketing: But {disfmarker} Yeah . industrial designer: You could just not scroll for a half a second . project manager: Yeah . That's right . So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel . industrial designer: So you won't need a button . marketing: I think that would be like the end of our usability . project manager: {vocalsound} But it would definitely crop cost , a lot . user interface: D yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: And we need the battery . {vocalsound} And the regular chip is not possible ? It has to be advanced ? industrial designer: If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip , yes . project manager: It has to be advanced . Yeah . Okay . user interface: Hmm . project manager: And we can save a Euro by a flat design . That's an option we can {disfmarker} user interface: Ja ja . industrial designer: Yep . project manager: Then we're almost there . industrial designer: Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button . project manager: Yeah . So if we {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah , or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah but I think that's {disfmarker} That is a big advantage , user interface: So {disfmarker} Yeah {disfmarker} project manager: if we're {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah it's a big advantage . project manager: But {disfmarker} user interface: But um , it's {disfmarker} project manager: Can we use {disfmarker} can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ? user interface: Uh , yeah . industrial designer: I think so . Yeah . project manager: If you push it three times ? marketing: Well , think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are user interface: Yeah . marketing: right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight eight eight , project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: and teletext disappears . But the subtitles stay there . user interface: {gap} {disfmarker} But if you push the teletext button twice {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? Eight hundred eighty eight . {vocalsound} marketing: I think that's the case on most {disfmarker} user interface: It's uh {disfmarker} One m uh one b uh , a few buttons . project manager: Ah that's not really that {disfmarker} marketing: Well , that could be just uh like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click . industrial designer: Yeah . Okay . marketing: But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people , industrial designer: No . marketing: who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is . user interface: Yeah . project manager: No . marketing: Holding a remote with {vocalsound} which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: With only five buttons on it . And a scroll-wheel . project manager: I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . If you just make it real simple . Because it saves it saves a lot of money . And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen , which can provide extra information . How to use the scroll wheel . How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles . marketing: True . True . user interface: Hmm . project manager: And it's good for the innovative design as well . If you would erase these . Mm eraser ? And we put uh {disfmarker} Looks a bit odd maybe . {vocalsound} marketing: That's a pretty big scroll wheel . project manager: That is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Something like that . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Then , yeah . We've got the scroll-wheel . One , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one . And these are two buttons then . industrial designer: We could make two buttons out of that . And just um {disfmarker} If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: So that would save two buttons . If you do the same for the channel . project manager: Yeah . That's really a good good idea , I think . And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed . industrial designer: More obvious . project manager: So we make one for the volume , one for the channel . Plus scroll . That's right . industrial designer: So if we {disfmarker} project manager: So we've got one , two , three . Yeah , we can leave the teletext in if we want . That's m that's better . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . So {disfmarker} marketing: So this is five buttons . industrial designer: If we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case . And make it smaller overall . project manager: Y yeah . industrial designer: So if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button project manager: Mm yeah . Uh yeah , and then you can {disfmarker} industrial designer: you get a a much smaller remote . project manager: That's right . user interface: Uh yeah . industrial designer: And it sh project manager: So we can decrease this one to four buttons . industrial designer: Yeah ? marketing: Right now we have five . user interface: But uh , you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh just the same price as a small one . project manager: Yeah . That's no problem . user interface: Just uh you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . It uh it's a bit uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . Yeah . It's uh it's more the moulds in which they are being made , I think . Single curved is really easy to just fill in . marketing: Mm . project manager: And cases come right out of the machine . user interface: {gap} . project manager: And single curved you have to have a different uh different machine , than a flat one . I think this is a really easy one . Um , what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? Freek , what do you think ? marketing: Well , I still think we should go for the single curve design . user interface: {gap} . industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: But then again , {gap} all these changes are not really okay with me . industrial designer: Richard's argument was very good . Yeah . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yep . marketing: But since we just have to . project manager: {vocalsound} We have to cut costs . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . Yeah I'm ag marketing: I'd rather just go to the board and get us to spend {vocalsound} eighteen dollars a a remote . project manager: Ask for more money . Yeah . Yeah . I am agreeing with the usability . Yeah . marketing: Or do some market research and see what the options are . project manager: Yeah . But th um I think we can then keep the single curved one . Just to express our L_C_D_ screen a bit more . industrial designer: Yep . marketing: Yeah . project manager: So people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , user interface: Yeah . project manager: it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . It will be necessary to have good help function , as well . So this is scroll . I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . {vocalsound} Before we went on to the to the whole design . marketing: Yes . Definitely . {vocalsound} user interface: The th project manager: But {disfmarker} I'm glad we could make a bit . marketing: Yeah . project manager: It's pretty different , if you saw the last one than {vocalsound} this one . marketing: {vocalsound} It's pretty different . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: But this is not really like for the group we were making our remote . user interface: No . marketing: This will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell . project manager: Yeah . It will . Yeah . user interface: {vocalsound} But um {disfmarker} marketing: 'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff . This is not familiar for them . project manager: No , but I think {disfmarker} marketing: So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them . project manager: I think the most {disfmarker} user interface: But they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios . Uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels . project manager: That's right . marketing: Yeah . project manager: We can let l user interface: So maybe it's uh {disfmarker} project manager: We can stick it out , a bit . Like a old old buttons . {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . Yeah . project manager: Maybe that's recognisable for them as well . Yeah . That's a good one . user interface: Yeah . project manager: So , I'm afraid we have to move on . And it's uh it's b uh less frightening , I think . If they see this design they think oh , there are only five buttons , and uh {disfmarker} But we will see . user interface: Yeah . marketing: That's true . Might uh {disfmarker} might be confusing too . project manager: Yeah . That's definitely right . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: They'd be like , what ? Only five buttons ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: But very special , so uh {disfmarker} project manager: I would buy it . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . But you're not sixty . {vocalsound} project manager: That's right . I would buy it if I was six . {vocalsound} No I don't know . What it costs under twelve and a half Euros ? No ? Uh , yes they are . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: No . {vocalsound} project manager: No . But we can go on with the project evaluation . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: Let's see . I can sit down I think . We still have fifteen minutes left , so we're nice on schedule . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Um , the project process . marketing: So um , I like set up all these criteria . And evaluation of the thingy . {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} Evaluation criteria . That's right . That was the the point I forgot . I should {disfmarker} industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: There we are . Evaluation criteria . {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Thank you . {vocalsound} project manager: Go ahead . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: We've got five minutes I think for those criteria . marketing: Five more minutes ? project manager: No we've got fifteen minutes but {disfmarker} marketing: Okay . project manager: Uh yes . What ? marketing: 'Kay so I did some literature study study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier . project manager: Uh yeah . marketing: Translated it into criteria , which would be these . Um , is the remote fancy ? The shape , look and feel . Innovative ? What new functions are there ? Uh , easy to use ? Uh , learnability is a very important factor here . Uh , is it functional ? Are there not too many functions uh among the functions ? And are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? And the cost . The target group . Is the remote really for the group we're making it for ? And recognability . If our company is {disfmarker} If it is easily recognisable that our company made it ? And {disfmarker} So we're supposed to evaluate it right now . project manager: Okay . marketing: Let's see . Oh I have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting were not here . project manager: Yeah , that's because my pen failed to upload his data . user interface: Mm . Yeah ? {vocalsound} marketing: Okay . project manager: {vocalsound} I tried to marketing: Interesting . project manager: but it's uh it's giving errors by downloading the software . marketing: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: Mm . 'Kay . marketing: Is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ? project manager: I think it's fancy . industrial designer: Six . project manager: Yeah . Six . user interface: Uh six . Yeah . marketing: We all go for six ? Good . Um , is the design innovative ? project manager: Very . {vocalsound} user interface: Mm . Sh marketing: I think so , with our L_C_D_ screen , docking station , scroll-buttons . project manager: Subtitles , buttons . Yeah . Seven . user interface: {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Seven ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: So we've got twenty cents for our docking station , huh ? {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Should be do-able . project manager: Yeah . That's right . marketing: Is the design easy to use ? user interface: Mm . Not really . project manager: That's a bit dodgy . marketing: Well {disfmarker} Would be for us . But {disfmarker} user interface: For old people I I {disfmarker} project manager: I would say four . Four or five between . Between four or five . user interface: W industrial designer: Four or five . Yes . user interface: Yeah . Four . marketing: I'd go for four , too . project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Is it functional ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Is the design functional ? Um , do we have all functions that we want to include ? project manager: Yes . user interface: N Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: I think we do . Do we have too many functions ? project manager: No . user interface: No . industrial designer: No . marketing: I don't think so . It's pretty slim . project manager: Think it's uh seven . marketing: Seven . Oh , and do we um take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? Like it getting lost and {disfmarker} R_S_I_ influences ? user interface: Mm m industrial designer: Mm , we haven't thought of that one . project manager: It was . marketing: Think we do . project manager: I had them worked out . Mm . They are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Are the production costs within the preset limits ? industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Well they are now . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: Does the design fit the group of focus ? user interface: Mm , th yeah . industrial designer: I think that's a three . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . project manager: No I think with our new radio button , I think it's uh I think it's better . marketing: I think it doesn't . user interface: Yeah . Uh {disfmarker} We have to test it s But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} marketing: I don't know . industrial designer: {vocalsound} I still {disfmarker} I think it's too m too fancy . Too too flashy . marketing: I think {disfmarker} project manager: I think it {disfmarker} marketing: I think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control . user interface: Uh , yeah , true . project manager: Yeah . I would give it a four . marketing: I'm not sure . I think I'd go for two . user interface: I go for three . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} project manager: Then we have to do the three . It's the {disfmarker} marketing: 'Kay . Is the company company recognisable ? project manager: Yes it is . user interface: Yeah yeah . marketing: Well , we have the logo there . project manager: Yeah . marketing: So {disfmarker} project manager: And they wanna put fashion in their products . Uh in the slogan of the company . And we have the removable front cases . So , I think it's very recognisable . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yep . marketing: So that will be this . I was also supposed to calculate the score , but thought we would have another private thingy after this . project manager: We've got a calculate it . Mm ? industrial designer: Twendag sieven an twendag . marketing: Is this {disfmarker} Like after this , are we done ? Or {disfmarker} project manager: N We've gonna {disfmarker} We're going to evaluate it . marketing: We're gonna go to our other room again . Well , anyhow . These are seven factors times seven is forty something . Two ? No . project manager: {gap} Forty nine . marketing: Nine ? Uh , minus one . Minus three , minus four . {vocalsound} Minus four . So that would be minus eight . Forty one out of forty nine . project manager: Forty one . That's {disfmarker} Around eighty percent . marketing: Okay . project manager: What is it ? marketing: Guess I'll just type that in on the bottom here . project manager: That's eighty four percent . I think that's a pretty nice score . user interface: Hmm . Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} Okay . marketing: Hmm . 'Kay . So that will be the evaluation . project manager: Thank you . So , that brings us to the project evaluation . Yep . Thank you . marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Project process . Did we move through the right phases , you think ? {vocalsound} Along the process ? industrial designer: Yes . user interface: Yeah . But it {disfmarker} marketing: Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier . In the design phase . user interface: Yeah . project manager: That's right . So lack of information about prices . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . That's true . marketing: Yeah . Definitely . project manager: Okay . Uh {disfmarker} Okay . Satisfaction . Was there room for creativity ? marketing: No . project manager: {vocalsound} No ? {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: Not too much . {vocalsound} No . {vocalsound} project manager: It's because of the finance sheet . Yeah . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , there w there was enough room , but the finance uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah , true . But {disfmarker} project manager: The room was {disfmarker} Yeah . user interface: Yeah . marketing: And I would've liked to go for the younger users also . user interface: {gap} . marketing: And just to be able to access internet and get something of your own . user interface: Mm . project manager: Restrictions . Internet access . 'Kay . Leadership . Was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions ? Yeah ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Teamwork ? Did it work out ? Working together ? Also , you {disfmarker} two of you with the uh last phase ? user interface: So {disfmarker} industrial designer: Yes , was okay . user interface: Yeah . project manager: Nice . industrial designer: The tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it's very easy . user interface: Mm-hmm . marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: {gap} tasks . Okay . Were the means sufficient for the tasks uh we had to do ? Or were they too much ? user interface: Mm . industrial designer: Well , the smart-board , the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass , but {disfmarker} The digital the digital pen is very nice . user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Smart-board . user interface: Yeah . project manager: If it wants to download its uh data . {vocalsound} user interface: But {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} industrial designer: Yes . Yeah . user interface: Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Failed download . Smart-board was irritating . {vocalsound} So you rather wanted to have a flip-over ? Or something else ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: A flip-over or a more precise uh digit user interface: A flipper's uh easier , so {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: Faster as well , I think . marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Yeah . Flip-over . user interface: But if you want to share uh of uh when you make um a picture like this uh on the presentation , it's easier to uh share it with uh other people . Uh so uh project manager: Yeah . user interface: you can sh save it uh and uh put it on the internet , or uh uh in shared f uh folder or uh sh uh shared directory . marketing: Yeah , user interface: So {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} marketing: I tried to open the file on my laptop , user interface: Yeah ? No ? industrial designer: No . Didn't work . marketing: but {vocalsound} not possible . project manager: Uh you need a smart board uh application I think . marketing: Yeah . project manager: But I think you can {disfmarker} user interface: T can uh can you export it uh like a {disfmarker} Yeah . project manager: Yeah . Should be possible . Yeah you can export it as image . marketing: {gap} no . project manager: Must {disfmarker} Yeah must be {disfmarker} marketing: Should've done that then . project manager: So the sharing of the information was uh was okay ? user interface: {gap} . marketing: Pen is here . project manager: Uh , network . user interface: Uh {gap} . industrial designer: Yes . project manager: Yeah , pen is here on the table . marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: Uh , yeah . So you can {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . {gap} It's possible . user interface: It's possible . marketing: Mm . Yeah . project manager: Okay . user interface: Okay . project manager: That's nice . Have we found new ideas for having this kind of meetings ? Or {disfmarker} user interface: Um , yeah maybe um uh when we n uh just uh give the numbers of of uh {disfmarker} Uh uh o one of uh out of s uh sev {gap} project manager: Yeah . user interface: Um it's uh easier to uh to do the th things that are like that on a computer . Uh , so uh just l uh like uh at u university uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah . So {disfmarker} Yeah . So everybody puts his own score . user interface: So {disfmarker} marketing: Mm-hmm . project manager: And then {vocalsound} it mediates the score , user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: and you can get one {disfmarker} user interface: Yeah . project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: That's better . So that's uh {disfmarker} How do we call ? Evaluation criteria . Okay . Mm , any more ideas ? Or questions about the project ? Or about the product ? user interface: Mm . project manager: Because I think then that we get to our last sheet . Are the costs within the budget ? user interface: Mm yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: Yeah . marketing: They are . industrial designer: {vocalsound} Considering we are not going to make a docking station . project manager: Do we {disfmarker} Docking station . That's a good point . user interface: {gap} . project manager: But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: Uh and I think you can compensate that as well . industrial designer: Perhaps . user interface: Mm . project manager: So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem , because it's very cheap to make as well . industrial designer: Mm-hmm . project manager: Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: Or what was it ? {vocalsound} marketing: Fifty grand . project manager: Fifteen fifteen million . I think we will . {vocalsound} If we gonna export this product . It's innovative . marketing: Yeah . project manager: Especially in America . People are pretty decadent . Sometimes . user interface: Yeah . Mm . industrial designer: {vocalsound} user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , still I think {disfmarker} I mean if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people . project manager: You can do more . Yeah . user interface: Ah . marketing: So maybe we should just re-focus . project manager: Just put it on the market for everybody . You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers . user interface: Ah . marketing: Or specifically for younger people . project manager: That's one thing you can change it with . user interface: Ah . marketing: That's true . project manager: So you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market . Just as a test . See how it works . That's I think a good advantage . marketing: Yeah , I think then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is , than would be with older people . Even if it were their covers . project manager: Yeah . Uh , uh then I think we can have our little celebration , right now . user interface: Hmm . marketing: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} user interface: {gap} {vocalsound} project manager: That's it . {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} Party party . project manager: Yeah . I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire . I think . user interface: Where's the champagne ? marketing: 'Kay . project manager: I don't know . I didn't get a message from the from ending of the {disfmarker} user interface: Uh , I believe y uh {disfmarker} project manager: Oh I think I have one now . marketing: Oh you did . project manager: Five more minutes ? Oh that's nice . user interface: Okay . project manager: Then we still have some questions . If somebody has some questions they can ask them now . Or we can put these in the project folder as well . Maybe that's {disfmarker} marketing: Mm-hmm . user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: {vocalsound} project manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Export as picture , I think . user interface: Yeah . marketing: Yeah . project manager: {vocalsound} industrial designer: {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} project manager: Hmm . This is another network , I guess . Does somebody see the project folder ? {vocalsound} marketing: {vocalsound} user interface: {vocalsound} project manager: I don't . Hmm . My Documents . user interface: Uh maybe uh they will save it . So uh {disfmarker} project manager: Yeah , I'll just put it in My Documents marketing: Yeah , it probably will . project manager: and uh {disfmarker} That's okay . Okay . {vocalsound} I think I'm going to make our final presentation now . marketing: Oh yeah , you're supposed to make a final {disfmarker} project manager: {vocalsound} And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation . Summary of the project . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Okay . marketing: Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ? user interface: Uh maybe we have to fill uh another questionnaire . project manager: Yeah . Questionnaire . I think you all get a questionnaire in in your room . user interface: So uh {disfmarker} marketing: Yeah . user interface: Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound} project manager: And then I'll meet you in I think about ten minutes , or something . user interface: Okay . industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Hopefully my pen will download its software . Oh . Or data . marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . That'd be nice .
