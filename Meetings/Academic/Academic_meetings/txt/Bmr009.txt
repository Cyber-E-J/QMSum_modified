professor c: Starts {disfmarker} No . No . phd d: No . That 's a different thing . professor c: There 's another {disfmarker} I don't know . It starts with a P or something . I forget the word for it , but it 's {disfmarker} it 's um phd d: Oh . professor c: Typically when you {disfmarker} you 're ab r starting around forty for most people , it starts to harden and then it 's just harder for the lens to shift things phd d: Oh . professor c: and th the {disfmarker} the symptom is typically that you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you have to hold stuff uh uh further away to {disfmarker} to see it . phd e: Uh - huh . Yeah . professor c: In fact , uh m my brother 's a {pause} gerontological psychologist and he {disfmarker} he uh {vocalsound} came up with an {disfmarker} an uh {disfmarker} a uh body age test which uh gets down to sort of only three measurements that are good enough st statistical predictors of all the rest of it . And one of them is {disfmarker} is the distance {vocalsound} that you have to hold it at . phd d: Give someone a piece of paper and then they {disfmarker} Oh . phd e: Yeah . professor c: Yeah . grad a: We 're {disfmarker} we 're live by the way , so we 've got a good intro here professor c: Oh . Yeah . About how old I am . grad a: Yep . professor c: OK . grad a: We can edit that out if you want . phd d: Oh , that 's optional . professor c: No , that 's OK . grad a: OK . So . This time the form discussion should be very short , phd d: You know . phd e: Mm - hmm . grad a: right ? professor c: It also should be {pause} later . grad a: OK . professor c: Because Jane uh is not here yet . grad a: Good point . professor c: And uh she 'll be most interested in that . Uh , she 's probably least involved in the signal - processing stuff so maybe we can just {disfmarker} just uh , I don't think we should go though an elaborate thing , but um uh Jose and I were just talking about {vocalsound} the uh {nonvocalsound} uh , speech e energy thing , phd e: The @ @ {disfmarker} professor c: and I uh {disfmarker} phd e: Yeah . professor c: We didn't talk about the derivatives . But I think , you know , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} i if I can {disfmarker} if you don't mind my {disfmarker} my speaking for you for a bit , um {vocalsound} Uh . Right now , that he 's not really showing any kind of uh distinction , but uh {disfmarker} but we discussed a couple of the possible things that uh he can look at . Um . And uh one is that uh this is all in log energy and log energy is basically compressing the distances {vocalsound} uh {pause} between things . Um {pause} Another is that he needs to play with the {disfmarker} the different uh {pause} uh temporal sizes . He was {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he was taking everything over two hundred milliseconds uh , and uh he 's going to vary that number and also look at moving windows , as we discussed before . Um And uh {disfmarker} and the other thing is that the {disfmarker} yeah doing the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} subtracting off the mean and the variance in the {disfmarker} {pause} uh and dividing it by the {pause} standard deviation in the log domain , {vocalsound} may not be {pause} the right thing to do . grad a: Hi Jane ! phd e: Hi . grad a: We just started . phd e: Yeah . grad a: Could you take that mike there ? phd d: Are these the long term means ? Like , over the whole {disfmarker} I mean , the means of {pause} what ? grad a: Thanks . professor c: Uh B Between {disfmarker} between {disfmarker} phd d: All the frames in the conversation ? professor c: No . phd d: Or of things that {disfmarker} professor c: Between {disfmarker} Neither . It 's uh between the pauses {pause} uh for some segment . phd e: No . phd d: Oh . professor c: And so i i his {disfmarker} his {disfmarker} He 's making the constraint it has to be at least two hundred milliseconds . phd d: Oh . professor c: And so you take that . And then he 's {disfmarker} he 's uh measuring at the frame level {disfmarker} still at the frame level , of what {disfmarker} phd d: Right . professor c: and then {disfmarker} and then just uh normalizing with that larger amount . um and {disfmarker} But one thing he was pointing out is when he {disfmarker} he looked at a bunch of examples in log domain , it is actually pretty hard to see {vocalsound} the change . And you can sort of {pause} see that , because of j of just putting it on the board that {vocalsound} if you sort of have log - X plus log - X , that 's the log of X plus the log of two phd e: Yep . phd d: Yeah , maybe it 's not log distributed . phd e: Mmm . Yeah . professor c: and it 's just , {pause} you know , it {disfmarker} it diminishes the {pause} effect of having two of them . phd e:  professor c: Um . phd d: But you could do like a C D F there instead ? I mean , we don't know that the distribution here is normally . professor c: Yes , right . So {disfmarker} So what I was suggesting to him is that {disfmarker} phd d: So just some kind of a simple {disfmarker} professor c: Actually , a PDF . But , you know , uh But , either way . phd d: PDF professor c: Yeah . Yeah , eith eith uh {vocalsound} B phd d: Yeah . phd e: Yeah . phd d: Something like that where it 's sort of data driven . professor c: Yeah , but I think {pause} also u I think a good first indicator is when the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the researcher looks at {vocalsound} examples of the data and can not see a change {pause} in how big the {disfmarker} the signal is , {vocalsound} when the two speaker {disfmarker} phd e: Yeah . Yeah . professor c: Then , that 's a problem right there . So . I think you should at least be able , phd d: Oh yeah . professor c: doing casual looking and can get the sense , " Hey , there 's something there . " and then you can play around with the measures . And when he 's looking in the log domain he 's not really seeing it . phd d: Oh yeah . phd e: Yeah . professor c: So . And when he 's looking in straight energy he is , so that 's a good place to start . phd e: Yeah . professor c: Um . So that was {disfmarker} that was the discussion we just had . Um . {vocalsound} The other thing Actually we ca had a question for Adam in this . Uh , when you did the {vocalsound} sampling ? uh {pause} over the {pause} speech segments or s or sampling over the {disfmarker} the individual channels in order to do the e uh the {pause} amplitude equalization , {vocalsound} did you do it over just the entire {disfmarker} everything in the mike channels ? phd e: How {disfmarker} professor c: You didn't try to find speech ? grad a: No , I just took over the entire s uh entire channel um {pause} sampled ten minutes randomly . professor c: Right , OK . So then that means that someone who didn't speak {pause} very much {vocalsound} would be largely represented by silence . grad a: Yep . professor c: And someone who would {disfmarker} who would be {disfmarker} So the normalization factor probably is {pause} i i i {pause} is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} grad a: Yeah , this was quite quick and dirty , and it was just for {pause} listening . phd e: Yeah . professor c: Yeah . grad a: And for listening it seems to work really well . professor c: OK . phd e: Yeah . professor c: Yeah . phd e: Yeah . grad a: So . professor c: Yeah . But that 's {disfmarker} grad a: But , it 's not {disfmarker} Not a good measure . professor c: Right . So th phd e: Yeah . professor c: OK . So yeah there {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} There 's a good chance then given that different people do talk different amounts {pause} that there is {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there is still a lot more to be gained from gain norm normalization with some sort phd e: Yeah . Yeah . Mmm . grad a: Yes , absolutely . professor c: if {disfmarker} if we can figure out a way to do it . phd e: Yeah . professor c: Uh . But we were agreed that in addition to that {comment} uh there should be {pause} s stuff related to pitch and harmonics and so forth . phd e: Yeah . professor c: So we didn't talk at all about uh the other derivatives , but uh again just {disfmarker} just looking at {disfmarker} Uh , I think uh Liz has a very good point , that in fact it would be much more graphic just to show {disfmarker} Well , actually , you do have some distributions here , uh for these cases . phd e: Yeah . Yeah . professor c: You have some histograms , um {pause} and {pause} uh , they don't look very separate . phd e: Yeah . professor c: uh {vocalsound} {pause} separated . phd e: This is the {disfmarker} the first derivate of log of frame energy uh without any kind of normalization . phd d: What {disfmarker} professor c: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . phd d: Log energy . Sorry . phd e: These the These are the {disfmarker} the first experiments uh with comment uh phd d: Frame energy . grad a: Except that {pause} it 's hard to judge this because the {disfmarker} they 're not normalized . It 's just number of frames . phd d: Yeah . professor c: Yeah . phd d: Yeah . phd e: Yeah . grad a: But yeah , even so . phd d: W {vocalsound} I mean , what I meant is , even if you use linear , {pause} you know , raw {pause} measures , like {pause} raw energy or whatever , professor c: " Number " {disfmarker} phd d: maybe we shouldn't make any assumptions about the distribution 's shape , and just use {disfmarker} you know , use the distribution to model the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {pause} the mean , or what y you know , rather than the mean take some {disfmarker} professor c: Yeah . But {disfmarker} And so in {disfmarker} in these he 's got that . phd d: Yeah . professor c: He 's got some pictures . But he doesn't {disfmarker} he doesn't in the {disfmarker} he i phd e: Yeah . professor c: just in derivatives , but not in the {disfmarker} phd d: Yeah . Oh . professor c: but he d but he doesn't {disfmarker} doesn't {disfmarker} phd d: Right . So , we don't {pause} know what they look like {pause} on the , {pause} tsk {disfmarker} {comment} For the raw . professor c: But he didn't h have it for the energy . He had it for the derivatives . Yeah . phd d: Yeah . So . I mean , there might be something there . I don't know . professor c: Yeah . phd d: Huh . grad a: Interesting phd e: Here I {disfmarker} I professor c: Oh that {disfmarker} yeah that 's a good q phd e: in {disfmarker} No I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I haven't the result professor c: did {disfmarker} did you have this sort of thing , for just the {disfmarker} just the l r uh the {disfmarker} the unnormalized log energy ? OK . Yeah . So she {disfmarker} she 's right . phd e: but it 's the {disfmarker} it 's the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the following . professor c: That 's a {disfmarker} phd d: Well it might be just good to know what it looks like . professor c: Yeah . That 's {disfmarker} That 's uh {pause} cuz I 'd mentioned scatter plots before but she 's right , phd d: Cuz {disfmarker} phd e: Huh ? professor c: I mean , even before you get the scatter plots , just looking at a single feature {vocalsound} uh , looking at the distribution , is a good thing to do . phd e: Yeah . Catal - uh {disfmarker} Combining the different possibilities of uh the parameters . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the scatter plot {pause} combining eh different {pause} n two combination . professor c: Yeah , but {disfmarker} but what she 's saying {pause} is , which is right , is {pause} le phd e: combination of two , {pause} of energy and derivate {disfmarker} professor c: I mean , let 's start with the {disfmarker} Before we get complicated , let 's start with the most basic wh thing , which is {pause} we 're arguing that if you take energy {disfmarker} uh if you look at the energy , that , when two people are speaking at the same time , usually {vocalsound} {pause} there 'll be more energy than when one is right ? phd e: Yeah . professor c: That 's {disfmarker} that sort of hypothesis . phd e: That 's right . professor c: And the first way you 'd look at that , uh s she 's , you know , absolutely right , is that you would just take a look at the distribution of those two things , much as you 've plotted them here , phd e: Yeah . professor c: You know , but just {disfmarker} but just {disfmarker} {pause} just uh do it {disfmarker} phd e: Yeah . professor c: Well in this case you have three . You have the silence , and that {disfmarker} that 's fine . phd e: Yeah . professor c: So , uh with three colors or three shades or whatever , just {disfmarker} just look at those distributions . phd e: Yeah . professor c: And then , given that as a base , you can see if that gets improved , you know , or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} {pause} or worsened {pause} by the {disfmarker} looking at regular energy , looking at log energy , we were just proposing that maybe it 's {disfmarker} you know , it 's harder to {pause} see with the log energy , um and uh also these different normalizations , does a particular choice of normalization make it better ? phd e: Yeah . professor c: But I had maybe made it too complicated by suggesting early on , that you look at scatter plots because that 's looking at a distribution in two dimensions . Let 's start off just in one , uh , with this feature . phd e: Yeah . Yeah . professor c: I think that 's probably the most basic thing , before anything very complicated . phd e: Yeah . professor c: Um And then we w I think we 're agreed that pitch - related things are {disfmarker} are {disfmarker} are going to be a {disfmarker} a really likely candidate to help . phd d: Yeah . phd e: Yeah . I agree , yeah . Uh - huh . professor c: Um {pause} But {pause} since {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh your intuition from looking at some of the data , is that when you looked at the regular energy , that it did in fact usually go up , {vocalsound} when two people were talking , {vocalsound} that 's {disfmarker} eh you know , you should be able to come up with a measure which will {pause} match your intuition . phd e: OK . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . professor c: And she 's right , that a {disfmarker} that having a {disfmarker} having {disfmarker} {comment} having this table , with a whole bunch of things , {pause} with the standard deviation , the variance and so forth , it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's harder to interpret than just looking at the {disfmarker} the same kind of picture you have here . phd e: But {disfmarker} Uh - huh . Yeah . But {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it 's curious but uh I f I found it in the {disfmarker} in the mixed file , in one channel {vocalsound} that eh in several {disfmarker} oh e eh several times eh you have an speaker talking alone with a high level of energy professor c: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . phd e: eh in the middle eh a zone of overlapping with mmm less energy professor c: Mm - hmm . phd e: and eh come with another speaker with high energy professor c: Mm - hmm . phd e: and the overlapping zone has eh less energy . professor c: Yeah . So there 'll be some cases for which {disfmarker} phd e: Because there reach very many professor c: But , the qu So {disfmarker} So they 'll be {disfmarker} phd d: Right . professor c: This is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I w want to point {pause} to visual things , But I mean they {disfmarker} there 'll be time {disfmarker} There 'll be overlap between the distributions , but the question is , " If it 's a reasonable feature at all , there 's some separation . " phd e: Yeah . Yeah . phd d: Especially locally . professor c: Mm - hmm . phd d: So . Locally . phd e: just locally , yeah . grad a: And {disfmarker} I was just going to say that {disfmarker} that {pause} right now we 're just exploring . phd d: And the other thing is I Sorry . I {disfmarker} grad a: What you would imagine eventually , is that you 'll feed all of these features into some {pause} discriminative system . phd e: Yeah . professor c: Yeah . grad a: And so even if {disfmarker} if one of the features does a good job at one type of overlap , another feature might do a good job at another type of overlap . phd e: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . professor c: Right . I mean the {disfmarker} the reason I had suggested the scatter f p features is I used to do this a lot , when we had thirteen or fifteen or twenty features {pause} to look at . phd e: Yeah , this is the {disfmarker} professor c: um Because something is a good feature uh by itself , you don't really know how it 'll behave in combination and so it 's nice to have as many {disfmarker} as many together at the same time as possible in uh in some reasonable visual form . There 's cool graphic things people have had sometimes to put together three or four in some funny {disfmarker} funny way . But it 's true that you shouldn't do any of that unless you know that the individual ones , at least , have {disfmarker} have some uh {disfmarker} some hope phd e: Yeah . phd d: Well , especially for normalizing . professor c: Mm - hmm . phd d: I mean , it 's really important to {pause} pick a normalization that matches the distribution for that feature . professor c: Mm - hmm . phd d: And it may not be the same for all the types of overlaps or the windows may not be the same . e Actually , I was wondering , {vocalsound} right now you 're taking a {disfmarker} all of the {pause} speech , from the whole meeting , and you 're trying to find points of overlap , but we don't really know which speaker is overlapping with which speaker , professor c: Right . phd d: right ? So I mean another way would just be to take the speech from just , say , Morgan , And just Jane and then just their overlaps , phd e: Yeah . phd d: like {disfmarker} but by hand , by cheating , and looking at you know , if you can detect something that way , because if we can't do it that way , there 's no good way that we 're going to be able to do it . grad a: No prayer . phd d: That {disfmarker} You know , there might be something helpful and cleaner about looking at just {pause} individuals and then that combination alone . phd e: Yeah . phd d: Plus , I think it has more elegant {disfmarker} e professor c: Mm - hmm . phd d: The m the right model will be {pause} easier to see that way . So if {disfmarker} I don't know , if you go through and you find Adam , cuz he has a lot of overlaps and some other speaker who also has e enough speech phd e: Yeah . phd d: and just sort of look at those three cases of Adam and the other person and the overlaps , phd e: Yeah . phd d: maybe {disfmarker} and just look at the distributions , maybe there is a clear pattern phd e: Yeah . phd d: but we just can't see it because there 's too many combinations of {disfmarker} of people that can overlap . phd e: Uh - huh . Yeah . postdoc b: I had the same intuition last {disfmarker} last {disfmarker} last week . phd d: So . Just seems sort of complex . phd e: Yeah . postdoc b: I think it 's {disfmarker} to start with it 's s your {disfmarker} your idea of simplifying , starting with something that {pause} you can see {pause} eh you know without the {pause} extra {pause} layers of {disfmarker} phd d: Right . Cuz if energy doesn't matter there , like {disfmarker} I don't think this is true , but what if phd e: To study individual ? postdoc b: Sorry , what ? phd d: Hmm ? phd e: To study individual ? postdoc b: Well , you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you don't have to study everybody individually phd d: Well , to study the simplest case to get rid of extra {disfmarker} phd e: The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} Consider {disfmarker} postdoc b: but {pause} just simple case and the one that has the lot of data associated with it . phd d: Right . Cuz what if it 's the case and I don't think this is true {disfmarker} grad a: That was a great overlap by the way . phd d: What if it 's the case that when two people overlap they equate their {disfmarker} you know , there 's a {pause} conservation of energy and everybody {disfmarker} both people talk more softly ? I don't think this happens at all . postdoc b: Or {disfmarker} or what if what if the equipment {disfmarker} what if the equipment adjusts somehow , phd d: Or they get louder . postdoc b: there 's some equalizing in there ? phd d: Yeah or {disfmarker} professor c: Uh , no we don't have that . phd d: I mean . grad a: Well , but {disfmarker} But I think that 's what I was saying about different types of overlap . postdoc b: OK . professor c: But . postdoc b: Saturation . phd d: There are {disfmarker} there are different types , and within those types , like as Jose was saying , that {pause} sounded like a backchannel overlap , meaning the kind that 's {pause} a friendly encouragement , like " Mm - hmm . " , " Great ! " , " Yeah ! " phd e: Yeah . phd d: And it doesn't take {disfmarker} you don't take the floor . Um , but , some of those , as you showed , I think can be discriminated by the duration of the overlap . phd e: Yeah . phd d: So . It {disfmarker} Actually the s new student , Don , who um Adam has met , and he was at one of our meetings {disfmarker} He 's {pause} getting his feet wet and then he 'll be starting again {pause} in mid - January . He 's interested in trying to distinguish the types of overlap . I don't know if he 's talked with you yet . But in sort of honing in on these different types phd e: Yeah . I don't consi Now I don't consider that possibility . phd d: and {disfmarker} So maybe {disfmarker} phd e: This is a s a general studio of the overlapping we 're studying the {disfmarker} i professor c: Yeah . Well {pause} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would s actually still recommend that he do the overall thing phd d: So it might be something that we can {pause} help by categorizing some of them and then , you know , look at that . professor c: because {pause} it would be the quickest thing for him to do . He could {disfmarker} You see , he already has all his stuff in place , phd d: Yeah . professor c: he has the histogram mechanism , he has the stuff that subtracts out {disfmarker} and all he has to do is change it uh uh from {disfmarker} from log to plain energy and plot the histogram and look at it . And then he should go on and do the other stuff bec but {disfmarker} But this will {disfmarker} phd d: Yeah . Yeah , no . I didn't mean that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} for you to do that , but I was thinking if {disfmarker} if Don and I are trying to get {pause} categories professor c: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . phd d: and we label some data for you , and we say this is what we think is going {disfmarker} So you don't have to worry about it . And here 's the three types of overlaps . phd e: Yeah . phd d: And we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll do the labelling for you . phd e: Yeah . professor c: Hm - hmm . phd d: Um . phd e: Consider different class of overlap ? phd d: Yeah , that we would be working on anyway . phd e: If there 's time . phd d: Then maybe {pause} you can try some different things for those three cases , and see if that helps , or {disfmarker} phd e: Yeah . Yeah . This is the thing I {disfmarker} I comment with you before , that uh we have a great variation of th situation of overlapping . professor c: Mm - hmm . phd e: And the behavior for energy is , uh log energy , {vocalsound} is not uh the same all the time . phd d: Mm - hmm . phd e: And {disfmarker} professor c: But I guess I was just saying that {disfmarker} that right now uh from the means that you gave , I don't have any sense of whether even , you know , there are any significant number of cases for which there is distinct {disfmarker} and I would imagine there should be some {disfmarker} you know , there should be {disfmarker} The distributions should be somewhat separated . phd e: Yeah . Yeah . professor c: Uh and I {disfmarker} I would still guess that if they are not separated at all , that there 's some {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's most likely something wrong in the way that we 're measuring it . phd e: Yeah . Yeah . professor c: Um , but {pause} um For instance , I mean I wouldn't expect that it was very common overall , that when two people were talking at the same time , that it would {disfmarker} that it really was lower , phd e: Yeah . professor c: although sometimes , as you say , it would . phd e: Yeah . professor c: So . So . phd d: Yeah , no , that was {disfmarker} That was a jok phd e: Yeah . professor c: Yeah . phd d: or a sort of , a case where {disfmarker} where you would never know that unless you actually go and look at two individuals . professor c: I mean . No . It could {disfmarker} it probably does happen sometimes . phd e: Yeah . grad a: Right . professor c: Yeah . Yeah . grad a: Mind if I turned that light off ? phd e: Yeah . phd d: So . grad a: The flickering is annoying me . professor c: OK . phd d: It might the case , though , that the significant energy , just as Jose was saying , comes in the non - backchannel cases . Because in back Most people when they 're talking don't change their own {pause} energy when they get a backchannel , cuz they 're not really predicting the backchannel . professor c: Mm - hmm . phd d: And sometimes it 's a nod and sometimes it 's an " mm - hmm " . phd e: Yeah . phd d: And the " mm - hmm " is really usually very low energy . phd e: Yeah . phd d: So maybe those don't actually have much difference in energy . But {pause} all the other cases might . professor c: e {vocalsound} e and {disfmarker} and again what they {disfmarker} what difference there was would kind of be lost in taking the log , phd d: and the backchannels are sort of easy to spot s in terms of their words or {disfmarker} I mean , just listen to it . phd e: Yeah . phd d: So . professor c: so , as well . phd d: Well , it would be lost {pause} no matter what you do . phd e: But {disfmarker} Yeah . phd d: It just {disfmarker} professor c: Mmm , no , if it 's {disfmarker} if i if it 's {disfmarker} grad a: Tone professor c: Well , it won't be as big . phd d: I mean , even if you take the log , you can {disfmarker} your model just has a more sensitive {pause} measures . phd e: Yeah . grad a: Sure , but tone might be very phd d: So . grad a: Yeah , you 're " mm - hmm " tone is going to be very different . phd d: Yeah . Right . Right . grad a: You could imagine doing specialized ones for different types of backchannels , if you could {disfmarker} if you had a good model for it . Your " mm - hmm " detector . professor c: If {disfmarker} if you 're {disfmarker} a I guess my point is , if you 're doing essentially a linear separation , taking the log first does in fact make it harder to separate . grad a: Right . professor c: So it 's {disfmarker} So , uh if you i i So i if there {disfmarker} if there close to things it does phd e: Yeah . phd d: Yeah . professor c: it 's a nonlinear operation that does in fact change the distinction . If you 're doing a non if you 're doing some fancy thing then {disfmarker} then yeah . And right now we 're essentially doing this linear thing by looking across here and {disfmarker} and saying we 're going to cut it here . Um and that {disfmarker} that 's the indicator that we 're getting . But anyway , yeah , we 're not {pause} disagreeing on any of this , we should look at it more uh {disfmarker} more finely , but uh uh I think that {disfmarker} This often happens , you do fairly complicated things , and then you stand back from them and you realize that you haven't done something simple . So uh , if you generated something like that just for the energy and see , and then , a a a as {disfmarker} as Liz says , when they g have uh uh smaller um , more coherent groups to look at , that would be another interesting thing later . phd e: Uh - huh . professor c: And then that should give us some indication {disfmarker} between those , should give us some indication of whether there 's anything to be achieved f from energy at all . phd e: Uh - huh . professor c: And then you can move on to the uh {pause} uh more {nonvocalsound} pitch related stuff . phd e: Mm - hmm . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think this is a good idea . professor c: OK . postdoc b: Mm - hmm . phd e: Not consider the log energy . professor c: Yeah . But then the {disfmarker} Have you started looking at the pitch related {pause} stuff at all , or {disfmarker} ? Pitch {pause} related ? phd e: The {disfmarker} ? professor c: Harmonicity and so on ? phd e: I {disfmarker} I 'm preparing the {disfmarker} the program but I don't {disfmarker} I don't begin because eh {vocalsound} I saw your email professor c: Preparing to {disfmarker} Yeah . phd e: and {pause} I agree with you it 's better to {disfmarker} I suppose it 's better to {disfmarker} to consider the {disfmarker} the energy this kind of parameter {vocalsound} bef professor c: Yeah . Oh , that 's not what I meant . No , no . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Well , we certainly should see this but I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think that the harm I certainly wasn't saying this was better than the harmonicity and pitch related things I was just saying phd e: I {disfmarker} I go on with the {disfmarker} with the pitch , professor c: Yeah . phd e: aha ! {pause} OK . professor c: Yeah , I was just saying {disfmarker} phd e: I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I understood uh that eh {pause} I {disfmarker} I had to finish {pause} by the moment with the {vocalsound} and {disfmarker} and concentrate my {disfmarker} my energy in that problem . professor c: OK . OK . {vocalsound} OK . But I think , like , all these derivatives and second derivatives and all these other very fancy things , I think I would just sort of look at the energy {pause} and then get into the harmonicity as {disfmarker} as a suggestion . phd e: OK . I go on with the pitch . professor c: Uh OK . So maybe uh since w we 're trying to uh compress the meeting , um , I know Adam had some form stuff he wanted to talk about and did you have some ? postdoc b: I wanted to ask just s something on the end of this top topic . So , when I presented my results about the uh distribution of overlaps and the speakers and the profiles of the speakers , at the bottom of that I did have a proposal , phd e: Uh - huh . postdoc b: and I had plan to go through with it , of {disfmarker} of co coding the types of overlaps that people were involved in s just with reference to speaker style so , you know , with reference {disfmarker} phd d: Oh . postdoc b: and you know I said that on my {disfmarker} in my summary , phd d: That 'd be great . postdoc b: that {pause} you know so it 's like people may have different amounts of being overlapped with or overlapping phd d: Yeah , I remem Right . postdoc b: but that in itself is not informative without knowing what types of overlaps they 're involved in so I was planning to do a taxonomy of types overlaps with reference to that . phd d: That would be great . postdoc b: So , but it you know it 's like it sounds like you also have uh something in that direction . phd d: That would be really great . phd e: Yeah . grad a: Hmm . postdoc b: Is {disfmarker} is it {disfmarker} phd d: We have nothing {disfmarker} You know , basically , we got {pause} his environment set up . He 's {disfmarker} he 's a double - E {comment} you know . So . It 's mostly that , {pause} if we had to {pause} label it ourselves , we {disfmarker} we would or we 'd have to , to get started , but if {disfmarker} {pause} It {disfmarker} it would be much better if you can do it . You 'd be much better {comment} at doing it also because {vocalsound} you know , I {disfmarker} I 'm not {disfmarker} I don't have a good feel for how they should be sorted out , postdoc b: Interesting . phd d: and I really didn't wanna go into that if I didn't have to . So if {disfmarker} If you 're w willing to do that or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} grad a: It would be interesting , though , to talk , maybe not at the meeting , but at some other time about what are the classes . postdoc b: Well maybe we can OK . phd e: Yeah . postdoc b: Mm - hmm . phd d: Yeah . postdoc b: Mm - hmm . phd d: I think that 's a research {pause} effort in and of itself , phd e: Yeah . grad a: Yeah , it would be interesting . phd d: because you can read the literature , but I don't know how it 'll {pause} turn out phd e: Yeah . phd d: and , You know , it 's always an interesting question . postdoc b: It seems like we also s with reference to a purpose , too , that we we 'd want to have them coded . phd e: I would think it 's interesting , yeah . Yeah . phd d: That 'd be great . grad a: Yep . phd e: Yeah . postdoc b: OK . phd d: That 'd be really great . postdoc b: I can do that . phd d: And we 'd still have some {pause} funding for this project , phd e: uh uh phd d: like probably , if we had to hire some {disfmarker} like an undergrad , because uh Don is being covered half time on something else {disfmarker} postdoc b: Mm - hmm . phd d: I mean , he {disfmarker} we 're not paying him {pause} the full RA - ship for {disfmarker} all the time . So . {vocalsound} um If we got it to where we wanted {disfmarker} we needed someone to do that {disfmarker} I don't think there 's really enough data where {disfmarker} where {disfmarker} postdoc b: Mm - hmm . Yeah , I see this as a prototype , to use the only the {disfmarker} the already transcribed meeting as just a prototype . phd e: Yeah . phd d: Yeah . phd e: I {disfmarker} I think a a another parameter we c we {disfmarker} we can consider is eh the {pause} duration . phd d: But {disfmarker} grad a: Mm - hmm . phd e: Another e e m besides eh the {disfmarker} the class of overlap , the duration . Because is possible {vocalsound} eh some s s um eh some classes eh has eh {pause} a type of a duration , eh , {pause} a duration very short uh when we have {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we have overlapping with speech . postdoc b: Mm - hmm . phd d: Yeah , definitely . postdoc b: Yeah , maybe {disfmarker} It may be correlated . Mm - hmm . phd e: Is possible to have . And it 's interesting , {pause} I think , {pause} to consider the {disfmarker} the window of normalization , normalization window . Eh {pause} because eh if we have a type of , {pause} a kind of eh overlap , eh backchannel overlap , with a short duration , is possible {pause} eh to normali i i that if we normalize eh with eh {pause} eh consider only the {disfmarker} the eh window eh by the left eh ri eh {pause} side on the right side overlapping with a {disfmarker} a very {pause} eh oh a small window eh the {disfmarker} if the fit of normalization is eh mmm bigger eh in that overlapping zone eh very short postdoc b: Mm - hmm . phd d: Yeah , that 's true . The window shouldn't be larger than the backchannel . phd e: I {disfmarker} I me I {disfmarker} I understand . I mean that you have eh you have a backchannel , eh , eh {disfmarker} you have a overlapping zone very short phd d: Yeah . phd e: and you consider eh n eh all the channel to normalize this very short eh {disfmarker} professor c: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . phd e: for example " mmm mm - hmm hmm " eh And the energy is not eh height eh I think if you consider all the channel to normalize and the channel is {pause} mmm bigger {pause} eh eh eh compared with the {disfmarker} with the overlapping eh duration , professor c: Mm - hmm . phd e: eh the effect is mmm stronger eh {pause} that I {disfmarker} I mean the {disfmarker} the e effect of the normalization eh with the mean and the {disfmarker} and the variance eh is different that if you consider {pause} only a {pause} window compared eh with the n the duration of overlapping . professor c: Mm - hmm . You {disfmarker} you want it around the overlapping part . phd e: Not {disfmarker} Yeah . professor c: You want it to include something that 's not in overlapping phd e: Yeah . postdoc b: Mm - hmm . professor c: but {disfmarker} but uh phd e: Yeah . I {disfmarker} I don't know . professor c: Yeah . phd e: Is {disfmarker} s If {disfmarker} phd d: Well it 's a sliding window , right ? So if you take the {disfmarker} the measure in the center of the overlapped {pause} piece , you know , there 'd better be some something . professor c: Mm - hmm . phd e: Yeah . Yeah . phd d: But if your window is really huge then yeah you 're right you won't even {disfmarker} phd e: Yeah , This is the {disfmarker} This is the {disfmarker} the idea , {vocalsound} to consider only the {disfmarker} the small window near {disfmarker} near {disfmarker} near the {disfmarker} the overlapping zone . phd d: The portion of the {disfmarker} {comment} of the backchannel won't {disfmarker} won't effect anything . But you {disfmarker} Yeah . So . You know , you shouldn't be more than like {disfmarker} {pause} You should definitely not be three times as big as your {disfmarker} as your {pause} backchannel . phd e: Yeah . postdoc b: Mm - hmm . phd d: Then you 're gonna w have a wash . And hopefully it 's more like on the order of {disfmarker} professor c: I 'm not sure that 's {pause} necessarily true . phd e: Yeah ? postdoc b: It is an empirical question , it seems like . professor c: Because {disfmarker} because it {disfmarker} because um again if you 're just compensating for the gain , phd d: Yea phd e: Yeah . postdoc b: Yeah . professor c: you know , the fact that this {disfmarker} this gain thing was crude , and the gain wh if someone is speaking relatively at consistent level , just to {disfmarker} to give a {disfmarker} an extreme example , all you 're doing is compensating for that . And then you still s And then if you look at the frame with respect to that , it still should {disfmarker} should uh change phd d: Yeah , it depends how different your normalization is , as you slide your window across . professor c: Mm - hmm . phd d: I mean . That 's something we don't know . postdoc b: It 's possible to try it both ways , grad a: Well , I mean we 're also talking about a couple of different things . postdoc b: isn't it ? in this small grad a: I mean , one is your analysis window and then the other is any sort of normalization that you 're doing . phd d: Yeah I was talking about the n normalization window . grad a: And the {disfmarker} And they could be quite different . professor c: Right . phd d: Yeah . phd e: Yeah . professor c: This was sort of where {disfmarker} where we were last week . grad a: Yep . phd d: Yeah . That 's true . Yeah . professor c: But , anyway We {disfmarker} we 'll have to look at some core things . postdoc b: OK . phd d: Um . But that 'd be great if {disfmarker} if you 're marking those phd e: OK . postdoc b: Great . phd d: and {disfmarker} um . postdoc b: OK . phd d: But it is definitely true that we need to have the time marks , phd e: Yeah . postdoc b: Mm - hmm . phd d: and I was assuming that will be inherited because , if you have the words and they 're roughly aligned in time via forced alignment or whatever we end up using , then you know , this {pause} student and I would be looking at the time marks postdoc b: Yep , I agree . Mm - hmm . Coming off of the other {disfmarker} phd d: and classifying all the frames inside those as whatever labels Jane gave phd e: Yeah . postdoc b: Good . So , it wouldn't be {pause} I wasn't planning to label the time marks . phd d:  phd e: I can give you my transcription file , postdoc b: I was thinking that that would come from the engineering side , phd d: I don't think you need to . phd e: no ? postdoc b: yeah . phd d: Yeah . That should be linked to the words which are linked to time somehow , postdoc b: There you go . grad a: Well we 're not any time soon going to get a forced alignment . phd d: right ? Not now . grad a: So . phd e: Yeah . grad a: Um If it 's not hand - marked then we 're not going to get the times . phd d: Well , it 's something that w Well , we {disfmarker} we wouldn't be able to do any work without a forced alignment anyway , phd e: Yes phd d: so somehow if {disfmarker} once he gets going we 're gonna hafta come up with one professor c: Yes . phd d: and Yeah . grad a: I mean w I guess we could do a very bad one with Broadcast News . postdoc b: Good . Good . phd d: So whatever you would label would be attached to the words , I think . postdoc b: Great ! Good , good . Mm - hmm . phd e: Yeah . professor c: Well again for the close {pause} mike stuff , we could come up {disfmarker} take a s take the Switchboard system or something , grad a: That might be good enough . Yeah . professor c: and {disfmarker} Um grad a: It 'd be worth a try . It would be interesting to see what we get . professor c: Just , you know , low - pass filter the speech and {disfmarker} phd d: Cuz there 's {disfmarker} there 's a lot of work you can't do without that , I mean , how {disfmarker} how would you {disfmarker} professor c: Yeah . phd d: You 'd have to go in and measure every start and stop point next to a word grad a: Yep . postdoc b: It would be very inefficient . phd d: is y if you 're interested in anything to do with words . phd e: Yeah . postdoc b: Mm - hmm . phd d: So . Anyway {pause} So that 'd be great . postdoc b: Good . OK . phd e: Yeah . professor c: There 's something we should talk about later but maybe not just now . But , uh , should talk about our options as far as the uh uh {pause} transcription grad a: Yep , if IBM doesn't {disfmarker} professor c: But . Well , w But we 'll do that later . postdoc b: OK . Good . phd d: Do we hafta {pause} turn {disfmarker} postdoc b: Yeah . Let 's do that later . phd d: Are we supposed to keep recording here ? grad a: Yeah {vocalsound} Right . postdoc b: Yeah . professor c: We 'll talk about it later . postdoc b: Yeah . professor c: So {vocalsound} uh Uh " forms " . grad a: Forms Next iteration of forms . professor c: You had something on forms . grad a: Oops . postdoc b: Oh ! Oh good , OK . professor c: Um . Oh . postdoc b: How {disfmarker} So it 's two pages per person ? grad a: Nope . One 's a digit form , one 's a speaker form . postdoc b: Oh ! grad a: So one is a one time only {pause} speaker form and the other is the digits . postdoc b: Oh , I see . phd e: Oh it 's the same . Oh no no . Is {disfmarker} is new Is OK . grad a: So don't fill these out . postdoc b: Alright . grad a: This is just the suggestion for uh what the new forms would look like . So , they incorporate the changes {pause} that we talked about . postdoc b: Date and time . Uh why did you switch the order of the Date and Time fields ? This is rather a low - level , but grad a: On which one ? postdoc b: On {disfmarker} on the new one , Time comes first and then Date , but I thought {disfmarker} grad a: Oh you mean on the digit form ? postdoc b: This is {disfmarker} this is rather a low level question , but {disfmarker} but it used {disfmarker} used to be Date came first . grad a: Uh , because the user fills out the first three fields and I fill out the rest . postdoc b: Oh I see . grad a: So it was intentional . postdoc b: Well , how would the {disfmarker} How would the user know the time if they didn't know the date ? grad a: It 's an interesting observation , but it was intentional . Because the date is when you actually read the digits and the time and , excuse me , the time is when you actually read the digits , but I 'm filling out the date beforehand . If you look at the form in front of you ? that you 're going to fill out when you read the digits ? you 'll see I 've already filled in the date but not the time . postdoc b: Yeah . I always assumed {disfmarker} So the time is supposed to be pretty exact , because I 've just been taking beginning time {disfmarker} time of the meeting . phd d: Yeah , me too . grad a: Yeah , I 've noticed that in the forms . phd e: Yeah , I {disfmarker} yeah . grad a: The {disfmarker} the reason I put the time in , is so that the person who 's extracting the digits , meaning me , will know where to look in the meeting , to try to find the digits . phd d:  phd e: Me too . Oh ! postdoc b: Oh dear . We 've been {disfmarker} we 've been messing up your forms . phd e: But {disfmarker} I am put {disfmarker} I am putting the beginning of the meeting . grad a: I know . phd d: So you should call it , like , " digits start time " . Or . grad a: And I haven't said anything . Yep . phd e: in {disfmarker} on there . professor c: Why {disfmarker} What {disfmarker} what were you putting in ? postdoc b: Oh , well , I was saying if we started the meeting at two thirty , phd e: Yeah . postdoc b: I 'd put two thirty , and I guess d e everyone was putting two thirty , professor c: Oh . phd e: Yeah . grad a: No , it 's about fifty fifty . postdoc b: and I didn't realize there was " uh oh I 'm about to read this and I should " {disfmarker} grad a: Actually it 's about one third each . About one third of them are blank , about one third of them are when the digits are read , and about one third of them are when the {pause} meeting starts . So . phd e: Oh . postdoc b: This would be a radical suggestion but {disfmarker} grad a: I could put instructions ? Nah . postdoc b: Ei - either that or maybe you could maybe write down when people {vocalsound} start reading digits on that particular session . phd e: Yeah . grad a: But if I 'm not at the meeting , I can't do that . postdoc b: I know , OK . That 's a good point . professor c: Yeah , he 's been setting stuff up and going away . So . postdoc b: I see . Good point good point . professor c: For some reason he doesn't want to sit through every meeting that 's {disfmarker} grad a: Yep , but that is the reason Name , Email and Time are where they are . postdoc b: Oh , OK . Alright . professor c: Yeah . postdoc b: I rest my {disfmarker} grad a: And then the others are later on . professor c: Uh - huh . postdoc b: OK . w phd e: And the Seat is this number ? grad a: Mm - hmm . postdoc b: Seat and Session . phd d: " For official use only " That 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well , he 's very professional . phd e: " use only " postdoc b: Actually you could {disfmarker} Well that does raise another question , which is why is the " Professional use only " line not higher ? Why doesn't it come in at the point of Date and Seat ? Oh . Because we 're filling in other things . grad a: What ? professor c: What ? postdoc b: Well , because {disfmarker} If y your {disfmarker} your professional use , you 're gonna already have the date , and the s grad a: What {disfmarker} which form are you talking about ? postdoc b: Well I 'm comparing the new one with the old one . This is the digit form . phd e: Oh . grad a: Oh you 're talking about the digit form . professor c: Digit . Digit form . phd e: Yeah . grad a: The digit form doesn't {disfmarker} The digit {disfmarker} postdoc b: Oh ! I wasn't supposed to {disfmarker} phd e: Yeah . grad a: No , that 's alright . postdoc b: Sorry . Sorry . grad a: The digit form doesn't have a " for official use only " line . It just has a line , {pause} which is what you 're supposed to read . postdoc b: That {disfmarker} uh OK . grad a: So on the digits form , everything above the line is a fill - in form postdoc b: Sorry about that . Yeah . grad a: and everything below the line is digits that the user reads . postdoc b: Yeah . OK . Alright s but I didn't mean to derail our discussion here , so you really wanted to start with this other form . grad a: No , either way is fine I just {disfmarker} You just started talking about something , and I didn't know which form you were referring to . postdoc b: Alright yeah , I was comparing {disfmarker} so th this is {disfmarker} So I was looking at the change first . So it 's like we started with this and now we 've got a new version of it wi {pause} with reference to this . So the digit form , we had one already . Now the f the fields are slightly different . professor c: So the main thing that the person fills out um {pause} is the name and email and time ? phd e: Yeah . grad a: Right . professor c: You do the rest ? phd e: Ah ! grad a: Yep . Just as uh {disfmarker} as I have for all the others . postdoc b: What {disfmarker} And there 's an addition of the native language , which is a bit redundant . professor c: Right . postdoc b: This one has Native Language and this one does too . grad a: That 's because the one , the digit form that has native language is the old form not the new form . postdoc b: Oh ! Thank you . {pause} Thank you , thank you . There we go . phd e: Yeah . postdoc b: Oh , yeah . I 'll catch up here . OK , I see . professor c: " South Midland , North Midland " postdoc b: That 's the old and that 's the new . grad a: Yeah this was the problem with these categories , I {disfmarker} I picked those categories from TIMIT . I don't know what those are . phd d: Actually , the only way I know is from working with the database and having to figure it out . phd e: What {disfmarker} grad a: With TIMIT , yeah ? phd e: uh - huh . grad a: So , I was gonna ask phd e: What i professor c: So is South Midland like Kansas ? grad a: wh w I mean . professor c: and North Midland like {disfmarker} like uh Illinois , or {disfmarker} ? phd d: Well yeah . Nor - um {disfmarker} phd e: Yeah . grad a: So {disfmarker} so what accent are we speaking ? Western ? professor c: By definition ? phd e: And for simple for {disfmarker} for me ? professor c: Well , phd d: Probably Western , yeah . phd e: Is mean my native language Spanish {disfmarker} Spanish ? eh The original is the center of Spain and the {vocalsound} beca grad a: Yeah , I mean you could call it whatever you want . For the foreign language we couldn't classify every single one . So I just left it blank and you can put whatever you want . phd e: Because is different , the Span - uh {pause} the Spanish language from the {disfmarker} the north of Spain , of the south , of the west and the {disfmarker} grad a: Sure . phd e: But . grad a: So I 'm not sure what to do about the Region field for English variety . You know , when I wrote {disfmarker} I was writing those down , I was thinking , " You know , these are great {pause} if you 're a linguist " . phd e: Yeah . grad a: But I don't know how to {disfmarker} I don't know how to {disfmarker} I don't know how to categorize them . postdoc b: Yeah . phd d: Actually even if you {vocalsound} {pause} t postdoc b: Yeah . professor c: If you 're {disfmarker} if e {vocalsound} if y phd d: This wasn't developed by {disfmarker} th these regions weren't {disfmarker} professor c: if you 're a TI or MIT {vocalsound} from {vocalsound} nineteen eighty - five . grad a: Yeah So I guess my only question was if {disfmarker} if you were a South Midland speaking region , person ? Would you know it ? professor c: Yeah . phd d: Mm - hmm . grad a: Is that what you would call yourself ? phd d: I don't know . grad a: Yeah . professor c: You know , I think if you 're talking {disfmarker} if you 're thinking in terms of places , {pause} as opposed to {pause} names different peop names people have given to {pause} different ways of talking , {pause} I would think North Midwest , and South Midwest would be more common than saying Midland , right , I mean , I {disfmarker} I went to s phd d: Yeah . Now {pause} the usage {disfmarker} Maybe we can give them a li {pause} like a little map ? with the regions and they just {disfmarker} No , I 'm serious . postdoc b: No , that 's not bad . Yeah . phd d: Because it takes less time , and it 's sort of cute phd e: i at this {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in that side {disfmarker} in that side of the {disfmarker} the paper . phd d: there 's no figure . professor c: Well . phd d: Well just a little {disfmarker} You know , it doesn't have all the detail , but you sort of {disfmarker} professor c: But what if you moved five times and {disfmarker} and uh postdoc b: Well , I was thinking you could have ma multiple ones and then the amount of time {disfmarker} phd d: No , but you 're categorized . That 's the same {disfmarker} postdoc b: so , roughly . So . You could say , {pause} you know " ten years {pause} on the east coast , five years on the west coast " or something or other . grad a: Well , We {disfmarker} I think we don't want to get that level of detail at this form . I think that 's alright if we want to follow up . But . professor c: I guess we don't really know . phd d: I mean I {disfmarker} As I said , I don't think there 's a huge {pause} benefit to this region thing . It {disfmarker} it gets {disfmarker} The problem is that for some things it 's really clear and usually listening to {comment} it you can tell right away if it 's a New York or Boston accent , but New York and Boston are two {disfmarker} well , I guess they have the NYC , but New England has a bunch of very different dialects and {disfmarker} postdoc b: Mm - hmm . phd d: and {pause} so does um S So do other places . grad a: Yeah , so I picked these regions cuz we had talked about TIMIT , and those are right from TIMIT . phd d: Right . And so these would be {pause} satisfying like a speech {pause} research {pause} community if we released the database , grad a: So . phd d: but as to whether subjects know where they 're from , I 'm not sure because um I know that they had to fill this out for Switchboard . This is i almost exactly the same as Switchboard regions postdoc b: Oh . OK . phd d: or very close . Yeah . Um And I don't know how they filled that out . But th if Midland {disfmarker} Yeah , Midland is the one that 's difficult I guess . postdoc b: I think a lot of people {disfmarker} Yeah . phd d: Also Northwest you 've got Oreg - Washington and Oregon now which uh y people don't know if it 's western or northern . grad a: Yeah , I certainly don't . I mean , I was saying I don't even know what I speak . phd d: It 's like Northwest grad a: Am I speaking {disfmarker} Am I speaking Western ? professor c: Oh , what is Northern ? Well and what {disfmarker} and what 's Northern ? phd d: I think originally it was North {disfmarker} Northwest grad a: Northwest ? phd d: But {disfmarker} phd e: Yeah . grad a: Yeah , so this is a real problem . I don't know what to do about it . phd d: Yeah . postdoc b: I wouldn't know how to characterize mine either . And {disfmarker} and so I would think {disfmarker} I would say , I 've {disfmarker} I 've got a mix of California and Ohio . grad a: I c I think at the first level , for example , we speak the same . phd d: I don't know . grad a: our {disfmarker} our dialects Or {pause} whatever you {disfmarker} region are the same . postdoc b: Uh - huh . grad a: But I don't know what it is . So . phd d: Well , you have a like techno - speak accent I think . grad a: a techno - speak accent ? phd d: Yeah , you know ? phd e: A techno grad a: A {disfmarker} a geek region ? phd d: Well it 's {disfmarker} I mean I {disfmarker} you can sort of identify postdoc b: Geek region . phd d: it f It 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} not that that 's {disfmarker} phd e: Is different . Is different . phd d: but {disfmarker} but maybe that {disfmarker} maybe we could leave this and see what people {disfmarker} See what people choose and then um let them just fill in if they don't {disfmarker} I mean I don't know what else we can do , cuz {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That 's North Midland . postdoc b: I 'm wondering about a question like , " Where are you from mostly ? " phd e: Yeah . professor c: But I {disfmarker} I 'm s I 'm {disfmarker} now that you mentioned it though , I am {disfmarker} really am confused by " Northern " . phd e: Yeah . postdoc b: I agree . I agree . professor c: I really am . postdoc b: I agree . professor c: I mean , if {disfmarker} if you 're {pause} in New England , that 's North . phd e: Yeah . professor c: If you 're {disfmarker} i if you 're postdoc b: Scandinavian , the Minnesota area 's north . professor c: Uh yeah . That 's {disfmarker} But that 's also North Midland , phd e: Yeah . postdoc b: Oh , @ @ . {disfmarker} OK . professor c: right ? postdoc b:  professor c: And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and Oregon and {disfmarker} and Oregon and Washington are {disfmarker} are Western , but they 're also Northern . phd d: Yeah . Of course , that 's very different from , like , Michigan , or {disfmarker} phd e: Mmm . postdoc b: Mm - hmm . professor c: uh , Idaho ? phd d: Well there are hardly any subjects from Idaho . professor c: Montana ? grad a: No problem . postdoc b: Just rule them out . phd d: There 's only a few people in Idaho . grad a: There are hardly any subjects from " beep " phd e: Yeah . phd d: Sorry . professor c: Maybe {disfmarker} Maybe we {disfmarker} Maybe we should put a little map and say " put an X on where you 're from " , phd d: No , that 's {disfmarker} phd e: And {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} in those {disfmarker} grad a: Yeah really . phd d: We could ask where they 're from . phd e: And if you put {disfmarker} postdoc b: It 'd be pretty simple , yeah . phd d: Yeah . But - We went back to that . phd e: Yeah . If you put eh the state ? grad a: Well well we sort of {disfmarker} postdoc b: Where are you from mostly ? phd d: We {disfmarker} we went {disfmarker} we went around this and then {pause} a lot of people ended up saying that it {disfmarker} phd e: Uh - huh . Mm - hmm . phd d: You know . grad a: Well , I like the idea of asking " what variety of English do you speak " as opposed to where you 're from Because th if we start asking where we 're from , again you have to start saying , " well , is that the language you speak or is that just where you 're from ? " phd e: Yeah . postdoc b: Hmm ? phd d: Right . Right . phd e: Yeah . professor c: Let 's {disfmarker} Mm - hmm . phd d: I mean it gives us good information on where they 're from , but that doesn't {comment} tell us anything {disfmarker} grad a: And {disfmarker} professor c: We could always ask them if they 're from {disfmarker} phd d: well , enough about their {disfmarker} grad a: I mean . So {disfmarker} so I would say Germany phd d: like {disfmarker} grad a: You know am I speaking with German accent postdoc b: Oh . grad a: I don't think so . postdoc b: Well , see , I 'm thinking " Where are you from mostly " phd d: Right . grad a: Oh , OK yeah . postdoc b: because , you know , then you have some {disfmarker} some kind of subjective amount of time factored into it . phd e: Yeah . Yeah . grad a: Yep . Yeah , I guess I could try to put {disfmarker} squeeze in a little map . phd e: Yeah . grad a: I mean there 's not a lot of r of room professor c: I 'd say , uh , " Boston , New York City , the South and Regular " . postdoc b: Well {disfmarker} phd d: Oh , I don't know . grad a: I think of those , Northern is the only one that I don't even know what they 're meaning . postdoc b: Yeah . Yeah . phd e: And {disfmarker} And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um {pause} And usually here {disfmarker} people here know what is their kind of mmm lang English language ? professor c: That 's a joke . That 's {disfmarker} phd d: So let 's make it up . S I mean , who cares . Right ? We can make up our own {disfmarker} So we can say " Northwest " , " Rest of West " or something . You know . " West " and I mean . grad a: Ye I don't think the Northwest people speak any differently than I do . phd d: It doesn't even {disfmarker} Yeah , exactly . That 's not really a region . postdoc b: I {disfmarker} professor c: " Do you come from the Louisiana Purchase ? " phd d: So we could take out " North " {disfmarker} " Northern " . grad a: That {disfmarker} that 's exactly what we 're arguing about . phd e: eh here Is easy for people to know ? phd d: That 's {disfmarker} Yeah , w It 's {disfmarker} In {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker} it 's harder in America anywhere else , basically . grad a: We don't know . phd e: because you have {disfmarker} grad a: I mean some of them are very obvious . If you {disfmarker} if you talk to someone speaking with Southern drawl , you know . phd e: N m Yeah . postdoc b: Yeah , or Boston . grad a: Or Boston , yeah . postdoc b: I can't do it , but {disfmarker} phd e: Or Boston ? professor c: Yeah . phd d: And those people , if you ask them to self - identify their accent they know . phd e: Yeah . postdoc b: Yeah , they do . phd d: They know very well . postdoc b: Yeah I agree I agree . I agree . phd d: They know they don't speak the same as the grad a: But is Boston New England ? postdoc b: And they 're proud of it . phd d: day o postdoc b: Yeah . phd d: Yeah , exactly . postdoc b: It 's identity thing . phd d: And they 're glad to tell you . phd e: style . phd d: Well . Depends who you ask , I suppose . grad a: W {vocalsound} I guess that 's the problem with these categories . phd e:  phd d: But that 's why they have New York City but {disfmarker} postdoc b: Well , we ca Well , why can't we just say characterize {disfmarker} something like char characterize your accent professor c: Well , Boston 's @ @ , too . phd d: Or {disfmarker} " Characterize your accent {pause} if you can . " postdoc b: and {disfmarker} and so I would say , " I don't know " . phd d: Yeah . Right , which probably means you have a very {disfmarker} postdoc b: But someone from Boston with a really strong coloration would know . And so would an R - less Maine {disfmarker} or something , phd d: And that 's actually good . phd e: Yeah . postdoc b: yeah . phd d: I was {disfmarker} I was thinking of something along that line professor c: How postdoc b: Good . phd d: because {pause} if you don't know , then , you know , ruling out the fact that you 're totally {pause} inept or something , postdoc b: Hmm . phd d: if somebody doesn't know , it probably means their accent isn't very strong compared to the sort of midwest standard . professor c: Well , {vocalsound} I mean , it wasn't that long ago that we had somebody here who was from Texas who was absolutely sure that he didn't have any accent left . postdoc b: Hmm ? professor c: And {disfmarker} and had {disfmarker} he had a pretty {vocalsound} noticeable drawl . grad a: OK , so . I propose , {pause} take out Northern add , don't know . postdoc b: Oh . {pause} Yeah . I {disfmarker} I would say more {disfmarker} more sweepingly , " how would you characterize your accent ? " phd e: Yeah . grad a: So you want to change the instructions also not just say region ? phd d: W postdoc b: Well , I think this discussion has made me think that 's s something to consider . grad a: I don't know if I {disfmarker} if I read this form , I think they 're going to ask {comment} it {disfmarker} they 're going to answer the same way if you say , " What 's variety of English do you speak ? Region . " as if you say " what variety of region {disfmarker} region {comment} do you speak ? Please characterize your accent ? " They 're going to answer the same way . postdoc b: I guess {disfmarker} Well , I was not sure that {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} phd e: Mmm . postdoc b: So . I was suggesting not having the options , just having them {disfmarker} grad a: Oh , I see . phd e: Huh . grad a: Well what we talked about with that is {pause} is so that they would understand the granularity . postdoc b: Yes , but if , as Liz is suggesting , people who have strong accents know that they do {disfmarker} grad a: I mean that 's what I had before , and you told me to list the regions to list them . postdoc b: and are {disfmarker} Well , I know . professor c: Right . phd d: Each {disfmarker} each one has pros and cons grad a: So . professor c: Right . postdoc b: That 's true . professor c: Right . phd d: I mean we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} professor c: Yeah last week {disfmarker} last week I was sort of r arguing for having it wide open , but then everybody said " Oh , no , but then it will be hard to interpret because some people will say Cincinnati and some will say Ohio " . grad a: I mean I had it wide open last week and {disfmarker} and you said TIMIT . professor c: And . postdoc b: Yeah . professor c: Yeah . phd d: What if we put in both ? grad a: That 's what the " Other " is for . phd d: And {disfmarker} Would people {disfmarker} No , I mean what if we put in both ways of asking them ? So . One is {pause} Region and the another one is " if you had to characterize yourself {disfmarker} your accent , what would you say ? " grad a: Won't they answer the same thing ? phd d: Well they might only answer only one of the questions but if postdoc b: Yeah that 's fine . phd d: You know . postdoc b: They might say " Other " for Region because they don't know what category to use phd d: Actually {disfmarker} postdoc b: but they might have something {disfmarker} phd d: Right . postdoc b: because it is easier to have it open ended . phd d: It just {disfmarker} And we {disfmarker} we might learn from what they say , as to which one 's a better {comment} way to ask it . professor c: W This is just a small thing phd d: But {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Cuz I really don't know .  professor c: but um It says " Variety " and then it gives things that e have American as one of the choices . But then it says " Region " , but Region actually just applies to uh , US , grad a: Right . professor c: right ? grad a: I mean that 's why I put the " Other " in . postdoc b: Well , we thought about it . professor c: Ah , OK . postdoc b: Yeah , OK . We just {disfmarker} We sort of thought , " yes , {disfmarker} " y y I mean {disfmarker} professor c: S postdoc b: At the last meeting , my recollection was that {pause} we felt people would have uh less {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that there are so many types and varieties of {pause} these other languages and we are not going to have that many subjects from these different language groups grad a: Yep . postdoc b: and that it 's a huge waste of {disfmarker} of space . professor c: OK . grad a: So I mean , I {disfmarker} I mean the way I had it last time {pause} was Region was blank , postdoc b: That 's what I thought . grad a: it just said Region colon . postdoc b: Yeah . grad a: And {disfmarker} and I think that that 's the best way to do it , postdoc b: Yeah . grad a: because {disfmarker} because of the problems we 're talking about but what we said last week , was no , put in a list , so I put in a list . So should we go back to {disfmarker} phd d: Maybe we can make the list a little smaller . grad a: Well , certainly dropping " Northern " I think is right , because none of us know what that is . phd d: Cuz , I mean {disfmarker} And keeping " Other " , and then {pause} maybe this North Midland , we call it " North Midwest " . South {pause} Midwest , or just {disfmarker} professor c: Yes I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think so . Yeah . phd d: South Midwest . Does that make sense ? phd e: South Midwest ? phd d: That would help me {disfmarker} professor c: U unless you 're from Midland , Kansas . phd d: Yeah . Cuz {disfmarker} Midland {disfmarker} professor c: But . Yeah . phd d: I don't know where Midland is professor c: There 's a {disfmarker} Or Midland {disfmarker} Midland {disfmarker} grad a: Is " Midwest " one word ? professor c: Is it Midland {disfmarker} Midland {disfmarker} Midland , Texas or Midland , Kansas ? I forget . phd d: Y yeah , one w professor c: But there 's a town . in {disfmarker} in there . phd d: Oh . professor c: I forget what it is @ @ . postdoc b: I don't think that 's what they mean . phd d: But , professor c: Yeah . phd d: yeah . So . Kansas would be {pause} South Midland . Right ? professor c: Y yeah . phd d: And {disfmarker} and wouldn't {disfmarker} Yeah . professor c: And Colorado , right across the border , would be {vocalsound} North Midland . phd d: So , th I 'm from Kansas , actually . phd e: Southern Midland .  phd d: Yeah . grad a: And uh {disfmarker} phd d: Colora Oh , right . And then , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} dropping North , so it would be Western . It 's just one big shebang , where , of course , you have huge variation in dialects , grad a: But that 's true of New England too . professor c: But you do in the others , too . So . phd d: but {disfmarker} {comment} but so do you {disfmarker} grad a: So . I mean only one {disfmarker} phd d: Yeah . professor c: Yeah . phd d: Yeah . Yeah . grad a: Well , I shouldn't say that . I have no clue . I was going to say the only one that doesn't have a huge variety is New York City . But I have no idea whether it does or not . postdoc b: It does seem {disfmarker} I mean . I {disfmarker} I would think that these categories would be more {disfmarker} w would be easier for an an analyst to put in rather than the subject himself . professor c: U grad a: I think that {disfmarker} that was what happened with TIMIT , was that it was an analyst . postdoc b: OK . professor c: Wait a minute . Where does {disfmarker} Where does {disfmarker} {pause} d w Where {disfmarker} Where 's {disfmarker} where does uh {vocalsound} New {disfmarker} New York west of {disfmarker} west of uh New York City and {pause} Pennsylvania {pause} uh and uh phd d: Yeah , I don't know how it came from . postdoc b: OK . grad a: New England phd d: So . That 's New England I think . professor c: N No , it 's not . phd d: Yeah . grad a: Oh , no . postdoc b: I sort of thought they were part of the {disfmarker} one of the Midlands . professor c: Oh no . No , no . {pause} No . Pennsylvania is not {disfmarker} grad a: " Other " , it goes under " Other " , definitely under " Other " . phd d: Well , you know , Pennsylvania has a pretty strong dialect and it 's totally different than {disfmarker} professor c: Pennsylvania {disfmarker} Yeah . Pennsylvania is not New England . and uh New Jersey is not New England and Maryland is not New England and none of those are the South . grad a: OK . So . Another suggestion . Rather than have circle fill in forms , say " Region , open paren , E G Southern comma Western comma close paren colon . " postdoc b: Yeah . OK . phd d: OK ! postdoc b: Fine by me , fine by me . professor c: That 's good . I like that . phd d: Sure ! phd e: Yeah . postdoc b: Yeah . professor c: We 're all {pause} sufficiently {pause} tired of this that we 're agreeing with you . phd d: Let 's just {disfmarker} And we 'll see what we get . phd e: Yeah . postdoc b: Be easier on the subjects . I think that 's fine . No . I think {disfmarker} professor c: So . postdoc b: I like that . I like that . professor c: You like it ? postdoc b: Yeah , I do . professor c: OK . grad a: Actually , maybe we do one non - English one as well . professor c: Good . grad a: Southern , Cockney ? phd d: Yeah , and {disfmarker} phd e: Yeah . grad a: Is that a {pause} real accent ? postdoc b: Sure , yeah ! grad a: How do you spell it ? phd e: Yeah . postdoc b: I think that 's fine . professor c: Cockney ? grad a: N E professor c: CO {disfmarker} Yeah . phd d: You could say Liverpool . professor c: Liverpuddlian . postdoc b: Yeah . Alright . phd d: Actually , Liverpool doesn't l Yeah . It 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I 'm s I ha postdoc b: Well . Well . I mean , pure {disfmarker} grad a: OK , we 'll do it that way . Actually , I like that a lot . Because that get 's at both of the things we were trying to do , professor c: OK . grad a: the granularity , and the person can just self - assess and we don't have to argue about what these regions are . postdoc b: That 's right . And it 's easy on the subjects . professor c: OK . phd e: Yeah . grad a: Yep . postdoc b: Now I have one suggestion on the next section . phd e: Mm - hmm . grad a: Mm - hmm . postdoc b: So you have native language , you have region , and then you have time spent in English speaking country . Now , I wonder if it might be useful to have another open field saying " which one parenthesis S {comment} paren closed parenthesis " . Cuz if they spent {pause} time in {disfmarker} in Britain and America {disfmarker} professor c: Yes . postdoc b: It doesn't have to be ex all {disfmarker} at all exact , just in the same open field format that you have . grad a: Yep , just which one . I think that 's fine . postdoc b: Mm - hmm . with a {disfmarker} with an S phd e: Mm - hmm . postdoc b: " which one sss , {comment} optional S . professor c: OK . phd e:  postdoc b: Yeah . professor c: We uh {disfmarker} We done ? grad a: Yep . postdoc b: Yeah , that 's good . professor c: OK . um s e Any {disfmarker} any other uh open mike topics or should we go {pause} right to the digits ? grad a: Um , did you guys get my email on the multitrans ? That {disfmarker} OK . postdoc b: Isn't that wonderful ! Yeah . grad a: Yeah . So . So . I {disfmarker} I have a version also which actually displays all the channels . postdoc b: Excellent ! Thank you ! phd d: It 's really great . grad a: But it 's hideously slow . postdoc b: So you {disfmarker} this is n Dan 's patches , Dan Ellis 's patches . grad a: The {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} the ones I applied , that you can actually do are Dan 's , because it doesn't slow it down . phd d: M postdoc b: Fantastic ! grad a: Just uses a lot of memory . phd d: So when you say " slow " , does that mean to {disfmarker} grad a: No , the {disfmarker} the one that 's installed is fine . It 's not slow at all . I wrote another version . Which , instead of having the one pane with the one view , It has multiple panes {pause} with the views . phd e: Yeah . phd d: Mm - hmm . grad a: But the problem with it is the drawing of those waveforms is so slow that every time you do anything it just crawls . postdoc b: Mm - hmm . grad a: It 's really bad . phd d: It 's {disfmarker} So , it {disfmarker} it 's the redrawing of the w postdoc b: That 's a consideration . grad a: Mm - hmm . phd d: oh uh - huh , w as you move . grad a: As you play , as you move , as you scroll . Just about anything , and it {disfmarker} it was so slow it was not usable . So that 's why I didn't install it and didn't pursue it . postdoc b: And this 'll be a {disfmarker} hav having the multiwave will be a big help cuz {disfmarker} in terms of like disentangling overlaps and things , that 'll be a big help . phd d: Oh yeah . grad a: So . I think that the one Dan has is usable enough . phd d: Yeah . grad a: It doesn't display the others . It displays just the mixed signal . postdoc b: Mm - hmm . grad a: But you can listen to any of them . postdoc b: That 's excellent . He also has version control which is another nice phd e: Yeah . postdoc b: e so you {disfmarker} e the patches that you {disfmarker} grad a: No , he suggested that , but he didn't {disfmarker} {pause} It 's not installed . postdoc b: Oh , I thought it was in one of those patches . grad a: No . No . postdoc b: Oh OK . Well . Alright . phd d: So is there any hope for actually displaying the wave form ? grad a: Um , not if we 're going to use Tcl - TK At least not if we 're going to use Snack . phd d: OK . grad a: I mean you would have to do something ourselves . postdoc b: Well , or use the one that crawls . phd d: OK . Well , I 'm {disfmarker} I probably would be trying to use the {disfmarker} {comment} whatever 's there . And it 's useful to have the {disfmarker} grad a: Why don't we {disfmarker} we see how Dan 's works and if it {disfmarker} If we really need the display {disfmarker} phd d: Yeah . I mean . I wonder {disfmarker} I 'm just wondering if we can display things other than the wave form . So . Suppose we have a feature {disfmarker} a feature stream . And it 's just , you know , a {disfmarker} a uni - dimensional feature , varying in time . phd e: Yeah . phd d: And we want to plot that , instead of the whole wave form . grad a: I mean . phd d: That might be faster . phd e: Yeah . phd d: Right ? grad a: We {disfmarker} we could do that but that would mean changing the code . phd d: So . phd e: Yeah . grad a: I mean this isn't a program we wrote . professor c: Yeah . grad a: This is a program that we got from someone else , and we 've done patches on . phd d: OK . postdoc b: Mm - hmm . phd d: OK . Well , I 'll talk to you about it and we can see grad a: So . professor c: Cou - i e I mean , y phd e: Yeah . grad a: Yeah . phd d: but it 's definitely {pause} great to have the other one . professor c: If there was some {disfmarker} Is there some way to {pause} have someone write patches in something faster and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} link it in , or something ? phd d: That 's {disfmarker} grad a: Not easily . professor c: Or is that {disfmarker} grad a: I mean y yes we could do that . You could {disfmarker} you can write widgets in C . And try to do it that way but I just don't think {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} professor c: Yeah . grad a: Let 's try it with Dan 's and if that isn't enough , we can do it otherwise . phd d: Right . grad a: I think it is , cuz when I was playing with it , the mixed signal has it all in there . And so it 's really {disfmarker} It 's not too bad to find places in the {disfmarker} in the stream where things are happening . phd d: OK . grad a: So I {disfmarker} I don't think it 'll be bad . postdoc b: And it 's also {disfmarker} also the case that {disfmarker} that uh this multi - wave thing {pause} is proposed to the {disfmarker} phd e: Hmm ? postdoc b: So . Dan proposed it to the Transcriber central people , and it 's likely that uh {disfmarker} So . And {disfmarker} and they responded favorably looks as though it will be incorporated in the future version . phd d: Oh . postdoc b: They said that the only reason they hadn't had the multi the parallel uh stream one before was simply that {pause} they hadn't had time to do it . And uh {pause} so it 's likely that this {disfmarker} this may be entered into the ch this central @ @ . phd e: Yeah . grad a: And if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} professor c: They may well have not had much demand for it . postdoc b: Well that 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that 's true , too . professor c: Yeah . postdoc b: This is a {disfmarker} {pause} a useful thing for us . phd d: So . You mean they could {disfmarker} they could do it and it would be {pause} fast enough if they do it ? phd e: Yeah . grad a: Depends on how much work they did . postdoc b: Oh . No . I just mean {disfmarker} I just mean that it 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that his {disfmarker} phd d: Or {disfmarker} ? phd e: Oh . postdoc b: So . {pause} This one that we now have does have the status of {pause} potentially being incorporated l likely being incorporated into the central code . phd d: Mm - hmm . OK . postdoc b: Now , tha Now , if we develop further then , y uh , I don't {disfmarker} grad a: I think if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if one of us sat down and coded it , so that it could be displayed fast enough I 'm sure they would be quite willing to incorporate it . postdoc b: I mean it 's {disfmarker} I think it 's a nice feature to have it {disfmarker} set that way . Mm - hmm . grad a: But it 's not a trivial task . postdoc b: Mm - hmm . Yeah . phd d: OK . postdoc b: I just like the idea of it being something that 's , you know , tied back into the original , so that other people can benefit from it . grad a: Yeah . postdoc b: Yeah . However . I also understand that you can have {pause} widgets that are very useful for their purpose and that you don't need to always go that w route . Yeah . phd e: OK . grad a: anyway , shall we do digits ? postdoc b: Yeah . professor c: Yeah . Let 's do digits , uh , and then we 'll turn off the mikes , and then I have one other thing to discuss . postdoc b: OK . grad a: OK . phd d: I actually have to leave . So . Um . I mean {pause} I had to leave at three thirty , postdoc b: Uh - oh . grad a: OK . professor c: Oh . phd d: so I can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well , I can wait {pause} for the digits but I can't stay for the discussion grad a: Well , you want to go first ? Or . phd d: I c {pause} I have to make a call . professor c: OK . phd d: So . postdoc b: Well , should we {disfmarker} e should we switch off the g professor c: Well , we 'll talk to you about it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh grad a: Do you wanna go do digits or do you wanna just skip digits ? phd d: Um . No , I can do digits if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} But I don't wanna butt in , or something . grad a: Then {disfmarker} Alright . You go ahead . phd d: But if there 's something on the rest of the {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'll be around just have to make call before quarter of . So . phd e: Mm - hmm . phd d: So I {disfmarker} Or we can talk about it . postdoc b: Ke grad a: Why don't you read the digits ? professor c: Yeah , why don't you read the digits and then you can {pause} go . phd d: OK . {vocalsound} Alright . Oh , this is the new one . grad a: Yeah , don't {disfmarker} Don't read the old one . professor c: Yeah . phd d: Alright . The {disfmarker} And the time is . OK . grad a: OK postdoc b: Turn it off . professor c: OK . postdoc b: But wait till he {disfmarker} OK . grad a: And
