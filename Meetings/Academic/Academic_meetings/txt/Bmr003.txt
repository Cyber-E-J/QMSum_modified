grad a: OK , this is one channel . Can you uh , say your name and talk into your mike one at a time ? phd c: This is Eric on channel three , I believe . grad a: OK . Uh , I don't think it 's on there , Jane . undergrad d: Tasting one two three , tasting . postdoc e: OK , this is Jane on channel five . grad a: Uh , I still don't see you Jane . postdoc e: Oh , darn , what am I doing wrong ? undergrad d: Can you see me on channel four ? Really ? grad a: Yeah , I s undergrad d: My lucky day . postdoc e: Uh , screen no , {disfmarker} it is , oh , maybe it just warmed up ? grad a: No . postdoc e: Oh , darn , can you can't see channel five yet ? grad a: Uh , well , the mike isn't close enough to your mouth , so . postdoc e: Oh , this would be k OK , is that better ? grad a: S uh , try speaking loudly , undergrad d: I like the high quality labelling . grad a: so , postdoc e: Hello , grad a: OK , good . undergrad d: David , can we borrow your labelling machine to improve the quality of the labelling a little bit here ? postdoc e: hello . Alright . grad a: Thank you . phd b: One t undergrad d: How {disfmarker} how many are there , one to five ? phd b: One five , yeah . undergrad d: Yeah , please . postdoc e: Would you like to join the meeting ? grad a: Well , we don't wanna renumber them , postdoc e: I bet {disfmarker} grad a: cuz we 've already have like , forms filled out with the numbers on them . So , let 's keep the same numbers on them . phd b: Yeah , OK , that 's a good idea . grad a: OK , Dan , are you on ? phd b: I 'm on {disfmarker} I 'm on two and I should be on . grad a: Good . phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: Want to join the meeting , Dave ? Do we {disfmarker} do {disfmarker} do we have a spare , uh {disfmarker} grad a: And I 'm getting lots of responses on different ones , so I assume {pause} the various and assorted P Z Ms are on . undergrad d: We ' r we 're {disfmarker} we ' r This is {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} this is a meeting meeting . postdoc e: This is abou we 're {disfmarker} we 're mainly being taped but we 're gonna talk about , uh , transcription for the m future meeting meetings . grad a: Stuff . Yeah , this is not something you need to attend . So . postdoc e: Yeah . e OK . phd c: You 're always having one of those days , Dave . postdoc e: Y you 'd be welcome . grad a: Besides , I don't want anyone who has a weird accent . postdoc e: You 'd be welcome . grad a: Right , Dan ? undergrad d: So , I don't understand if it 's neck mounted you don't get very good performance . phd c: It 's not neck mounted . It 's supposed to be h head mounted . undergrad d: Yeah . It {disfmarker} it should be head mounted . Right ? grad a: Well , then put it on your head . phd b: I don't know . phd c: Right . grad a: What are you doing ? undergrad d: Cuz when you do this , you can {disfmarker} Rouww - Rouww . postdoc e: Why didn't I {disfmarker} you were saying that but I could hear you really well on the {disfmarker} on the transcription {disfmarker} on the , uh , tape . grad a: Well , I m I would prefer that people wore it on their head phd b: I {disfmarker} I don't know . phd c: i grad a: but they were complaining about it . Because it 's not {disfmarker} it doesn't go over the ears . undergrad d: Why ? postdoc e: It 's badly designed . grad a: It 's very badly designed so it 's {disfmarker} phd b: It 's very badly designed ? undergrad d: What do you mean it doesn't go over the ears ? phd b: Why ? It 's not s It 's not supposed to cover up your ears . grad a: Yeah but , there 's nowhere to put the pad so it 's comfortable . phd b: I mean , it 's only badly {disfmarker} postdoc e: So that 's what you 're d He 's got it on his temples so it cuts off his circulation . phd b: Oh , that 's strange . phd c: Yeah , that 's {disfmarker} that 's what I have . grad a: And it feels so good that way . phd c: It feels so good when I stop . grad a: So I {disfmarker} I again would like to do some digits . undergrad d: Somebody wanna {disfmarker} postdoc e: Try it . grad a: Um . undergrad d: Somebody wanna close the door ? grad a: Sure . phd b: OK . postdoc e: We could do it with noise . grad a: So let me {disfmarker} phd c: You 're always doing digits . grad a: Well , you know , I 'm just that sort of {disfmarker} digit - y g sorta guy . OK . So this is Adam . postdoc e: Uh , this is the same one I had before . grad a: I doubt it . phd b: It 's still the same words . grad a: I think we 're session four by the way . Or m it might be five . undergrad d: Psss ! Oh , that 's good . postdoc e: No grad a: I didn't bring my previous thing . phd b: We didn't {disfmarker} postdoc e: Now , just to be sure , the numbers on the back , this is the channel ? phd b: That 's the microphone number . postdoc e: That 's the microphone number . grad a: Yeah , d leave the channel blank . postdoc e: Uh - oh . OK , good . undergrad d: But number has to be {disfmarker} ? So we have to look up the number . postdoc e: Five {disfmarker} grad a: Right . undergrad d: OK , good . postdoc e: Good . OK . Well , this is Jane , on mike number five . Um . I just start ? Do I need to say anything more ? grad a: Uh , transcript number . phd b: Transcript number {disfmarker} phd c: OK , this is Eric on microphone number three , undergrad d: This is Beck on mike four . grad a: Thanks . Should I turn off the VU meter Dan ? Do you think that makes any difference ? phd b: Oh , God . No , let me do it . grad a: Why ? Are you gonna do something other than hit " quit " ? phd b: No , but I 'm gonna look at the uh , logs as well . grad a: Oh . Should have done it before . postdoc e: Uh , you said turn off the what ? grad a: The VU meter which tells you what the levels on the various mikes are and there was one hypothesis that perhaps that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the act of recording the VU meter was one of the things that contributed to the errors . postdoc e: Oh . Oh , I see . undergrad d: Yeah , but Eric , uh , you didn't think that was a reasonable hypothesis , right ? postdoc e: I See . grad a: That was me , undergrad d: Oh , I 'm sorry y grad a: I thought that was {disfmarker} undergrad d: That was malarkey . grad a: Well , the only reason that could be is if the driver has a bug . Right ? Because the machine just isn't very heavily loaded . undergrad d: No chance of that . grad a: No chance of that . Just because it 's beta . Look OK ? phd b: Yeah , there {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there was {disfmarker} there was a {disfmarker} there was a bug . There was a glitch last time we ran . undergrad d: Are - are yo are you recording where the table mikes are by the way ? phd b: No . undergrad d: Do you know which channels {disfmarker} grad a: Yeah , we usually do that . phd b: No , we don't . grad a: Yeah . phd b: But we {disfmarker} we ought to st we ought to standardize . undergrad d: Why not ? phd b: I think , {vocalsound} uh , I s I spoke to somebody , Morgan , {comment} about that . I think {disfmarker} I think we should put mar Well , no , w we can do that . undergrad d: Why don't you just do this ? grad a: I mean , that 's what we 've done before . phd b: I know what they {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're four , three , two , one . In order now . undergrad d: Four . phd b: Three , two , {vocalsound} and one . undergrad d: Three . phd b: But I think {disfmarker} I think we should put them in standard positions . I think we should make little marks on the table top . grad a: Which means we need to move this thing , and sorta decide how we 're actually going to do things . phd b: So that we can put them {disfmarker} postdoc e: Oh , OK . phd b: I guess that 's the point . grad a: So . phd b: It 'll be a lot easier if we have a {disfmarker} if we have them permanently in place or something like that . grad a: Right . postdoc e: I do wish there were big booms coming down from the ceiling . phd b: You do ? postdoc e: Yeah . phd c: Would it make you feel more important ? grad a: Mmm . postdoc e: Yeah , yeah , yeah . phd c: I see . undergrad d: Wait till the projector gets installed . postdoc e: You know . grad a: That 'll work . postdoc e: Oh , that 'll be good . grad a: That 'll work . phd b: Oh , gosh . undergrad d: Cuz it 's gonna hang down , make noise . postdoc e: OK . phd b: When 's it gonna be installed ? postdoc e: OK . undergrad d: Well , {vocalsound} it depends on phd b: I see . undergrad d: Is this b is this being recorded ? grad a: That 's right . undergrad d: Uh , I think Lila actually is almost getting r pretty close to even getting ready to put out the purchase order . phd b: OK . Cool . undergrad d: I handed it off to her about a month ago . phd b: I see . grad a: OK , so , topic of this meeting is I wanna talk a little bit about transcription . Um , I 've looked a little bit into commercial transcription services and Jane has been working on doing transcription . Uh , and so we wan wanna decide what we 're gonna do with that and then get an update on the electronics , and then , uh , maybe also talk a little bit about some infrastructure and tools , and so on . Um , you know , eventually we 're probably gonna wanna distribute this thing and we should decide how we 're gonna {disfmarker} how we 're gonna handle some of these factors . So . phd b: Distribute what ? grad a: Hmm ? phd b: The data ? grad a: Right . Right . I mean , so we 're {disfmarker} we 're collecting a corpus and I think it 's gonna be generally useful . I mean , it seems like it 's not a corpus which is {disfmarker} uh , has been done before . And so I think people will be interested in having {disfmarker} having it , phd b: Oh . grad a: and so we will {disfmarker} undergrad d: u Using , like , audio D V Ds or something like that ? grad a: Excuse me ? phd b: Yes . undergrad d: Audio D V grad a: Well , or something . Yeah , audio D V C Ds , undergrad d: Or t grad a: you know . undergrad d: Yeah . tapes . grad a: And {disfmarker} and so how we do we distribute the transcripts , how do we distribute the audio files , how do we {disfmarker} how do we just do all that infrastructure ? phd c: Well , I think {disfmarker} I mean , for that particular issue ther there are known sources where people go to {disfmarker} to find these kind of things like the LDC for instance . postdoc e: Yeah , grad a: Right , but {disfmarker} but so should we do it in the same format as LDC postdoc e: that 's right . grad a: and what does that mean to what we 've done already ? phd b: Right . The {disfmarker} It 's not so much the actu The logistics of distribution are secondary to {pause} preparing the data in a suitable form for distribution . phd c: Right . grad a: Right . So , uh , as it is , it 's sort of a {pause} ad - hoc combination of stuff Dan set and stuff I set up , which we may wanna make a little more formal . So . phd b: And the other thing is that , um , University of Washington may want to start recording meetings as well , grad a: Right . phd b: in which case w w we 'll have to decide what we 've actually got so that we can give them a copy . grad a: That 's right . undergrad d: A field trip . grad a: Yeah . I was actually thinking I wouldn't mind spending the summer up there . That would be kind of fun . phd b: Oh , really ? grad a: Yeah . Visit my friends and spend some time {disfmarker} phd b: Different for you . Yes . grad a: Well , and then also I have a bunch of stuff for doing this digits . So I have a bunch of scripts with X Waves , and some Perl scripts , and other things that make it really easy to extract out {vocalsound} and align where the digits are . And if U d UW 's going to do the same thing I think it 's worth while for them to do these digits tasks as well . undergrad d: Mm - hmm . grad a: And what I 've done is pretty ad - hoc , um , so we might wanna change it over to something a little more standard . phd c: Hmm . grad a: You know , STM files , or XML , or something . undergrad d: An - and there 's interest up there ? grad a: What 's that ? undergrad d: There 's interest up there ? grad a: Well they {disfmarker} they certainly wanna collect more data . And so they 're applying , I think I B Is that right ? Something like that . phd b: I don't know . grad a: Um , for some more money to do more data . So we were planning to do like thirty or forty hours worth of meetings . They wanna do an additional hundred or so hours . So , they want a very large data set . Um , but of course we 're not gonna do that if we don't get money . So . phd b: I see . grad a: And I would like that just to get a disjoint speaker set and a disjoint room . I mean , one of the things Morgan and I were talking about is we 're gonna get to know this room really well , phd c: Mm - hmm . grad a: the {disfmarker} the acoustics of this room . phd b: All about that . undergrad d: Including the fan . grad a: Including the fan . undergrad d: Did you notice the fan difference ? phd b: Oh , now you 've touched the fan control , now all our data 's gonna be {disfmarker} undergrad d: Hear the difference ? grad a: Oh , it 's enormous . phd b: Yeah , it 's great . postdoc e: Oh , that 's better . undergrad d: Do you wanna leave it off or not ? postdoc e: That 's better . grad a: All the others have been on . phd b: That 's {disfmarker} undergrad d: Yeah , the {disfmarker} You sure ? phd b: Oh , yeah . grad a: y Absolut phd b: Absolutely . undergrad d: You {disfmarker} {vocalsound} You think that {disfmarker} grad a: Yeah . undergrad d: things after the f then This fan 's wired backwards by the way . Uh , I think this is high speed here . postdoc e: Yeah , it 's noticeable . undergrad d: Well , not clear . phd b: Well it 's {disfmarker} well like {vocalsound} " low " is mid {disfmarker} mid - scale . undergrad d: Maybe it {disfmarker} Maybe it isn't . phd b: So it could be {vocalsound} that it 's not actually wired backwards undergrad d: That 's right . phd b: it 's just that ambiguous . undergrad d: I was wondering also , Get ready . {comment} whether the lights made any noise . postdoc e: Uh - huh . grad a: There 's definitely {disfmarker} Yep . phd b: Oh , they do . phd c: Yeah , a little bit . phd b: Yeah . grad a: High pitch hum . Wow . undergrad d: So , {vocalsound} do our meetings in the dark with no air conditioning in the future . grad a: Yeah , just get a variety . postdoc e: I think candles would be nice if they don't make noise . grad a: They 're very good . phd b: Oh , yeah . phd c: It would {disfmarker} you know , it would real really mean that we should do short meetings when you {vocalsound} turn off the {disfmarker} {comment} turn off the air conditioning , grad a: Carbon monoxide poisoning ? undergrad d: Short meetings , that 's right . Or {disfmarker} Yeah , sort of {comment} r r phd c: got to finish this meeting . undergrad d: Tear t {pause} Tear your clothing off to stay cool . phd c: That 's right . undergrad d: Actually , the a th air {disfmarker} the air conditioning 's still working , that 's just an auxiliary fan . phd c: Right , I see . grad a: So phd c: So , um , in addition to this issue about the UW stuff there was announced today , uh , via the LDC , um , a corpus from I believe Santa Barbara . postdoc e: Yeah , I saw it . I 've been watching for that corpus . phd c: Um , of general spoken English . postdoc e: Yeah . Yep . phd c: And I don't know exactly how they recorded it but apparently there 's a lot of different {vocalsound} styles of speech and what not . grad a: Mm - hmm . phd c: And {disfmarker} postdoc e: They had people come in to a certain degree and they {disfmarker} and they have DAT recorders . phd c: I see . So it is sort of far field stuff . Right ? postdoc e: I {disfmarker} I assume so , actually , I hadn't thought about that . Unless they added close field later on but , um , I 've listened to some of those data and I , um , I 've been {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I was actually on the advisory board for when they set the project up . grad a: Mm - hmm . phd c: Oh , OK . phd b: What 's it sound like ? postdoc e: I 'm glad to see that it got released . grad a: Yeah , I {disfmarker} I wish {disfmarker} postdoc e: So it it 's a very nice thing . grad a: I wish we had someone here working on adaptation phd c: S grad a: because it would nice to be able to take that stuff and adapt it to a meeting setting . You know {disfmarker} phd c: But it may be {disfmarker} it may be useful in {disfmarker} postdoc e: How do you mean {disfmarker} do you mean mechanical adaptation or {disfmarker} grad a: No , software , to adapt the speech recognition . postdoc e: OK . phd c: Well , what I was thinking is it may be useful in transcribing , if it 's far field stuff , grad a: Mm - hmm . phd c: right ? In doing , um , some of our first automatic speech recognition models , it may be useful to have that kind of data postdoc e: Great idea . phd c: because that 's very different than any kind of data that we have so far . grad a: That 's true . postdoc e: And {disfmarker} and their recording conditions are really clean . I mean , I 've {disfmarker} I 've heard {disfmarker} I 've listened to the data . grad a: Well that 's not good , right ? phd c: That 's {disfmarker} that 's not great . postdoc e: It sounds {disfmarker} undergrad d: Tr postdoc e: well but what I mean is that , um {disfmarker} undergrad d: But far field means great distance ? I mean {disfmarker} grad a: Just these . undergrad d: Not head mounted ? phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: And so that 's why they 're getting away with just two channels or something , or are they using multiple DATs ? postdoc e: Um , oh , good question and I can't ans answer it . grad a: Well we can look into it . postdoc e: I don't know . phd c: No , and their web {disfmarker} their web page didn't answer it either . So I 'm , I uh , was thinking that we should contact them . postdoc e: OK . phd c: So it 's {disfmarker} that 's sort of a beside - the - point point . But . grad a: So we can get that just with , uh , media costs , undergrad d: Still a point . phd c: Right . grad a: is that right ? phd c: Uh , in fact we get it for free grad a: Oh . phd c: cuz they 're distributing it through the LDC . grad a: Great . postdoc e: Yep . grad a: So that would be {disfmarker} yeah , that would be something to look into . So . phd c: So , I can {disfmarker} I can actually arrange for it to arrive in short order if we 're {disfmarker} postdoc e: The other thing too is from {disfmarker} from a {disfmarker} grad a: Well , it 's silly to do unless we 're gonna have someone to work on it , so maybe we need to think about it a little bit . phd c: Huh . postdoc e: The other thing too is that their their jus their transcription format is really nice and simple in {disfmarker} in the discourse domain . But they also mentioned that they have it time aligned . I mean , I s I {disfmarker} I saw that write - up . phd c: Yeah . Maybe we should {disfmarker} maybe we should get a copy of it just to see what they did phd b: Yeah , absolutely . grad a: Yeah . phd c: so {disfmarker} so that we can {disfmarker} we can compare . postdoc e: It 's very nice . grad a: OK , why don't you go ahead and do that then Eric ? phd b: Absolutely . phd c: Alright , I 'll do that . I can't remember the name of the corpus . It 's Corps - S {disfmarker} postdoc e: CSAE . phd c: S {disfmarker} postdoc e: Corpus of Spoken American English . phd c: Right , OK . postdoc e: Yeah , sp I 've been {disfmarker} I was really pleased to see that . I knew that they {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they had had some funding problems in completing it phd b: Uh - huh . phd c: Yeah . postdoc e: but , um , phd c: Well they 're {disfmarker} postdoc e: this is clever . phd c: Apparently this was like phase one postdoc e: Got it through the LDC . phd c: and the there 's still more that they 're gonna do apparently or something like that unless of course they have funding issues postdoc e: Great . Great . phd c: and then then it ma they may not do phase two but {vocalsound} from all the web documentation it looked like , " oh , this is phase one " , whatever that means . postdoc e: Super . Super . Great . Yeah , that {disfmarker} I mean , they 're really well respected in the linguistics d side too and the discourse area , phd c: OK . postdoc e: and {disfmarker} So this is a very good corpus . phd c: But , it uh it would also maybe help be helpful for Liz , if she wanted to start working on some discourse issues , you know , looking at some of this data and then , grad a: Right . phd c: you know {disfmarker} So when she gets here maybe that might be a good thing for her . grad a: Actually , that 's another thing I was thinking about is that maybe Jane should talk to Liz , to see if there are any transcription issues related to discourse that she needs to get marked . postdoc e: OK . phd c: Maybe we should have a big meeting meeting . phd b: Sure , of course . undergrad d: That would be a meeting meeting meeting ? grad a: A meeting meeting meeting . phd c: Yeah . grad a: Well this is the meeting about the meeting meeting meeting . So . phd c: Oh . grad a: Um . phd c: Right . But maybe we should , uh find some day that Liz {disfmarker} uh , Liz and Andreas seem to be around more often . grad a: Mm - hmm . phd c: So maybe we should find a day when they 're gonna be here and {disfmarker} and Morgan 's gonna be here , and we can meet , at least this subgroup . I mean , not necessarily have the U - dub people down . grad a: Well , I was even thinking that maybe we need to at least ping the U - dub {disfmarker} to see {disfmarker} phd c: We need {disfmarker} we need to talk to them some more . grad a: you know , say " this is what we 're thinking about for our transcription " , if nothing else . So , well w shall we move on and talk a little bit about transcription then ? phd b: Mm - hmm . Let 's . phd c: Yeah . grad a: OK , so {comment} {vocalsound} since that 's what we 're talking about . What we 're using right now is a tool , um , from this French group , called " Transcriber " that seems to work very well . Um , so it has a , uh , nice useful Tcl - TK user interface and , uh , undergrad d: Thi - this is the process of converting audio to text ? grad a: Right . undergrad d: And this requires humans just like the {disfmarker} the STP stuff . grad a: Yes , yeah . Right , right . So we 're {disfmarker} we 're at this point only looking for word level . So all {disfmarker} all {disfmarker} so what you have to do is just identify a segment of speech in time , and then write down what was said within it , and identify the speaker . And so the things we {disfmarker} that we know {disfmarker} that I know I want are {vocalsound} the text , the start and end , and the speaker . But other people are interested in for example stress marking . And so Jane is doing primary stress , {vocalsound} um , stress marks as well . Um , and then things like repairs , and false starts , and , {vocalsound} filled pauses , and all that other sort of stuff , {vocalsound} we have to decide how much of that we wanna do . postdoc e: I did include a glo {comment} uh , a certain first pass . My {disfmarker} my view on it was when you have a repair {vocalsound} then , uh {disfmarker} it seems {disfmarker} I mean , we saw , there was this presentation in the {disfmarker} one of the speech group meetings about how {disfmarker} grad a: Mm - hmm . postdoc e: and I think Liz has done some stuff too on that , that it , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that you get it bracketed in terms of like {disfmarker} well , if it 's parenthetical , which I know that Liz has worked on , then {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} y y you 'll have different prosodic aspects . grad a: Mm - hmm . phd b: Hmm . postdoc e: And then also {vocalsound} if it 's a r if it 's a repair where they 're {disfmarker} like what I just did , {vocalsound} then it 's nice to have sort of a sense of the continuity of the utterance , the start to be to the finish . And , uh , it 's a little bit deceptive if you include the repai the pre - repair part {disfmarker} and sometimes or of it 's in the middle . Anyway , {vocalsound} so what I was doing was bracketing them to indicate that they were repairs which isn't uh , very time - consuming . grad a: Mm - hmm . undergrad d: I is there already some sort of plan in place for how this gonna be staffed or done ? Or is it real {disfmarker} is that what we 're talking about here ? grad a: Well , that 's part of the thing we 're talking about . So what we wanted to do was have Jane do basically one meeting 's worth , you know , forty minutes to an hour , postdoc e: Mm - hmm . grad a: and {disfmarker} postdoc e: As a pilot study . undergrad d: Yourself ? grad a: Yeah . undergrad d: It {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} this is like five times real time or ten times real time {disfmarker} postdoc e: Yeah , as a pilot study . grad a: Ten times about , is {disfmarker} and so one of the things was to get an estimate of how long it would take , and then also what tools we would use . And so the next decision which has to be made actually pretty soon is how are we gonna do it ? So . undergrad d: And so you make Jane do the first one so then she can decide , oh , we don't need all this stuff , just the words are fine . postdoc e: That 's right , that 's right . phd b: That 's right . postdoc e: I wanna hear about these {disfmarker} uh , we have a g you were s continuing with the transcription conventions for s grad a: R right , so {disfmarker} so one {disfmarker} one option is to get linguistics grad students and undergrads to do it . And apparently that 's happened in the past . And I think that 's probably the right way to do it . Um , it will require a post pass , I mean people will have to look at it more than once to make sure that it 's been done correctly , but I just can't imagine that we 're gonna get anything that much better from a commercial one . And the commercial ones I 'm sure will be much more expensive . undergrad d: Can't we get Joy to do it all ? grad a: Yeah right . postdoc e: No , {vocalsound} that 's {disfmarker} grad a: We will just get Joy and Jane to do everything . undergrad d: Is tha wasn't that what she was doing before ? Yeah , that 's right . grad a: But , you know , that 's what we 're talking about is getting some slaves who {disfmarker} who need money undergrad d: Right . grad a: and , uh , duh , again o postdoc e: I object to that characterization ! phd b: Oh , really . grad a: I meant Joy . And so again , I have to say " are we recording " postdoc e: Oh , thank you . OK . grad a: and then say , uh , Morgan has {disfmarker} has consistently resisted telling me how much money we have . undergrad d: Right . Well , the answer is zero . grad a: So . undergrad d: There 's a reason why he 's resisted . grad a: Well , if it 's zero then we can't do any transcription . undergrad d: But . grad a: I mean , cuz we 're {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} undergrad d: Right . phd b: I have such a hard name . grad a: I mean , I {disfmarker} I can't imagine us doing it ourselves . Right ? undergrad d: Well , we already {disfmarker} we already {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We already have a plan in place for the first meeting . grad a: N right . undergrad d: Right ? That 's {disfmarker} postdoc e: Well th there is als Yeah , really . There is also the o other possibility which is if you can provide not money but instructional experience or some other perks , {vocalsound} you can {disfmarker} you could get people to {disfmarker} to um , to do it in exchange . grad a: Right . undergrad d: Well , i b but seriously , I {disfmarker} I mean , Morgan 's obviously in a bind over this and thing to do is just the field of dreams theory , which is we we go ahead as though there will be money at the time that we need the money . grad a: Mm - hmm . phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: And that 's {disfmarker} that 's the best we can do . grad a: Right . phd b: Right . undergrad d: i b To not do anything until we get money is {disfmarker} is ridiculous . grad a: Right . undergrad d: We 're not gonna do any {disfmarker} get anything done if we do that . postdoc e: Mm - hmm . phd b: Yeah . grad a: So at any rate , Jane was looking into the possibility of getting students , at {disfmarker} is that right ? Talking to people about that ? postdoc e: I 'm afraid I haven't made any progress in that front yet . grad a: OK . postdoc e: I should 've sent email and I haven't yet . grad a: Yeah , right . So , uh {disfmarker} undergrad d: I d do {disfmarker} So until you actually {vocalsound} have a little experience with what this {disfmarker} this French thing does we don't even have {disfmarker} postdoc e: And I do have {disfmarker} grad a: She 's already done quite a bit . undergrad d: Oh , we have . postdoc e: I have {disfmarker} a bunch of hours , grad a: Yeah . undergrad d: I 'm sorry . So that 's where you came up with the f the ten X number ? postdoc e: yeah . undergrad d: Or is that really just a guess ? postdoc e: Actually that 's the {disfmarker} the one people usually use , ten X . phd c: How fast are you ? postdoc e: And I haven't really calculated {disfmarker} How fast am I ? undergrad d: Yeah i postdoc e: I haven't done a s see , I 've been at the same time doing kind of a boot strapping in deciding on the transcription conventions that {disfmarker} that are {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know , and {disfmarker} and stuff like , you know , how much {disfmarker} phd b: Mmm . phd c: Right . postdoc e: There 's some interesting human factors problems like , {vocalsound} yeah , what span of {disfmarker} of time is it useful to segment the thing into in order to uh , transcribe it the most quickly . phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: Cuz then , you know , you get like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you get a span of five words , that 's easy . phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: But then you have to take the time to mark it . And then there 's the issue of {vocalsound} it 's easier to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} hear it th right the first time if you 've marked it at a boundary instead of {vocalsound} somewhere in the middle , phd b: Mm - hmm . postdoc e: cuz then the word 's bisected or whatever and {disfmarker} And so I mean , I 've been sort of playing with , uh , different ways of mar cuz I 'm thinking , you know , I mean , if you could get optimal instructions you could cut back on the number of hours it would take . phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: D does uh {disfmarker} this tool you 're using is strictly {disfmarker} it doesn't do any speech recognition does it ? grad a: No . postdoc e: No , it doesn't but what a super tool . It 's a great environment . undergrad d: But {disfmarker} but is there anyway to {disfmarker} to wire a speech recognizer up to it and actually run it through {disfmarker} postdoc e: That 's an interesting idea . grad a: We 've {disfmarker} we 've thought about doing that postdoc e: Hey ! grad a: but the recognition quality is gonna be horrendous . undergrad d: Well , a couple things . phd b: Wow . undergrad d: First of all the time marking you 'd get {disfmarker} you could get by a tool . phd b: That 's true . undergrad d: And so if the {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if the issue really postdoc e: That 's interesting . undergrad d: uh , I 'm think about the close caption that you see running by on {disfmarker} on live news casts . grad a: Most of those are done by a person . undergrad d: You know , yo I know {disfmarker} I know that . postdoc e: Yeah , I undergrad d: No , I understand . And {disfmarker} in a lot of them you see typos and things like that , grad a: Mm - hmm . undergrad d: but it {disfmarker} but it occurs to me that {vocalsound} it may be a lot easier to correct things than it is to do things from scratch , no matter how wonderful the tool is . grad a: Yeah . Yeah , we {disfmarker} undergrad d: But if {disfmarker} if there was a way to merge the two {disfmarker} phd c: Well , I mean , but sometimes it 's easier to type out something instead of going through and figuring out which is the right {disfmarker} grad a: I mean , we 've talked about it postdoc e: That 'd be fun . grad a: but {disfmarker} phd c: I mean , it depends on the error rate , right ? undergrad d: Well s but {disfmarker} but again the timing is for fr should be for free . The timing should be {disfmarker} phd c: But we don't care about the timing of the words . undergrad d: Well I thought you just {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} said that was a critical issue . grad a: We don't care about the timing of the words , just of the utterances . postdoc e: No , uh the {disfmarker} the boundary {disfmarker} phd c: We cut it s s phd b: We don't {disfmarker} we don't know , actually . postdoc e: boundary . phd b: We haven't decided which {disfmarker} which time we care about , and that 's kind of one of the things that you 're saying , is like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you have the option to put in more or less timing data {disfmarker} and , uh , be in the absence of more specific instructions , {vocalsound} we 're trying to figure out what the most convenient thing to do is . grad a: Yeah , so {disfmarker} so what {disfmarker} what she 's done so far , is sort of {disfmarker} more or less breath g not breath groups , {comment} sort of phrases , continuous phrases . phd b: Yeah . grad a: And so , um , that 's nice because you {disfmarker} you separate when you do an extract , you get a little silence on either end . So that seems to work really well . postdoc e: That 's ideal . grad a: Um . phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: Although I was {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} you know , the alternative , which I was sort of experimenting with before I ran out of time , {vocalsound} recently was , {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that , you know , ev if it were like an arbitrary segment of time {disfmarker} i t pre - marked cuz it does take time to put those markings in . phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: It 's really the i the interface is wonderful because , you know , the time it takes is you listen to it , {vocalsound} and then you press the return key . But then , you know , it 's like , {vocalsound} uh , you press the tab key to stop the flow and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and , uh , the return key to p to put in a marking of the boundary . But , you know , obviously there 's a lag between when you hear it and when you can press the return key phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: so it 's slightly delayed , so then you {disfmarker} you listen to it a second time and move it over to here . undergrad d: a postdoc e: So that takes time . undergrad d: i a postdoc e: Now if it could all be pre - marked at some , {vocalsound} l you know , good {disfmarker} undergrad d: ar but grad a: Hmm . undergrad d: Are {disfmarker} are those d delays adjustable ? Those delays adjustable ? See a lot of people who actually build stuff with human computer interfaces {vocalsound} understand that delay , phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: and {disfmarker} and so when you {disfmarker} by the time you click it it 'll be right on because it 'll go back in time to put the {disfmarker} postdoc e: Yeah . phd b: It could do that postdoc e: Yeah , uh , not in this case . grad a: We could program that pretty easily , phd b: couldn't it . postdoc e: It has other {disfmarker} grad a: couldn't we Dan ? Yeah , mis Mister TCL ? phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: Oh , interesting point . phd b: I would have thought so , yeah . postdoc e: Ah ! {comment} Interesting point . phd b: Mmm . postdoc e: OK , that would make a difference . grad a: But , um {disfmarker} postdoc e: I mean , it 's not bad grad a: But , if we tried to do automatic speaker ID . postdoc e: but it does {disfmarker} take twice . grad a: I mean , cuz primarily the markings are at speaker change . phd b: Yeah , yeah , but {disfmarker} grad a: But that would be {disfmarker} phd b: But we 've got {disfmarker} we 've got the most channel data . We 'd have to do it from your signal . Right . I mean , we 've {disfmarker} we 've got {disfmarker} we 've got a lot of data . postdoc e: Oh , good point ! Ah ! grad a: Yeah , I guess the question is how much time will it really save us versus the time to write all the tools to do it . postdoc e: We 've got volume . phd b: Right . but the chances are if we if we 're talking about collecting {vocalsound} ten or a hundred hours , which is going to take a hundred or a thousand hours to transcribe {disfmarker} undergrad d: If {disfmarker} grad a: But {disfmarker} undergrad d: if we can go from ten X to five X we 're doing a big {disfmarker} grad a: We 're gonna need {disfmarker} we 're gonna need ten to a hundred hours to train the tools , and validate the tools the do the d to {disfmarker} to do all this anyway . phd c: Right . So maybe {disfmarker} postdoc e: Wow . phd b: If we 're just doing silence detection {disfmarker} postdoc e: But {disfmarker} but it op grad a: I knew you were gonna do that . Just saw it coming . postdoc e: I 'm sorry . I wish you had told me {disfmarker} wish you 'd told me . undergrad d: Put {disfmarker} put it on your sweater . postdoc e: At what part ? OK , I 'm alright . phd b: Um , i it seems like {disfmarker} Well , uh , I don't know . Yeah . I mean , it {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's maybe like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a week 's work to get to do something like this . So forty or fifty hours . phd c: Right . postdoc e: Could you get it so that with {disfmarker} so it would {disfmarker} it would detect volume on a channel and insert a marker ? And the {disfmarker} the format 's really transparent . phd b: Sure . phd c: Yeah . postdoc e: It 's just a matter of {vocalsound} a very c clear {disfmarker} it 's XML , isn't it ? grad a: Mm - hmm . postdoc e: It 's very {disfmarker} I mean , I looked at the {disfmarker} the file format and it 's just {disfmarker} it has a t a time {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a time indication and then something or other , and then an end time or something or other . phd c: So maybe {disfmarker} maybe we could try the following experiment . Take the data that you 've already transcribed postdoc e: Mm - hmm . phd c: and {disfmarker} undergrad d: Is this already in the past or already in the future ? phd c: Already in the past . undergrad d: You 've already {disfmarker} you 've already done some ? grad a: She 's {disfmarker} she 's done about half a meeting . phd c: She {disfmarker} she 's done one {disfmarker} she 's one {disfmarker} postdoc e: Yes I have . undergrad d: Oh - Oh , I see . phd c: Right . undergrad d: OK , grad a: Right ? phd c: Right . undergrad d: good . grad a: About half ? phd c: I 'm go postdoc e: S I 'm not sure if it 's that 's much but anyway , enough to work with . phd c: Right . phd b: Several minutes . phd c: Um , and {disfmarker} and throw out the words , but keep the time markings . And then go through {disfmarker} I mean , and go through and {disfmarker} and try and re - transcribe it , given that we had perfect boundary detection . postdoc e: OK . Good idea . phd c: And see if it {disfmarker} see if it {disfmarker} see if it feels easier to you . postdoc e: OK . undergrad d: And forgetting all the words because you 've been thr postdoc e: Yeah , that 's what I was thinking . I 'd {disfmarker} I 'd be cheating a little bit g with familiarity effect . phd c: Yeah , I mean uh , that 's part of the problem is , is that what we really need is somebody else to come along . phd b: Well , no , you should do it {disfmarker} you should do it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Do it again from scratch and then do it again at the boundaries . So you do the whole thing three times and then we get {disfmarker} phd c: Yeah . postdoc e: No . Now , there 's a plan . undergrad d: And then {disfmarker} then w since we need some statistics do it three more . postdoc e: OK . undergrad d: And so you 'll get {disfmarker} you 'll get down to one point two X by the time you get done . postdoc e: Oh , yeah . I 'll do that tomorrow . I should have it finished by the end of the day . undergrad d: No , but the thing is the fact that she 's {disfmarker} she 's did it before just might give a lower bound . That 's all . phd b: Yeah . phd c: Right . undergrad d: Uh , which is fine . postdoc e: Exactly . undergrad d: It 's {disfmarker} And if the lower bound is nine X then w it 's a waste of time . postdoc e: Yeah . phd c: Right . postdoc e: Well , uh but there 's an extra problem which is that I didn't really keep accurate {disfmarker} phd b: Oh ! postdoc e: uh , it wasn't a pure task the first time , phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , it 's gonna be an upper bound in {disfmarker} in that case . And it 's not really strictly comparable . So I think though it 's a good proposal to be used on a new {disfmarker} a new batch of text that I haven't yet done yet in the same meeting . Could use it on the next segment of the text . phd b: The point we {disfmarker} where do we get the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the oracle boundaries from ? phd c: Right . phd b: Or the boundaries . grad a: Yeah , one person would have to assign the boundaries and the {disfmarker} and the other person would have to {disfmarker} postdoc e: Well , but couldn't I do it for the next {disfmarker} phd b: We {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we could get fake {disfmarker} grad a: I mean that 's easy enough . postdoc e: Oh , I see what you mean . grad a: I could do that . postdoc e: Well , but the oracle boundaries would come from volume on a partic specific channel wouldn't they ? grad a: No , no . phd b: That would be the automatic boundaries . phd c: No , no , no , no . You wanna know {disfmarker} given {disfmarker} Given a perfect human segmentation , I mean , you wanna know how well {disfmarker} postdoc e: Yeah . phd c: I mean , the {disfmarker} the question is , is it worth giving you the segmentation ? postdoc e: Oh , I see what you mean . grad a: I mean , that {disfmarker} that 's easy enough . phd c: Right . postdoc e: Yeah . grad a: I could generate the segmentation and {disfmarker} and you could do the words , and time yourself on it . So . undergrad d: A little double - blind - ear kind of thing . grad a: Yep . postdoc e: I see . OK . grad a: So it {disfmarker} that might be worth doing . postdoc e: That 's good . I like that . grad a: That would at least tell us whether it 's worth spending a week or two trying to get a tool , that will compute the segmentations . phd c: Right . undergrad d: And the thing to keep in mind too about this tool , guys is that {vocalsound} sure , you can do the computation for what we 're gonna do in the future but if {disfmarker} if UW 's talking about doing two , or three , or five times as much stuff and they can use the same tool , then obviously there 's a real multiplier there . grad a: Right . postdoc e: And the other thing too is with {disfmarker} with speaker identification , if {disfmarker} if that could handle speaker identification that 's a big deal . phd b: Well it w phd c: Right . undergrad d: Well , use it . Yeah , that 's why we s bought the expensive microphones . postdoc e: OK . Yeah , I mean , that 's a nice feature . grad a: Yep . phd b: Yeah , yeah . postdoc e: That 's a major {disfmarker} that 's like , one of the two things that {disfmarker} phd c: I mean , there 's gonna {disfmarker} there 's gonna be {disfmarker} in the meeting , like the reading group meeting that we had the other day , that 's {disfmarker} it 's gonna be a bit of a problem phd b: OK . phd c: because , like , I wasn't wearing a microphone phd b: Yes . phd c: f and there were other people that weren't wearing microphones . grad a: That {disfmarker} undergrad d: But you didn't say anything worth while anyway , right ? grad a: That 'll s phd b: Right . phd c: That 's pretty much true postdoc e: Yeah . grad a: it might save ninety percent of the work though . phd c: but {disfmarker} but , yes . grad a: So . phd b: So I {disfmarker} I need to {disfmarker} we need to look at what {disfmarker} what the final output is but it seems like {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} it doesn't {disfmarker} it seems like it 's not really not that hard to have an automatic tool to generate {vocalsound} the phrase marks , and the speaker , and speaker identity without putting in the words . grad a: Yeah . I 've already become pretty familiar with the format , postdoc e: That 'd be so great . grad a: so it would be easy . phd b: Mm - hmm . postdoc e: Yeah . Yeah . grad a: If you 'd tell me where it is , huh ? postdoc e: We didn't finish the {disfmarker} the part of work already completed on this , did we ? I mean , you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you talked a little bit about the transcription conventions , grad a: Mm - hmm . postdoc e: and , I guess you 've mentioned in your progress report , or status report , that you had written a script to convert it into {disfmarker} So , {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} when I {disfmarker} i the {disfmarker} it 's quickest for me in terms of {vocalsound} the transcription part {vocalsound} to say {vocalsound} something like , you know , if {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if Adam spoke to , um {disfmarker} to just say , " A colon " , Like who could be , you know , I mean at the beginning of the line . phd b: Mmm . postdoc e: and E colon {vocalsound} instead of entering the interface for speaker identification and clicking on the thing , uh , indicating the speaker ID . So , and then he has a script that will convert it into the {disfmarker} the thing that , uh , would indicate speaker ID . grad a: It 's pretty cute . postdoc e: If that 's clear . phd c: OK . grad a: But at any rate . So , um , postdoc e: It 's Perl script . grad a: Right . So {disfmarker} so I think the guess at ten X seems to be pretty standard . Everyone {disfmarker} more or less everyone you talk to says about ten times for hard technical transcription . postdoc e: Mm - hmm . undergrad d: Using wh using stone age postdoc e: Yeah . undergrad d: using stone age tools . postdoc e: That 's right . grad a: Using {disfmarker} using stone age tools . I mean , I looked at Cyber Transcriber postdoc e: Yeah , well that 's true , but {disfmarker} grad a: which is a service that you send an audio file , they do a first - pass speech recognition . And then they {disfmarker} they do a clean up . But it 's gonna be horrible . They 're never gonna be able to do a meeting like this . phd b: No . undergrad d: Right . postdoc e: What {disfmarker} i just approximately , what did you find out in terms of price or {disfmarker} or whatever ? grad a: Well , for Cyber Transcriber they don't quote a price . They want you to call and {disfmarker} and talk . So for other services , um , they were about thirty dollars an hour . postdoc e: Of {disfmarker} of tape ? grad a: Thirty {disfmarker} So , yeah . postdoc e: Or of action ? grad a: For thirty dollars an hour for {disfmarker} of their work . postdoc e: OK . OK . Oh , of their {disfmarker} grad a: So {disfmarker} so if it 's ten times it 's three hundred dollars an hour . postdoc e: Oh ! phd c: So that 's three {disfmarker} that 's three hours . postdoc e: OK . undergrad d: D did you talk to anybody that does closed captioning for {disfmarker} for uh , TV ? phd c: Right . grad a: No . undergrad d: Cuz they a usually at the end of the show they 'll tell what the name of the company is , the captioning company that 's doing it . grad a: Mm - hmm . Yeah , so {disfmarker} so my {disfmarker} my search was pretty cursory . postdoc e: Interesting . grad a: It was just a net search . And , uh , so it was only people who have web pages and are doing stuff through that . undergrad d: Well , you know , the {disfmarker} the thing {disfmarker} the thing about this is thinking kind of , maybe a little more globally than I should here but {comment} {vocalsound} that really this could be a big contribution we could make . Uh , I mean , we 've been through the STP thing , we know what it {disfmarker} what it 's like to {disfmarker} to manage the {disfmarker} manage the process , and admittedly they might have been looking for more detail than what we 're looking for here but {vocalsound} it was a {disfmarker} it was a big hassle , right ? phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: I mean , uh , you know , they {disfmarker} they constantly could 've reminding people and going over it . And clearly some new stuff needs to be done here . And it 's {disfmarker} it 's only {vocalsound} our time , where " our " of course includes Dan , {vocalsound} Dan and you guys . It doesn't include me at all . Uh . j Just seems like {disfmarker} phd b: Yeah , I mean I don't know if we 'd be able to do any thing f to help STP type problems . But certainly for this problem we can do a lot better than {disfmarker} undergrad d: Bec Why ? Because they wanted a lot more detail ? grad a: Right . phd b: No . Because they had {disfmarker} because they only had two speakers , right ? I mean , the {disfmarker} the segmentation problem is {disfmarker} grad a: Trivial . undergrad d: Only had two . grad a: They had two speakers over the telephone . undergrad d: Oh , I see . So what took them so long ? grad a: Um , mostly because they were doing much lower level time . phd b: Yeah . grad a: So they were doing phone and syllable transcription , as well as , uh , word transcription . undergrad d: Right . Right . phd c: Right . postdoc e: Mm - hmm . grad a: And so we 're {disfmarker} w we decided early on that we were not gonna do that . undergrad d: I see . But there 's still the same issue of managing the process , of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of reviewing and keeping the files straight , and all this stuff , that {disfmarker} which is clearly a hassle . grad a: Yep . phd b: Yeah . grad a: Right . And so {disfmarker} so what I 'm saying is that if we hire an external service I think we can expect three hundred dollars an hour . phd b: Yeah . grad a: I think that 's the ball park . There were several different companies that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and the {disfmarker} the range was very tight for technical documents . Twenty - eight to thirty - two dollars an hour . phd c: And who who knows if they 're gonna be able to m manage multal multiple channel data ? phd b: Yeah , they won't . grad a: They won't . phd b: They w they 'll refuse to do it . grad a: We 'll have to mix them . postdoc e: Mm - hmm . phd b: Yeah . phd c: Right . phd b: No , but I mean , they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they won't {disfmarker} they won't {disfmarker} they will refuse to transcribe this kind of material . postdoc e: And then there 's the problem also that {disfmarker} phd b: That 's not what they 're d quoting for , right ? grad a: Yes , it is . undergrad d: Well , they might {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they might quote it {disfmarker} phd b: For quoting meetings ? grad a: Sev - several of them say that they 'll do meetings , and conferences , and s and so on . None of them specifically said that they would do speaker ID , or speaker change mark . phd b: Wow . Yeah . grad a: They all just said transcription . undergrad d: Th - th the th there may be just multiplier for five people costs twice as much and for ten people co {comment} Something like that . phd b: Yeah , yeah , yeah . grad a: Well , the {disfmarker} the way it worked is it {disfmarker} it was scaled . So what they had is , {vocalsound} if it 's an easy task it costs twenty - four dollars an hour and it will take maybe five or six times real time . And what they said is for the hardest tasks , bad acoustics , meeting settings , it 's thirty - two dollars an hour and it takes about ten times real time . So I think that we can count on that being about what they would do . phd b: I see . Yeah . grad a: It would probably be a little more phd b: Right . postdoc e: Yeah . grad a: because we 're gonna want them to do speaker marking . undergrad d: A lot of companies I 've worked for y the , uh {disfmarker} the person leading the meeting , the executive or whatever , would sort of go around the room and {disfmarker} and mentally calculate h how many dollars per hour this meeting was costing , grad a: So . undergrad d: right ? In university {vocalsound} atmosphere you get a little different thing . But you know , it 's a lot like , " he 's worth fifty an hour , he 's worth {disfmarker} " And so he so here we 're thinking , " well let 's see , if the meeting goes another hour it 's going to be another thousand dollars . " You know ? It 's {disfmarker} grad a: Yep , we have to have a short meeting . undergrad d: So ch {vocalsound} So every everybody ta Talk really fast . postdoc e: That 's very interesting . grad a: Stop talking ! phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: Let 's get it over with . postdoc e: Talk {vocalsound} slowly but with few words . grad a: And clearly . phd b: That 's right . undergrad d: And only talk when you 're pointed to . postdoc e: There you go . grad a: Content words only . postdoc e: We could have some telegraphic meetings . That might be interesting . phd b: Yeah , it 'd be cheap . undergrad d:  phd b: Cheap to transcribe . grad a: So . But at any rate , so we {disfmarker} we have a ballpark on how much it would cost if we send it out . undergrad d: And we 're talking about do doing how many hours worth of meetings ? grad a: Thirty or forty . undergrad d: So thirty or forty thousand dollars . phd b: Well , for ten thousand dollars . postdoc e: Yeah . phd c: So , meanwhile {disfmarker} undergrad d: Oh . What {disfmarker} Well , it was thirty times {disfmarker} phd b: Three hundred . grad a: Three hundred dollars an hour . undergrad d: Oh , I 'm sorry , three hundred . grad a: Right . undergrad d: Right , I w got an extra factor of three there . phd c: So it 's thirty dollars an hour , essentially , right ? undergrad d: Yeah . phd c: But we can pay a graduate student seven dollars an hour . And the question is what 's the difference {disfmarker} phd b: How {disfmarker} how much lower are they ? phd c: or ei eight dollars . What {disfmarker} do you know what the going rate is ? It 's {disfmarker} it 's {vocalsound} on the order of eight to ten . postdoc e: I think uh that would give us a {disfmarker} a good {disfmarker} good estimate . phd c: I think . But I 'm not sure . postdoc e: I 'd {disfmarker} I 'd say {disfmarker} phd b: Ten . postdoc e: yeah , I was gonna say eight {disfmarker} you 'd say ten ? phd c: Let 's say ten . phd b: Yeah , give them a break . phd c: Cuz it 's easier . undergrad d: The - these are not for engineering graduate students , right ? grad a: Right , these are linguistics grad students . Six . phd c: Yeah , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I don't know what the {disfmarker} I don't know what the standard {disfmarker} undergrad d: That 's right . phd c: but there is a standard pay scale grad a: Mm - hmm . phd c: I just don't know what it is . postdoc e: Yeah , that 's right . That 's right . phd c: Um , so that means that even if it takes them thirty times real time it 's cheaper to {disfmarker} to do graduate students . postdoc e: And there 's another aspect too . grad a: I mean , that 's why I said originally , that I couldn't imagine sending it out 's gonna be cheaper . phd b: No , it isn't . So . postdoc e: The other thing too is that , uh , if they were linguistics they 'd be {disfmarker} you know , in terms of like the post editing , i uh {disfmarker} tu uh content wise they might be easier to handle cuz they might get it more right the first time . grad a: And also we would have control of {disfmarker} I mean , we could give them feedback . Whereas if we do a service it 's gonna be limited amount . phd b: Yep , yep . postdoc e: Mmm . grad a: I mean , we can't tell them , you know , " for this meeting we really wanna mark stress postdoc e: Good point . phd b: Yep . grad a: and for this meeting we want {disfmarker} " phd b: No . postdoc e: Good point . grad a: And {disfmarker} and they 're not gonna provide {disfmarker} they 're not gonna provide stress , they 're not gonna re provide repairs , they 're not gonna {vocalsound} provide {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they may or may not provide speaker ID . So that we would have to do our own tools to do that . So {disfmarker} postdoc e: Mm - hmm . grad a: I just {disfmarker} phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: Just hypoth hypothetically assuming that {disfmarker} that we go ahead and ended up using graduate students . I who {disfmarker} who 's the person in charge ? Who 's gonna be the Steve here ? grad a: I hope it 's Jane . undergrad d: You ? grad a: Is that alright ? postdoc e: Oh , interesting . Um , now would this involve some manner of uh , monetary compensation or would I be the voluntary , uh , coordinator of multiple transcribers for checking ? grad a: Um , I would imagine there would be some monetary involved but we 'd have to talk to Morgan about it . phd b: Yeah , out of {disfmarker} out of Adam 's pocket . phd c: Yeah . postdoc e: OK . undergrad d: You know , it just means you have to stop working for Dave . See ? postdoc e: Oh , undergrad d: That 's why Dave should have been here . postdoc e: I don't wanna stop working for Dave . undergrad d: To pr protect his people . grad a: Well , I would like you to do it because you have a lot more experience than I do , postdoc e: Oh , cool . Yeah . grad a: but if {disfmarker} if that 's not feasible , I will do it with you as an advisor . postdoc e: Uh - huh . undergrad d: W we 'd like you to do it and we 'd like to pay you . postdoc e: We 'll see . phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: Not being Morgan though , it 's {disfmarker} postdoc e: OK . phd c: Right . postdoc e: Oh , I see . phd b: We 'd like to . Unfortunately {disfmarker} postdoc e: Well {disfmarker} undergrad d: Yeah . postdoc e: Yeah . grad a: Yeah , six dollars an hour . postdoc e: Yeah , I see . phd c: That 's a {disfmarker} undergrad d: And {disfmarker} and then {disfmarker} postdoc e: OK . Boy , if I wanted to increase my income I could start doing the transcribing again . phd b: Yeah , that 's right . Yeah . undergrad d: an an an and be and be sure and say , would you like fries with that when you 're thinking about your pay scale . postdoc e: I see . Good . Yeah , no , that {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would be interested in that {disfmarker} in becoming involved in the project in some aspect like that {disfmarker} grad a: OK . More . postdoc e: more . Yeah . Uh - huh . Yeah . grad a: Um , any more on transcript we wanna talk about ? phd b: What s so what are you {disfmarker} so you 've done some portion of the first meeting . And what 's your plan ? postdoc e: Yes . Mm - hmm . phd b: To carry on doing it ? postdoc e: What {disfmarker} Well , you know what I thought was right now we have p So I gave him the proposal for the transcription conventions . He made his , uh , suggestion of improvement . phd b: OK . postdoc e: The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} It 's a good suggestion . So as far as I 'm concerned those transcription conventions are fixed right now . And so my next plan would be {disfmarker} phd b: What {disfmarker} what do they {disfmarker} what do they cover ? postdoc e: They 're very minimal . So , {vocalsound} it would be good to {disfmarker} just to summarize that . So , um , {vocalsound} one of them is the idea of how to indicate speaker change , phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: and this is a way which meshes well with {disfmarker} with , uh , making it {vocalsound} so that , uh , you know , on the {disfmarker} At the {disfmarker} phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: Boy , it 's such a nice interface . When you {disfmarker} when you get the , um {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you get the speech signal you also get {vocalsound} down beneath it , {vocalsound} an indication of , {vocalsound} uh , if you have two speakers overlapping in a s in a single segment , you see them {vocalsound} one {disfmarker} displayed one above each other . And then at the same time {vocalsound} the top s part of the screen is the actual verbatim thing . You can clip {disfmarker} click on individual utterances and it 'll take you immediately to that part of the speech signal , and play it for you . And you can , eh you can work pretty well between those two {disfmarker} these two things . undergrad d: Is there a limit to the number of speakers ? grad a: Um , the user interface only allows two . And so if {disfmarker} if you 're using their interface to specify overlapping speakers you can only do two . phd b: Hmm . grad a: But my script can handle any . And their save format can handle any . And so , um , using this {disfmarker} the convention that Jane and I have discussed , you can have as many overlapping speakers as you want . undergrad d: Do y is this a , uh , university project ? phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: Th - this is the French software , right ? grad a: Yeah , French . phd b: Yeah , yeah , grad a: Yeah . And they 're {disfmarker} they 've been quite responsive . phd b: their academic . undergrad d: eh grad a: I 've been exchanging emails on various issues . phd b: Oh , really ? undergrad d: Uh , did you ask them to change the interface for more speakers ? postdoc e: Oh . grad a: Yes , and they said that 's on {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the works for the next version . undergrad d: Good . phd c: Oh , so multi multichannels . undergrad d: Good . grad a: Multichannels was also {disfmarker} Well , they said they wanted to do it but that the code is really very organized around single channels . So I think that 's n unlikely to ha happen . phd c: I see . OK . undergrad d: Do - do you know what they 're using it for ? Why 'd they develop it ? grad a: For this exact task ? phd c: For transcription . undergrad d: Are they linguists ? phd c: It 's {disfmarker} undergrad d: But I mean , are they {disfmarker} are they linguists or are they speech recognition people ? grad a: I think they 're linguists . postdoc e: Ho phd b: Linguists . postdoc e: Hmm . phd b: Yeah . phd c: They 're {disfmarker} they have some connection to the LDC cuz the LDC has been advising them on this process , the Linguistic Data Consortium . Um , undergrad d: Mm - hmm . phd c: so {disfmarker} but a apart from that . grad a: It 's also {disfmarker} All the source is available . phd c: Yeah . grad a: So . phd c: Right . grad a: If you {disfmarker} if you speak TCLTK . undergrad d: Great . Mm - hmm . grad a: And they have {disfmarker} they 've actually asked if we are willing to do any development and I said , well , maybe . phd c: Right . undergrad d: Good . grad a: So if we want {disfmarker} if we did {disfmarker} if we did something like programmed in a delay , which actually I think is a great idea , um , I 'm sure they would want that incorporated back in . postdoc e: Mm - hmm . Yeah , I do too . phd b: Mm - hmm . undergrad d: Their pre pre - lay . phd b: Pre - lay . grad a: Way . postdoc e: Pre - lay . Well , and they 've thought about things . You know , I mean , they {disfmarker} they do have {disfmarker} So you have {disfmarker} when you {disfmarker} when you play it back , um , it 's {disfmarker} it is useful to have , uh , a {disfmarker} a break mark to {disfmarker} se segment it . But it wouldn't be strictly necessary cuz you can use the {disfmarker} uh , the tabbed key to toggle {vocalsound} the sound on and off . I mean , it 'll stop the s speech you know if you if you press a tab . And , um . And so , uh , that 's a nice feature . And then also once you 've put a break in then you have the option of {vocalsound} cycling through the unit . You could do it like multiply until you get {comment} crazy and decide to stop cycling through that unit . undergrad d: Loop it ? Yo - you n you know , there 's al also the {disfmarker} the user interface that 's missing . postdoc e: Or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} undergrad d: It 's missing from all of our offices , and that is some sort of analog input for something like this . It 's what audio people actually use of course . It 's something that wh {vocalsound} when you move your hand further , the sound goes faster past it , like fast forward . You know , like a joy stick or a {disfmarker} uh , you could wire a mouse or trackball to do something like that . postdoc e: Why , that 's {disfmarker} That 's not something I wanted to have happen . undergrad d: No , but I 'm saying if this is what professionals who actually do this kind of thing for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} m for video or for audio {disfmarker} {vocalsound} where you {disfmarker} you need to do this , postdoc e: I see . Uh - huh . undergrad d: and so you get very good at sort of jostling back and forth , rather than hitting tab , and backspace , and carriage return , and enter , and things like that . phd b: Mmm . Mmm . postdoc e: Uh - huh . grad a: Yeah , we talked about things like foot pedals and other analog {disfmarker} phd c: Yeah . undergrad d: Mm - hmm . grad a: So {vocalsound} I mean , tho those are things we could do but I {disfmarker} I just don't know how much it 's worth doing . I mean we 're just gonna have {disfmarker} undergrad d: Ye - Yeah . phd c: Yeah . undergrad d: Right . postdoc e: Yeah , I {disfmarker} I agree . They {disfmarker} they have several options . So , uh , you know , I mentioned the looping option . Another option is it 'll pause when it reaches the end of the boundary . And then to get to the next boundary you just press tab grad a: Hmm . postdoc e: and it goes on to the next unit . undergrad d: Cool . postdoc e: I mean , it 's very nicely thought out . phd c: Hmm . postdoc e: They thought about {disfmarker} and also it 'll {vocalsound} go around the c the , uh , I wanna say cursor but I 'm not sure if that 's the right thing . grad a: Point , whatever . postdoc e: Anyway , you can {disfmarker} so they thought about different ways of having windows that you c uh work within , phd b: Mm - hmm . postdoc e: and {disfmarker} But so in terms of the con the conventions , then , {vocalsound} uh , basically , {vocalsound} uh , it 's strictly orthographic which means with some w provisions for , uh , w uh , {vocalsound} colloquial forms . So if a person said , " cuz " instead of " because " then I put a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} an apostrophe at the beginning of the word and then in {disfmarker} in double ang angle brackets what the full lexical item would be . phd b: Mm - hmm . postdoc e: And this could be {vocalsound} something that was handled by a table or something but I think {vocalsound} to have a convention marking it as a non - standard or wha I don't mean standard {disfmarker} but a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a non {vocalsound} uh , ortho orthographic , uh , whatever . phd b: Mm - hmm . grad a: Non - canonical . phd c: Mm - hmm . postdoc e: " Gonna " or " wanna " , you know , the same thing . And {disfmarker} and there would be limits to how much refinement you want in indicating something as non - standard pres pronunciation . phd c: How are you handling backchannels ? postdoc e: Backchannels ? grad a: Comments . postdoc e: Um , you know {disfmarker} oh , yes , there was some {disfmarker} in my view , when i when you 've got it densely overlapping , um , I didn't worry about {disfmarker} I didn't worry about s specific start times . phd c: What do you mean by du postdoc e: I sort of thought that this is not gonna be {comment} easily processed anyway and {vocalsound} maybe I shouldn't spend too much time getting exactly when the person said {vocalsound} " no " , or , you know , uh , i " immediate " . phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: And instead just sort of rendered " within this time slot , {vocalsound} there were two people speaking during part of it phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: and {vocalsound} if you want more detail , figure it out for yourself " , phd b: Mm - hmm . grad a: Well , I think what {disfmarker} w what Eric was talking about was channels other than the direct speech , phd c: I see . postdoc e: was sort of the way I felt @ @ {disfmarker} grad a: right ? phd c: Well , yeah , what I mean is wh I mean , when somebody says " uh - huh " in the middle of , uh , a @ @ {disfmarker} grad a: Yep . postdoc e: Uh - huh . That happened very seldom . phd c: Oh , cuz I was {disfmarker} I was listening to {disfmarker} Dan was agreeing a lot to things that you were saying as you were talking . undergrad d: Uh - huh . Uh - huh . postdoc e: Oh , well , thank you Dan . phd c: So . postdoc e: Appreciate it . Well , if it {disfmarker} if there was a word like " right " , you know , then I wou I would indicate {vocalsound} that it happened within the same tem time frame grad a: Yeah , there 's an overlapping mark . phd c: And {disfmarker} phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: but wouldn't say exactly when it happened . undergrad d: I 'll be right back . phd b: I transcribed a minute of this stuff phd c: I see . phd b: and there was a lot of overlapping . It was {disfmarker} postdoc e: A lot of overlapping , yeah . grad a: Well there there 's a lot of overlapping at the beginning and end . phd b: Yeah . Yeah . grad a: Huge amounts . phd b: It was at the beginning . grad a: Um , when {disfmarker} when no one i when we 're not actually in the meeting , {vocalsound} and we 're all sort of separated , and {disfmarker} and doing things . But even during the meeting there 's a lot of overlap but it {disfmarker} it 's marked pretty clearly . Um , some of the backchannel stuff Jane had some comments {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} but I think a lot of them were because you were at the meeting . And so I think that {disfmarker} that often {disfmarker} {vocalsound} often you can't tell . postdoc e: Yeah , well that 's true . That 's another issue . grad a: I mean , Jane had {disfmarker} had comments like uh , to {disfmarker} who {disfmarker} who the person was speaking to . phd c: Yeah . postdoc e: Yeah . phd b: Mm - hmm . postdoc e: Only when it was otherwise gonna be puzzling grad a: Yeah . postdoc e: because he was in the other room talking . grad a: Yeah , but someone who , uh , {vocalsound} was just the transcriber wouldn't have known that . postdoc e: Yeah . grad a: Or when Dan said , " I wa I wasn't talking to you " . phd c: Right . postdoc e: That 's true . I know . undergrad d: So you take a bathroom break in the middle and {disfmarker} and keep your head mount grad a: You have to turn off your mike . phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: Oh , you do ? phd b: You don't have to . postdoc e: Well he was so {disfmarker} so he was checking the meter levels and {disfmarker} and we were handling things while he was labeling the {disfmarker} the whatever it was , the PDA ? grad a: Mm - hmm . phd b: Uh - huh . postdoc e:  And {disfmarker} and so he was {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} sort of {disfmarker} you were sort of talking {disfmarker} you know , so I was saying , like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} " and I could label this one left . Right ? " And he {disfmarker} and he said , " I don't see anything " . And he said {disfmarker} {vocalsound} he said , {vocalsound} " I wasn't talking to you " . Or {disfmarker} it wasn't {disfmarker} it didn't sound quite that rude . grad a: But {disfmarker} postdoc e: But really , no , uh {disfmarker} w you know in the context if you know he can't hear what he 's saying {disfmarker} grad a: but when you w when you listen to it {disfmarker} undergrad d: he he It was a lot funnier if you were there though . postdoc e: Uh , yeah , grad a: Well what {disfmarker} what it {disfmarker} what happens is if you 're a transcriber listening to it it sounds like Dan is just being a total {disfmarker} {vocalsound} totally impolite . postdoc e: I know . Well , you 'll see . You can listen to it . Oh , I thought it was you who was . No , well , but you were {disfmarker} you were asking off the wall questions . grad a: Um {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} but if you knew that {disfmarker} that I wasn't actually in the room , and that Dan wasn't talking to me , it {disfmarker} it became OK . So . phd b: I see . undergrad d: So th postdoc e: And that 's w that 's where I added comments . phd c: Hmm . postdoc e: The rest of the time I didn't bother with who was talking to who but {disfmarker} but this was unusual circum circumstance . undergrad d: So this is {disfmarker} this is gonna go on the meeting meeting transcriber bloopers tape , right ? grad a: Yes . Right . postdoc e: Well and part of it was funny , uh {disfmarker} reason was because it was a mixed signal so you couldn't get any clues from volume {vocalsound} that , you know , he was really far away from this conversation . grad a: Stereo . Yeah . postdoc e: You couldn't do that symmetrically in any case . phd b: No . grad a: Oh . I should rewrite the mix tool to put half the people in one channel and half in the other . I have a {pause} auto - gain - mixer tool that mixes all the head mounted microphones into one signal postdoc e: That 's a good idea . undergrad d: Mm - hmm . grad a: and that seems to work really well for the uh {pause} transcribers . undergrad d: Great . postdoc e: But I thought it would be {disfmarker} you know , I {disfmarker} I didn't wanna add more contextual comments than were needed but that , it seemed to me , clarified that the con what was going on . And , uh {disfmarker} OK , phd c: So , s postdoc e: so normalization {disfmarker} phd c: I was just gonna ask , uh , so I just wanted to c sort of finish off the question I had about backchannels , phd b: Mmm . phd c: if that 's OK , postdoc e: Yeah . OK . phd c: which {disfmarker} which was , so say somebody 's talking for a while postdoc e: Yeah . phd c: and somebody goes " mm - hmm " in the middle of it , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and what not , does the conversation come out from the {disfmarker} or the person who 's speaking for the long time as one segment and then there 's this little tiny segment {vocalsound} of this other speaker or does it {disfmarker} does the fact that there 's a backchannel split the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} it in two . postdoc e: OK , my {disfmarker} my focus was to try and maintain conten con content continuity and , uh , to keep it within what he was saying . Like {vocalsound} I wouldn't say breath groups but prosodic or intonational groups as much as possible . So {vocalsound} if someone said " mm - hmm " in the middle of a {disfmarker} of someone 's , {vocalsound} uh , uh , intonational contour , {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I indicated it as , like what you just did . phd c: OK . postdoc e: then I indicated it as a segment which contained {vocalsound} @ @ {comment} this utterance plus an overlap . phd b: But that 's {disfmarker} but there 's only one {disfmarker} there 's only one time boundary for both speakers , phd c: OK . phd b: right ? postdoc e: Yeah , that 's right . And you know , it could be made more precise than that phd c: I see , postdoc e: but I just thought {disfmarker} phd c: I see , OK . postdoc e: Yeah . phd c: Right . undergrad d: I think whenever we use these speech words we should always {vocalsound} do the thing like you 're talking about , accent , postdoc e: Oh , I see what you mean . And then {pause} " hesitation " . Yeah . OK , and so then , uh , in terms of like words like " uh " and " um " I just wrote them because I figured there 's a limited number , and I keep them to a {disfmarker} uh , limited set because it didn't matter if it was " mmm " or " um " , {comment} {vocalsound} you know , versus " um " . So I just always wrote it as U M . phd b: OK . postdoc e: And " uh - huh " , you know , " UHUH . " I mean , like a s set of like five . But in any case {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I didn't mark those . phd b: No . phd c: Mm - hmm . phd b: " Uh - huh " is " U H H U H . " H U H . " postdoc e: I 'd be happy with that . That 'd be fine . It 'd be good to have that in the {disfmarker} in the conventions , what 's to be used . phd c: Huh - uh . grad a: I {disfmarker} I did notice that there were some segments that had pauses on the beginning and end . We should probably mark areas that have no speakers as no speaker . Then , so question mark colon is fine for that . postdoc e: Yeah , that 's a fine idea . That 's a fine idea . grad a: Just say silence . undergrad d: Well , what 's that mean ? postdoc e: Yeah , OK . Yeah . undergrad d: You mean re grad a: No one 's talking . undergrad d: ye s Oh . Silence all around . grad a: Yep . undergrad d: Yep . phd b: We have to mark those ? postdoc e: So I had {disfmarker} phd b: Don't they {disfmarker} d can't we just leave them unmarked ? postdoc e: I d Well , you see , that 's possible too . grad a: Well , I wanna leave the marked {disfmarker} I don't want them to be part of another utterance . So you just {disfmarker} you need to have the boundary at the start and the end . phd b: OK . Sure . postdoc e: Mm - hmm . Now that 's refinement that , uh , maybe it could be handled by part of the {disfmarker} part of the script or something more {disfmarker} phd b: Uh , yeah , it seems like {disfmarker} it seems like the , uh , tran the transcription problem would be very different if we had these {vocalsound} automatic speaker detection turn placing things . Because suddenly {disfmarker} I mean , I don't know , actually it sounds like there might be a problem {vocalsound} putting it into the software if the software only handles two parallel channels . But assuming we can get around that somehow . postdoc e: Mm - hmm . Well you were saying , I think it can read {disfmarker} grad a: It can read and write as many as you want , it 's just that it postdoc e: Uh - huh . phd b: But what if you wanna edit it ? Right ? I mean , the point is we 're gonna generate {vocalsound} this transcript with five {disfmarker} five tracks in it , but with no words . Someone 's gonna have to go in and type in the words . Um , and if there are five {disfmarker} five people speaking at once , grad a: Right , i it 's {disfmarker} I didn't explain it well . If we use the {disfmarker} the little {disfmarker} the conventions that Jane has established , I have a script that will convert from that convention to their saved convention . phd b: Oh , yeah . Yes . postdoc e: Which allows five . grad a: Right . postdoc e: And it can be m edited after the fact , grad a: Yes . postdoc e: can't it also ? But their {disfmarker} but their format , if you wanted to in indicate the speakers right there instead of doing it through this indirect route , {vocalsound} then i they {disfmarker} a c window comes up and it only allows you to enter two speakers . phd b: Yeah . Right . undergrad d: But you 're saying that by the time you call it back in to {disfmarker} from their saved format it opens up a window with window with five speakers ? postdoc e: So . But . grad a: Right . undergrad d: Oh ! That is sort of {pause} f grad a: It 's just user interface . undergrad d: They didn't quite go the whole {disfmarker} grad a: So i it 's {disfmarker} undergrad d: Yeah , they didn't go the whole route , grad a: the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the whole saved form the saved format and the internal format , all that stuff , handles multiple speakers . undergrad d: did they ? They just {disfmarker} grad a: It 's just there 's no user interface for specifying multiple {disfmarker} any more than two . undergrad d: Right . So your {disfmarker} your script solves {disfmarker} Doesn't it solve all our problems , postdoc e: And that {disfmarker} grad a: Yep . undergrad d: cuz we 're always gonna wanna go through this preprocessing {disfmarker} grad a: Yep . undergrad d: uh , assuming it works . grad a: Yep . postdoc e: And that works nicely cuz this so quick to enter . So I wouldn't wanna do it through the interface anyway adding which {disfmarker} worry who the speaker was . grad a: Yep . undergrad d: I see . Right . Good . postdoc e: And then , uh , let 's see what else . Oh , yes , I {disfmarker} I wanted to have {disfmarker} So sometimes a pers I {disfmarker} uh in terms of like the continuity of thought {vocalsound} for transcriptions , it 's {disfmarker} i it isn't just words coming out , it 's like there 's some purpose for an utterance . And {vocalsound} sometimes someone will {vocalsound} do a backchannel in the middle of it but you wanna show that it 's continued at a later point . So I have {disfmarker} I have a convention of putting like a dash {vocalsound} arrow just to indicate that this person 's utterance continues . And then when it uh , catches back up again then there 's an arrow dash , and then you have the opposite direction {vocalsound} to indicate continuation of ones own utterance versus , um , sometimes {vocalsound} we had the situation which is {disfmarker} you know , which you {disfmarker} which you get in conversations , {comment} of someone continuing someone else 's utterance , phd b: Mmm . postdoc e: and in that case I did a tilde arrow versus a arrow tilde , {vocalsound} to indicate that it was continuation but it wasn't {disfmarker} Oh , I guess I did {vocalsound} equal arrow for the {disfmarker} for the own {disfmarker} for yourself things phd b: Mm - hmm . postdoc e: cuz it 's {disfmarker} the speakers the same . And then tilde arrow if it was a different {disfmarker} if a different speaker , uh , con continuation . phd b: Mmm . grad a: Oh . postdoc e: But just , you know , the arrows showing continuation of a thought . phd b: Mm - hmm . postdoc e: And then you could track whether it was the same speaker or not by knowing {disfmarker} you know , at the end of this unit you 'd know what happened later . And that was like this person continued phd b: Mm - hmm . postdoc e: and you 'd be able to {vocalsound} look for the continuation . grad a: So phd b: But the only time that becomes ambiguous is if you have two speakers . Like , if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If you only have one person , if you only have one thought that 's continuing across a particular time boundary , you just need {vocalsound} one arrow at each end , and if it 's picked up by a different speaker , it 's picked up by a different speaker . The time it becomes ambiguous if you have more than one speaker and that {disfmarker} and they sort of swap . I guess if you have more than one thread going , then you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} then you need to know whether they were swapped or not . postdoc e: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . phd c: How often does that happen do you think ? postdoc e: Mm - hmm . phd b: Hopefully not very much . postdoc e: Yeah , I didn't use it very often . grad a: Especially for meetings . I mean , if i if you were just recording someone 's day , it would be impossible . You know , undergrad d: It l ou grad a: if you were trying to do a remembrance agent . But I think for meetings it 's probably alright . phd c: Hmm . grad a: But , a lot of these issues , I think that for {disfmarker} uh , from my point of view , where I just wanna do speech recognition and information retrieval , it doesn't really matter . phd b: Sure . grad a: But other people have other interests . phd b: I know . grad a: So . phd b: But it {disfmarker} it does feel {disfmarker} it does feel like it 's really in there . I {disfmarker} you know I did this {disfmarker} I did this transcription and I marked that , I marked it with ellipsis because it seemed like there was a difference . It 's something you wanted to indicate that it {disfmarker} that I {disfmarker} this was the end of the phrase , this was the end of {vocalsound} that particular transcript , but it was continued later . grad a: Right . phd b: And I picked up with an ellipsis . postdoc e: Excellent . Yeah . phd b: I didn't have the equal , not equal thing . postdoc e: Yeah . Well that 's {disfmarker} you know , I mean {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} that 's why I didn't {comment} I didn't do it n {vocalsound} I mean , that 's why I thought about it , and {disfmarker} and re - ev phd b: Yeah , yeah . postdoc e: and it didn't do {disfmarker} I didn't do it in ten times the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the time . grad a: Well , so anyway , are we interested then in writing tools to try to generate any of this stuff automatically ? postdoc e: Yeah . grad a: Is that something you want to do , Dan ? phd b: No . grad a: No . phd b: But it 's something @ @ that I feel we definitely ought to do . postdoc e: I also wanted to ask you if you have a time estimate on the part that you transcribed . Do you have a sense of how long {disfmarker} phd b: Yeah , it took me half an hour to transcribe a minute , but I didn't have any {disfmarker} I didn't even have a {disfmarker} postdoc e: OK . phd b: I was trying to get Transcriber to run but I couldn't . So I was doing it by typ typing into a text file and trying to fit {disfmarker} It was horrible . postdoc e: OK . OK . undergrad d: So thirty to one 's what you got ? phd b: Mm - hmm . undergrad d: So that 's a new upper limit ? phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: Well , I mean , that 's {disfmarker} that 's because you didn't have the segmentation help and all the other {disfmarker} grad a: But I think for a first try that 's about right . phd b: Is it {disfmarker} phd c: So {disfmarker} so if we hired a who if we hired a whole bunch of Dan 's {disfmarker} undergrad d: That 's right . postdoc e: Yeah . phd b: It was actually {disfmarker} it was quite {disfmarker} it was a t undergrad d: a grad a: If we {pause} hire an infinite number of Dan 's {disfmarker} phd b: it w undergrad d: It 'd b a a postdoc e: And there 's always a warm up thing of {disfmarker} grad a: Are we gonna run out of disk space by the way ? phd b: Yeah . grad a: OK , phd b: No . grad a: good . postdoc e: OK . undergrad d: d Doesn't it beep in the other room when you 're out of disk space ? phd c: So {disfmarker} Is there {disfmarker} grad a: No . phd c: Maybe we should s consider also , um , starting to build up a web site around all of these things . phd b: Web site ! That 's great ! phd c: I know . grad a: Dan 's sort of already started . phd b: We could have like business - to - business E - commerce as well ! phd c: That 's right . No , but I 'm it would be interesting {disfmarker} it would be interesting to see {disfmarker} grad a: Can we sell banner ads ? undergrad d: Get {disfmarker} get paid for click - throughs ? grad a: What a good idea , phd b: Yeah . grad a: that 's how we could pay for the transcription . phd c: I want to introduce {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I want to introduce the word " snot - head " into the conversation at this point . phd b: We can have {disfmarker} undergrad d: You wanna word that won't be recognized ? phd c: You see , cuz {disfmarker} uh , cuz {disfmarker} Exactly . Um . postdoc e: Oh , I don't think so . phd c: No . grad a: Hey , what about me ? phd c: The r w What {disfmarker} OK . postdoc e: You 're the one who raised the issue . phd c: No . Alright , see here 's {disfmarker} here 's {disfmarker} here 's my thought behind it which is that , uh , the {disfmarker} the stuff that you 've been describing , Jane , I gu one has to , {vocalsound} of course {vocalsound} indicate , {comment} {vocalsound} um , i is very interesting , postdoc e: Alright . phd c: and I I 'd like to be able to {disfmarker} to pore through , you know , the {disfmarker} the types of tr conventions that you 've come up with and stuff like that . phd b: Yeah , yeah , yeah . phd c: So I would like to see that kind of stuff on the web . postdoc e: OK , now , w the alternative to a web site would be to put it in Doctor speech . phd b: Yes . Yes . postdoc e: Cuz {disfmarker} cuz what I have is a soft link to my transcription {vocalsound} that I have on my account phd c: Either 's fine . phd b: We c postdoc e: but it doesn't matter . grad a: We can do it all . phd b: we can do it all ! We can write {disfmarker} postdoc e: OK . phd b: Oh . postdoc e: Web site 's nice . phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: Then you have to t you have to do an HT access . undergrad d: Web site 's what ? phd b: We could actually {disfmarker} maybe we could use the TCL plug - in . Oh , man . postdoc e: Ooo ! He 's committed himself to something . phd c: Ow . See he said the word TCL and {disfmarker} and that 's {disfmarker} undergrad d: But he does such a good job of it . He should be allowed to {disfmarker} to , you know , w do it . postdoc e: I know , I know . phd b: I know , but that {disfmarker} but , I {disfmarker} Right . But I should be allowed to but {disfmarker} undergrad d: If you just did a crappy job , {vocalsound} no nobody would want you to do it . phd b: I sh I shouldn't be allowed to by m by my own {disfmarker} {vocalsound} by my {disfmarker} according to my own priorities . Alright . Let 's look at it anyway . So definitely we should {disfmarker} we should have some kind of access to the data . grad a: And we have {disfmarker} we have quite a disparate number of web and other sorts of documents on this project sort of spread around . phd c: Yeah . grad a: I have several and Dan has a few , phd b: Yes . grad a: and {disfmarker} phd c: Right , so we can add in links and stuff like that to other things . postdoc e: Ah ! grad a: Yep . postdoc e: Nice . phd b: Well , yeah . phd c: The {disfmarker} phd b: Well so then th grad a: Try {disfmarker} try to s consolidate . I mean , who wants to do that though ? phd b: the other side is , yeah . phd c: Uh , right . grad a: No one wants to do that . So . postdoc e: Yeah . phd b: Right , that 's the problem . phd c: Well , we could put {disfmarker} we could put sort of a disorganized sort of group gestalt {disfmarker} undergrad d: Why ? What {disfmarker} what 's {disfmarker} what 's the issue ? phd b: No one owns the project . undergrad d: No one what ? phd b: No one owns the project . grad a: Yeah , I own the project but I don't wanna do it . phd b: No one wants to own the project . phd c: Right . undergrad d: W well {pause} Do {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} grad a: It 's mine ! All mine ! phd b: Well then you have to do the web site . undergrad d: But {disfmarker} grad a: " Wah - hah - hah - hah - hah - hah . " phd b: You know , it 's like , it 's that simple . undergrad d: b but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but what are you {disfmarker} what are you talking about for web site hacking ? phd b: No {disfmarker} undergrad d: You 're talking about writing HTML , right ? grad a: Yeah , I {disfmarker} I 'm talking about putting together all the data in a form that {disfmarker} that is legible , and pleasant to read , and up to date , and et cetera , et cetera , et cetera . phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: But , is it against the law to actually use a tool to help your job go easier ? grad a: Absolutely . It 's {disfmarker} it 's absolutely against the law to use a tool . I haven't found any tools that I like . undergrad d: You y grad a: It 's just as easy to use {disfmarker} to edit the raw HTML as anything else . undergrad d: No kidding ? phd b: That 's obviously not true , grad a: It 's obviously not true . phd b: but you have {disfmarker} undergrad d: No , it it it 's obviously true that he hasn't found any he likes . phd b: Right . That 's true . undergrad d: The question is what is {disfmarker} what 's he looked at . postdoc e: Which one do you use Jim ? undergrad d: I use something called Trellix . postdoc e: Oh , that 's right . I remember . Yeah . undergrad d: And it {disfmarker} postdoc e: Which produces also site maps . grad a: Now , I guess if I were {disfmarker} if I were doing more powerful {disfmarker} excuse me {disfmarker} more complex web sites I might want to . undergrad d: it 's - it it 's very powerful . grad a: But most of the web sites I do aren't that complex . postdoc e: Well , would this be to document it also for outside people or mainly for in house use ? grad a: But . I think both . phd c: No , I think in grad a: Mostly in house . phd b: That 's right . phd c: I think mostly internal . undergrad d: Well , yeah , postdoc e: OK . undergrad d: but what does internal mean ? phd b: No , both . undergrad d: I mean , you 're leaving . People at UW wanna look at it . I mean , it 's {disfmarker} it 's internal {comment} until {disfmarker} phd c: Right . Internal to the project . undergrad d: I see . postdoc e: We could do an HT access which would accommodate those things . phd b: I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} grad a: OK , well , send me links and I wi send me pointers , rather , and I 'll put it together . phd b: I 'm not {disfmarker} o postdoc e: Wonderful . phd b: OK . I 'm not sure how {disfmarker} how {vocalsound} important that distinction is . I don't think {vocalsound} we should say , {vocalsound} " oh , it 's internal therefore we don't have to make it very good " . I mean , you can say {vocalsound} " oh {disfmarker} oh , it 's internal phd c: No . No . phd b: therefore we can put data in it that we don't {disfmarker} we don't have to worry about releasing " . But I think the point is to try and {vocalsound} be coherent and make it a nice presentation . undergrad d: Right . I agree . postdoc e: Yeah , it is true , that is {disfmarker} it benefits to {disfmarker} undergrad d: Cuz you 're gonna have to wor do the work sooner or later . phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: That 's right . I mean , it 's the early on . undergrad d: Even if it 's just writing things up . grad a: Yep . undergrad d: You know ? postdoc e: It 's a great idea . grad a: OK , um , let 's move on to electronics . phd b: Ah . Great . undergrad d: d we {disfmarker} we out of tape {disfmarker} out of disk ? phd b: No , we 're doing {disfmarker} we 're doing great . undergrad d: I {disfmarker} I was looking for the actual box I plan to use , uh , but I {disfmarker} c all I could {disfmarker} I couldn't find it at the local store . But this is {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the technology . It 's actually a little bit thinner than this . And it 's two by two , by one , and it would fit right under the {disfmarker} right under th the the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the lip , grad a: Yeah , does everyone know about the lip on the table ? It 's great . undergrad d: yeah . There 's a lip in these tables . postdoc e: Nice . undergrad d: And , it oc I p especially brought the bottom along to try and generate some frequencies that you may not already have recorded . grad a: Clink ! Clink ! undergrad d: Let 's see {disfmarker} {vocalsound} see what it does to the {disfmarker} But this was the uh {disfmarker} just {disfmarker} just to review , and I also brought this {comment} along rather than the projector so we can put these on the table , and sort of w push them around . grad a: And {disfmarker} and crinkle them and {disfmarker} phd b: What ? postdoc e: And th " that " being a diagram . phd b: What ? undergrad d: That {disfmarker} that 's the six tables that we 're looking at . These six tables here , {vocalsound} with {disfmarker} with little boxes sort of , uh , in the middle here . phd b: I see . postdoc e: OK . undergrad d: Which es would {disfmarker} I mean , the {disfmarker} the boxes are pretty much out of the way anyway . I 'll - I 'll show you the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the cro this is the table cross section . I don't know if people realize what they 're looking at . phd b: You trying to {pause} screw up the m the microphones ? grad a: Yes . He is . Absolutely . phd b: I mean th undergrad d: Well why not ? I mean , cuz this is what 's gonna happen . You got plenty of data . I won't come to your next meeting . And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and you So this is the box 's {disfmarker} grad a: Get your paper off my PDA ! phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: Yeah , let {disfmarker} let the record show that this is exhibit two B . undergrad d: That 's right . " Or not to be " . Yeah , yeah . grad a: Yeah . undergrad d: Uh , the box , uh {disfmarker} there 's a half inch lip here . The box is an inch thick so it hangs down a half an inch . And so the {disfmarker} the two {vocalsound} head set jacks would be in the front and then the little LED to indicate that that box is live . The {disfmarker} the important issue about the LED is the fact that we 're talking about eight of these total , which would be sixteen channels . And , uh , even though we have sixteen channels back at the capture , they 're not all gonna be used for this . phd b: Hmm . undergrad d: So there 'd be a subset of them used for {disfmarker} obviously j just use the ones at this end for {disfmarker} {vocalsound} for this many . So {disfmarker} Excuse me . you 'd like a {disfmarker} a way to tell whether your box is live , so the LED wouldn't be on . phd b: Right . All the lights . undergrad d: So if you 're plugged in it doesn't work and the LED is off that 's {disfmarker} that 's a tip off . And then the , uh {disfmarker} would wire the {disfmarker} all of the cables in a {disfmarker} in a bundle come through here and o obviously collect these cables at the same time . postdoc e: That 's good . undergrad d: Uh , so this {disfmarker} this notion of putting down the P Z Ms {vocalsound} and taking them away would somehow have to be turned into leaving them on the table grad a: Right . Well , we wanna do that definitely . undergrad d: or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} Right . grad a: So . undergrad d: Right . And so the {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} we just epoxy them down or something . Big screw into the table . phd b: Velcro . undergrad d: Uh , and even though there 's eight cables they 're not really very big around so my model is to get a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a p piece of {disfmarker} grad a: Sleeve . undergrad d: yeah , that {disfmarker} that stuff that people put with the little {disfmarker} you slip the wires into that 's {vocalsound} sort of shaped like that cross section . grad a: Oh . OK , not just sleeve them all ? undergrad d: Yeah . I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm r a I 'm going up and then I 'm going down . grad a: And leave them loose ? phd b: No . postdoc e: That looks like a semi - circle . phd b: Yeah . It 's like a {disfmarker} it 's a sleeping policeman . grad a: Whoo ! phd b: Speed bump ! postdoc e: Sleeping pol phd b: Speed bump . grad a: Speed A " sleeping policeman " ! undergrad d: Yeah , it 's like a speed bum {vocalsound} An postdoc e: Speed bump . That 's good . There we go s grad a: Cool . undergrad d: And they 're ac they 're actually ext extruded from plastic . phd c: What is {disfmarker} undergrad d: They sorta look like this . grad a: Oh . phd c: What does that mean ? phd b: That 's the s that 's British for speed bump , phd c: Is it a speed bump ? undergrad d: So that the wires go through here . phd b: yeah . phd c: Wow . postdoc e: Oh , is that right ? phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: I never heard that . grad a: That 's really cruel . undergrad d: So . postdoc e: Ah ! grad a: OK , so that {disfmarker} undergrad d: s So it would c basically go on the diagonal here . phd c: It could go either way . grad a: So why do we have sixteen channels instead of like some fewer number ? phd b: Yeah . phd c: I guess . undergrad d: Uh , because the {disfmarker} phd b: How else are you gonna distribute them around the tables ? undergrad d: Because they 're there . grad a: Well , OK , let me rephrase that . Why two each ? phd b: Oh , because then you don't have to just have one each . So that if t if you have two people sitting next to each other they can actually go into the same box . undergrad d: Yeah . grad a: OK . undergrad d: And to {disfmarker} See , thi this is really the way people sit on this table . Th grad a: OK . postdoc e: Mm - hmm . undergrad d: Uh . Dot , dot , dot . postdoc e: Which means two at each station . undergrad d: Well that {disfmarker} that 's the way people sit . That 's how many chairs are in the room . postdoc e: Yeah . grad a: Alright . postdoc e: Yeah , I 'm just saying that for the recording . undergrad d: Yeah . grad a: Right . undergrad d: Right . grad a: OK . undergrad d: And certainly you could do a thing where all sixteen were plugged in . grad a: But then none of these . undergrad d: Uh if {disfmarker} if you ha if you had nothing else . grad a: Right . N none of these and no P Z Ms then . undergrad d: Yeah . Right . Right . I agree . phd b: Only if you had {disfmarker} Well it depends on this box , right ? undergrad d: Oh , true enough . And actually , at the m my plan is to only bring eight wires out of this box . phd b: Exactly . grad a: Oh , I didn't understand {disfmarker} undergrad d: This {disfmarker} this box {disfmarker} Thi - thi thi this box is a one off deal . postdoc e: That being the wiring box . grad a: Oh , I see , I see . undergrad d: Uh . And , uh , it 's function is to s to , uh , essentially a wire converter to go from these little blue wires to these black wires , plus supply power to the microphones cuz the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} he the , uh , cheap head mounteds all require low voltage . grad a: So {disfmarker} so you 'd imagine some sort of {disfmarker} in some sort of patch panel on top to figure out what the mapping was between each d of these two and each of those one or what ? phd b: Hmm ! undergrad d: Well I w I I the simplest thing I could imagine , i which is really , really simple is to {disfmarker} quite literally that these things plug in . And there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a plug on the end of each of these {disfmarker} these , uh , ei eight cables . postdoc e: What {disfmarker} phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: OK . Each of the blue wires ? phd b: But there are only four . undergrad d: An - and there 's only {disfmarker} there 's only four slots that are {disfmarker} you know , in {disfmarker} in the first version or the version we 're planning to {disfmarker} to build . postdoc e: Mm - hmm . phd b: Yeah . grad a: Mm - hmm . phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: So {vocalsound} that {disfmarker} that was the whole issue with the LED , that you plug it in , the LED comes on , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and you 're live . grad a: Oh , then it comes on . I see , I see . OK , good . undergrad d: Now the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the subtle issue here is that {disfmarker} tha I {disfmarker} I haven't really figured out a solution for this . So , we it 'll have to be convention . What happens if somebody unplugs this because they plug in more of something else ? grad a: Mm - hmm . undergrad d: Well the {disfmarker} there 's no clever way to let the up stream guys know that you 're really not being powered . So {disfmarker} th there will be a certain amount of looking at cables has to be done if people , uh , rewire things . grad a: Right . phd b: Yeah , I mean , we {disfmarker} I had that last time . undergrad d: But . phd b: But uh there are actually {disfmarker} that you know , there 's an extra {disfmarker} there 's a mix out on the radio receiver ? undergrad d: Mm - hmm . phd b: So there are actually six {vocalsound} XLR outs on the back of the radio receiver and only five cables going in , I had the wrong five , so I ended up {vocalsound} not recording one of the channels and recording the mix . undergrad d: How interesting . D did you do any recognition on the mix {disfmarker} mix out ? postdoc e: Hmm . phd b: No . undergrad d: Wonder whether it works any {disfmarker} phd b: But I subtracted the four that I did have from the mix and got a pretty good approximation of the @ @ . undergrad d: Got the fifth ? grad a: You g undergrad d: Cool . postdoc e: Oh , how great . grad a: And did it work ? phd b: Yeah . grad a: Did it sound good ? phd b: It 's not bad . undergrad d: Is it {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} phd b: It 's not bad , grad a: Wow . phd b: yeah . undergrad d: Ain't science wonderful ? postdoc e: That 's amazing . phd b: Yeah . grad a: So what 's the schedule on these things ? undergrad d: So {disfmarker} phd b: But , you always {disfmarker} postdoc e: Wow . undergrad d: Uh , well I was wrestling with th with literally the w number of connectors in the cable and the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the , uh , {vocalsound} powering system . And I {disfmarker} I was gonna do this very clever phantom power and I decided a couple days ago not to do it . phd b: Hmm ! undergrad d: So I 'm ready to build it . Which is to say , uh , the neighborhood of a week to get the circuit board done . grad a: Mm - hmm . So I think the other thing I 'd like to do is , do something about the set up phd b: See grad a: so that it 's a little more presentable and organized . undergrad d: I agree . grad a: And I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm just not sure what that is . I mean , some sort of cabinet . undergrad d: Well I can build a cabinet . The {disfmarker} the difficulty for this kind of project is the intellectual capital to design the cabinet . grad a: Mm - hmm . undergrad d: In other words , to figure out ex exactly what the right thing is . That cabinet can {disfmarker} can go away . We can use that for {disfmarker} for uh kindling or something . But if you can imagine what the right form factor is . Dan - Dan and I have sort of gone around on this , and we were thinking about something that opened up in the top {vocalsound} to allow access to the mixer for example . grad a: Mm - hmm . undergrad d: But there 's these things sticking out of the mixer which are kind of a pain , so you end up with this thing that {disfmarker} if if you stuck the mixer up here and the top opened , it 'd be {disfmarker} it 'd be fine . You wouldn't necessarily {disfmarker} Well , you s understand what I 'm {disfmarker} grad a: Yeah , I understand . phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} you can {disfmarker} you can start {disfmarker} start s sketching it out , grad a: So . undergrad d: and I can certainly build it out of oak no problem , would it {disfmarker} you know , arb you know , arbitrarily amount of {disfmarker} grad a: I need a desk at home too , alright ? Is that gonna be a better solution than just going out and buy one ? undergrad d: Well , the {disfmarker} as we found out with the {disfmarker} the thing that , uh , Jeff bought a long time ago to hold our stereo system {vocalsound} the stuff you buy is total crap . And I mean this is something you buy . grad a: Mm - hmm . undergrad d: And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} grad a: And it 's total crap . undergrad d: It 's total crap . Well , it 's useless for this function . Works fine for holding a Kleenex , grad a: Right , Kleenex and telephones . undergrad d: but it {disfmarker} Right . grad a: Um , so yeah , I g I guess it 's just a question , is that something you wanna spend your time on ? undergrad d: Oh , I {disfmarker} I 'm paid for . grad a: OK , great . undergrad d: I have no problem . No , but w certainly one of the issues is {disfmarker} is the , uh {disfmarker} is security . grad a: Hmm ? Mm - hmm . undergrad d: I mean , we 've been {disfmarker} been {disfmarker} been lax and lucky . grad a: Lax . phd b: Yeah . Yep . undergrad d: Really lucky with these things . But they 're not ours , so {disfmarker} phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: the , uh {disfmarker} the flat panels . phd b: Oh , yeah ! grad a: I 'm telling you , I 'm just gonna cart one of them away if they stay there much longer . phd b: Well w yeah , exactly . undergrad d: Uh , let the record show at {disfmarker} uh {vocalsound} at f four thirty - five {vocalsound} Adam Janin says {disfmarker} postdoc e: Wow . Tempting . phd b: We 'll know {disfmarker} we 'll know to come after . postdoc e: Tempting . Yeah . grad a: So , um , j uh , then the other question is do we wanna try to do a user interface that 's available out here ? phd b: Sorry ? undergrad d: Slipped {disfmarker} almost slipped it by Dan . postdoc e: Use - user interface {disfmarker} grad a: A user interface . I mean , do we wanna try to get a monitor ? Or just something . phd b: Oh ! Sure . postdoc e: Oh . phd b: Well of course we do . grad a: And how do we want to do that ? postdoc e: You mean like see {disfmarker} see meter readings , from {disfmarker} while sitting here . grad a: J just so we see something . postdoc e: Wow . undergrad d: How about use the thing that um ACIRI 's doing . phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: Which is to say just laptop with a wireless . phd b: Yeah , yeah , yeah . Sure . postdoc e: Oh . phd b: Which we 'll borrow from them , {vocalsound} when we need it . undergrad d: What 's wrong with yours ? If we bought you a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} phd b: Oh , a Applecard . Sure . Right . Yeah , you could use my machine . phd c: Well {disfmarker} undergrad d: What ? grad a: I have an IRAM machine I 've borrowed and we can use it . phd b: I {disfmarker} or the {disfmarker} undergrad d: N no , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm serious . Does {disfmarker} does the wireless thing work on your {disfmarker} grad a: Wait , isn't that an ethernet connection or is that a phone ? phd b: Uh , that 's an ethernet connection . grad a: Well {disfmarker} phd b: It 's going next door . undergrad d: Yeah {disfmarker} no {disfmarker} no I 'm a I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I ain't joking here . grad a: We jus undergrad d: I 'm serious , that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} phd b: Yeah . No , no , absolutely , that 's the right way to do it . T to have it uh , just {disfmarker} undergrad d: It 's very convenient especially if Dan happens to be sitting at that end of the table to not have to run down here and {disfmarker} and look in the thing every so often , phd b: Yeah . And given {disfmarker} given that we 've got a wireless {disfmarker} that we 've got a {disfmarker} we got the field . undergrad d: but just have the {disfmarker} It 's right there . phd b: Right . undergrad d: Right ? The antenna 's right there , grad a: Right . phd b: Yeah . Yeah . undergrad d: right outside the {disfmarker} phd b: I don't know . undergrad d: Y I mean , we need {disfmarker} obviously need to clear this with ACIRI but , uh , how tough can that be ? There {disfmarker} it you 'd {disfmarker} all you need 's web access , isn't it ? phd b: W we don't need X access undergrad d: In {disfmarker} in theory . phd b: but I mean that 's fine . That 's {disfmarker} that 's what it does , undergrad d: OK , phd b: yeah . undergrad d: great , great . grad a: Um , phd b: So {disfmarker} grad a: right , so it 's just a question of getting a laptop and a wireless modem . phd b: With a {disfmarker} with a {disfmarker} with a {disfmarker} w undergrad d: No , and he {disfmarker} he had , reque @ @ {disfmarker} my {disfmarker} my proposal is you have a laptop . phd b: No . Yeah . I do ! undergrad d: You don't ? phd b: Yeah . Yeah , yeah . undergrad d: If {disfmarker} if we bought you the thing would you mind using it with i the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} phd b: No , I would love to but I 'm not sure if my laptop is compatible with the wave LAN thing they 're using . undergrad d: Really ? grad a: To {pause} Mac . phd b: Well Apple has their own thing , right ? phd c: He 's {disfmarker} undergrad d: Your new one ? grad a: Airport . undergrad d: I 'm sorry ? phd b: Apple has their own thing . And {disfmarker} undergrad d: I thought it just came through a serial p or an Ethernet port . phd b: Yeah , I think what {disfmarker} I think you {disfmarker} I think it just plug plugs in a PC card , so you could probably make it run with that , but . grad a: The question is , is there an Apple driver ? undergrad d: I {disfmarker} e phd b: Yeah , I 'm sure . I imagine there is . But {disfmarker} uh anyway there are {disfmarker} there are abs there are a bunch of machines at ICSI that have those cards undergrad d: But the two t phd b: and so I think if w if it doesn't {disfmarker} we should be able to find a machine that does that . I {disfmarker} I mean I know that doesn't {disfmarker} don't {disfmarker} don't the important people have those little blue VAIOs that {disfmarker} undergrad d: Well , uh , b that {disfmarker} to me that 's a whole nother . That 's a whole nother issue . postdoc e: Hmm . Hmm . phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: The {disfmarker} the idea of con convincing them that we should use their network i is fairly straight forward . phd b: Yeah . Yeah . undergrad d: The idea of being able to walk into their office and say , " oh , can I borrow your machine for a while " , is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is a non - starter . phd b: Yeah . I see . undergrad d: That {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't think that 's gonna work . So , I mean , either {disfmarker} either we figure out how to use a machine somebody already {disfmarker} in the group already owns , {vocalsound} a a and the idea is that if it 's it perk , you know , it 's an advantage not {disfmarker} not a disadvan {comment} {vocalsound} or else we {disfmarker} we literally buy a machine e exactly for that purpose . phd b: Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Absolutely . Yeah . undergrad d: Certainly it solves a lot of the problems with leaving a monitor out here all the time . phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm not a big fan of doing things to the room that make the room less attractive for other people , grad a: Right . undergrad d: right ? Which is part of the reason for getting all this stuff out of the way grad a: Yeah . undergrad d: and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and , so a monitor sitting here all the time you know people are gonna walk up to it and go , " how come I can't get , you know , Pong on this " or , whatev grad a: Mm - hmm . Right . I 've {disfmarker} I 've borrowed the IRAM VAIO Sony thingy , phd c: Well {disfmarker} grad a: and I don't think they 're ever gonna want it back . phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: Right . phd b: You 're kidding ! undergrad d: Well , the next conference they will . grad a: So . Sure . undergrad d: Yeah . grad a: But that does mean {disfmarker} so we can use that as well . undergrad d: Well , uh , the {disfmarker} certainly , u you should give it a shot first See whether you you can get compatible stuff . phd b: Mm - hmm . undergrad d: Uh , ask them what it costs . Ask them if they have an extra one . Who knows , they might have an extra {vocalsound} hardware s phd b: I 'd trade them a flat panel display for it . Yeah . phd c: What is the , um , projector supposed to be hooked up to ? undergrad d: Good . Uh , the , uh {disfmarker} Tsk . It 's gonna be hooked up to all sorts of junk . There 's gonna be actually a {disfmarker} a plug at the front that 'll connect to people 's laptops so you can walk in and plug it in . And it 's gonna be con connected to the machine at the back . So we certainly could use that as {disfmarker} as a constant reminder of what the VU meters are doing . phd b: Huge VU meters . undergrad d: So people sitting here {comment} are going {vocalsound} " testing , one , two , three " ! phd c: But I mean , that 's another {disfmarker} that 's another possibility that , you know , solves {disfmarker} undergrad d: It {disfmarker} a phd b: Yeah . undergrad d: Yeah . phd b: That 's an end undergrad d: But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but I think the idea of having a control panel it 's {disfmarker} that 's there in front of you is really cool . phd b: Yeah . Yeah , yeah . postdoc e: Mm - hmm . phd b: I think and uh , having {disfmarker} having it on wireless is {disfmarker} is the neatest way {disfmarker} neatest way to do it . undergrad d: R grad a: I had {disfmarker} undergrad d: As long as you d as l as long as you 're not tempted to sit there and f keep fiddling with the volume controls going , " can you talk a bit louder ? " phd b: Yeah . grad a: I had actually earlier asked if I could borrow one of the cards to do wireless stuff phd b: Yeah . grad a: and they said , " sure , whenever you want " . So I think it won't be a problem . phd b: Oh , cool . OK . undergrad d: And {disfmarker} and it 's a {disfmarker} a PCMCIA card , right ? grad a: Yep . undergrad d: PC card , grad a: PC card . undergrad d: so you can have a slot , phd b: Yeah , yeah . undergrad d: right ? In your new machine ? phd c: It 's {disfmarker} it really come down to the driver . undergrad d: Is it with s phd b: Yeah . phd c: I mean {disfmarker} grad a: Right , I mean , and if {disfmarker} and if his doesn't work , as I said , we can use the PC . undergrad d: Right , i it 'll {disfmarker} it 'll work {disfmarker} It 'll work the first time . I {disfmarker} I trust Steve Jobs . grad a: Good . phd b: Um , grad a: So {disfmarker} phd b: well , that sounds like a d good solution one way or the other . grad a: So Jim is gonna be doing wiring and you 're gonna give some thought to cabinets ? undergrad d: Uh , y yeah . grad a: Great . undergrad d: We {disfmarker} we need to {vocalsound} figure out what we want . Uh {disfmarker} phd b: We 'd {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} undergrad d: Hey , what are those green lights doing ? grad a: They 're flashing ! phd b: Uh - oh ! Uh - oh ! Does that {disfmarker} it means {disfmarker} it means it 's gonna explode . No . undergrad d: Cut the red wire , the red wire ! phd b: Um {disfmarker} grad a: When people talk , it {disfmarker} they go on and off . phd b: This {disfmarker} So again , Washington wants to equip a system . Our system , we spent ten thousand dollars on equipment not including the PC . However , seven and a half thousand of that was the wireless mikes . Uh , undergrad d: Mm - hmm . phd b: using {disfmarker} using these {disfmarker} undergrad d: And it {disfmarker} and the f the five thousand for the wires , so if I 'm gonna do {disfmarker} No . phd b: Yeah , undergrad d: It 's a joke . phd b: that 's true undergrad d: I have to do {disfmarker} phd b: but we haven't spent that , right ? But once we {disfmarker} once we 've done the intellectual part of these , uh , we can just knock them out , right ? grad a: Cheap . phd b: We can start {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} you can make a hundred of them or something . undergrad d: Oh , of the {disfmarker} of the boards ? Yeah , yeah , sure , right . phd b: And then we could {disfmarker} Washington could have a system that didn't have any wireless but would had {disfmarker} what 's based on these undergrad d: Mm - hmm . phd b: and it would cost {disfmarker} grad a: A PC and a peanuts . undergrad d: Peanuts . phd b: PC and two thousand dollars for the A - to - D stuff . grad a: Yeah . phd b: And that 's about {disfmarker} cuz you wouldn't even need the mixer if you didn't have the {disfmarker} Oh th {vocalsound} the P Z undergrad d: Right . phd b: P Z Ms cost a lot . But anyway you 'd save , on the seven {disfmarker} seven or eight thousand for the {disfmarker} for the wireless system . So actually that might be attractive . undergrad d: Right . grad a: Good . phd b: OK , I can move my thumb now . postdoc e: That 's a great idea . undergrad d: What ? postdoc e: It 's nice {disfmarker} it 's nice to be thinking toward that . undergrad d: Oh , I thought like if we talked softer the disk lasts longer . grad a: Well , actually shorten {disfmarker} phd b: Yeah . grad a: There 's a speech compression program that works great on things like this , cuz if the dynamic range is low it encodes it with fewer bits . And so most of the time no one 's talking so it shortens it dramatically . But {vocalsound} if you talk quieter , the dynamic range is lower and it will compress better . So . phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: Oh . Hmm . undergrad d: It also helps if you talk in a monotone . grad a: Probably . undergrad d: Constant volume all the time . postdoc e: Oh , interesting . And shorter words . grad a: Shorter words . phd c: Now , shorter words wouldn't {disfmarker} would induce more dynamics , right ? You want to have {disfmarker} phd b: Yeah , but if the words are more predictable . grad a: How about if you just go " uh " ? phd c: Huh . undergrad d: Uh . postdoc e: That 's a long word ! grad a: How do you spell that ? postdoc e: I don't know . grad a: OK , can you do one more round of digits ? Are we done talking ? undergrad d: Well it 's a choice {disfmarker} if we get a choice , let 's keep talking . grad a: Do we have more to talk about ? undergrad d: Sure . No , I 'm done . phd c: I 'm done . grad a: Are you done ? postdoc e: I 'm done , grad a: I 'm done . postdoc e: yeah . phd c: Dan isn't but he 's not gonna say anything . undergrad d: But {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} there 's a problem {disfmarker} a structural problem with this though . You really need an incentive at the end if you 're gonna do digits again . Like , you know , candy bars or something , grad a: I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll remember to bring M and M 's next time . undergrad d: or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or or a little , uh {disfmarker} you know , toothbrushes like they give you at the d dentist . phd b: Mmm ! postdoc e: Or both . undergrad d: Or both . phd b: Sorry . undergrad d: Eric , you and I win . We didn't make any mistakes . grad a: It 's harder at the end than at the beginning . postdoc e: We don't know that for sure , do we ? grad a: I should have mentioned that s uh , to pause between lines but {disfmarker} undergrad d: No , I know . I 'm just giving you a hard time . grad a: It 's {disfmarker} it 's only a hard time for the transcriber not for the speech recognizer . phd b: Tha - tha postdoc e: But {disfmarker} I also think you said channel four grad a: Me . postdoc e: and I think you meant microphone four . And I think that 's a mistake . undergrad d: Very good . So Eric , you win . But the other thing is that there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a colon for transcripts . And there shouldn't be a colon . Because see , everything else is stuff you fill in . phd b: Yeah , that 's been filled in for you . undergrad d: Right ? Automatically . phd b: But they 're in order ! undergrad d: But real phd b: They start , six , seven , eight , nine , zero , one , two , three , four , five , six , eight , nine . undergrad d: Where 'd they come from ? phd b: And they 're in order because they 're sorted lexically by the file names , which are {disfmarker} have the numbers in digits . postdoc e: Oh . phd b: And so they 're actually {disfmarker} this is like all the {disfmarker} all utterances that were generated by speaker MPJ or something . postdoc e: Oh . phd b: And then within MPJ they 're sorted by what he actually said . grad a: Ugh ! I didn't know that . I should have randomized it . postdoc e: Wow . phd b: It doesn't matter ! It 's like {disfmarker} Cuz you said " six , seven , eight " . undergrad d: Well , we think it doesn't matter . phd b: We think it doesn't matter . If I {disfmarker} if not I {disfmarker} undergrad d: But the real question I have is that , why bother with these ? postdoc e: Oh , interesting . undergrad d: Why don't you just ask people to repeat numbers they already know ? Like phone numbers , you know , social security numbers . phd b: Cuz we have these writt written down , right ? grad a: Because {disfmarker} Right . phd b: That 's why {disfmarker} grad a: If we have it , uh {disfmarker} undergrad d: I know . postdoc e: Social security numbers . undergrad d: I kn grad a: we don't have to transcribe . phd b: You can {disfmarker} you can generate {disfmarker} postdoc e: Bank account numbers . undergrad d: Credit card numbers , grad a: We don't have to tran undergrad d: yeah . grad a: Yeah , please . phd b: Yeah . That 's a great idea . postdoc e: Passport numbers . undergrad d: Yeah , so you just say {disfmarker} {vocalsound} say your credit card numbers , say your phone numbers , say your mother 's maiden name . grad a: Bet we could do it . undergrad d: You know pe postdoc e: Password to your account . undergrad d: people off the street . postdoc e: Go on . undergrad d: This {disfmarker} grad a: Actually , this {disfmarker} I got this directly from another training set , from Aurora . phd b: Alright . grad a: So . We can compare directly . phd b: Looks good . Looks like there were no errors . postdoc e: I was {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} the reason I made my mistake was {disfmarker} grad a: What ? postdoc e: Wa - was this {disfmarker} ? phd b: There were no {disfmarker} there were no direct driver errors , by the look of it , which is good . grad a: Great . postdoc e: Good news . grad a: OK , the mike 's off . phd b: So I 'm gonna stop it . Yeah , OK . postdoc e: OK . grad a: Thank you all . undergrad d: Mony on the mike . phd b: Uh - oh .
