grad d: And we already got the crash out of the way . It did crash , so I feel much better , earlier . professor f:  Yeah . postdoc e: Interesting . Hmm . professor f: Will you get the door , and {disfmarker} ?  grad d: OK , so um . professor f: OK . You collected an agenda , huh ? grad d: I did collect an agenda . So I 'm gonna go first . Mwa - ha - ha ! It shouldn't take too long . postdoc e: Yeah . grad d: Um , so we 're pretty much out of digits . We 've gone once through the set . Um , so the only thing I have to do professor f: No there 's only ten . grad d: Yeah , that 's right . so I {disfmarker} I just have to go through them professor f: Well , OK . grad d: and uh pick out the ones that have problems , and either correct them or have them re - read . So we probably have like four or five more forms to be read , to be once through the set . I 've also extracted out about an hour 's worth . We have about two hours worth . I extracted out about an hour 's worth which are the f digits with {disfmarker} for which whose speaker have speaker forms , have filled out speaker forms . Not everyone 's filled out a speaker form . So I extracted one for speakers who have speaker forms and for meetings in which the " key " file and the transcript files are parsable . Some of the early key files , it looks like , were done by hand , and so they 're not automatically parsable and I have to go back and fix those . So what that means is we have about an hour of transcribed digits that we can play with . Um , Liz {disfmarker} professor f: So you think two {disfmarker} you think two hours is the {disfmarker} is the total that we have ? grad d: Yep , yeah . professor f: And you think we th uh , I {disfmarker} I didn't quite catch all these different things that are not quite right , but you think we 'll be able to retrieve the other hour , reasonably ? grad d: Yes , absolutely . professor f: OK . grad d: So it 's just a question of a little hand - editing of some files and then waiting for more people to turn in their speaker forms . I have this web - based speaker form , and I sent mail to everyone who hadn't filled out a speaker form , and they 're slowly s trickling in . professor f: So the relevance of the speaker form here , s grad d: It 's for labeling the extracted audio files . professor f: Oh , OK . grad d: By speaker ID and microphone type . professor f: Wasn't like whether they were giving us permission to use their digits or something . grad d: No , I spoke with Jane about that and we sort of decided that it 's probably not an issue that {disfmarker} We edit out any of the errors anyway . Right ? So the there are no errors in the digits , professor f: Yeah . grad d: you 'll always read the string correctly . So I can't imagine why anyone would care . So the other topic with digits is uh , Liz would like to elicit different prosodics , and so we tried last week with them written out in English . And it just didn't work at all because no one grouped them together . So it just sounded like many many more lines instead of anything else . So in conversations with Liz and uh Jane we decided that if you wrote them out as numbers instead of words it would elicit more phone number , social security number - like readings . The problem with that is it becomes numbers instead of digits . When I look at this , that first line is " sixty one , sixty two , eighteen , eighty six , ten . " Um , and so the question is does anyone care ? Um , I 've already spoken with Liz and she feels that , correct me if I 'm wrong , that for her , connected numbers is fine , postdoc e: Mm - hmm . grad d: as opposed to connected digits . Um , I think two hours is probably fine for a test set , but it may be a little short if we actually wanna do training and adaptation and all that other stuff . professor f: Yeah Um , do um you want different prosodics , so if you always had the same groupings you wouldn't like that ? Is that correct ? phd g: Well , we actually figured out a way to {disfmarker} grad d: Yeah , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} phd g: the {disfmarker} the groupings are randomly generated . professor f: No but , I was asking if that was something you really cared about because if it wasn't , it seems to me if you made it really specifically telephone groupings that maybe people wouldn't , uh , go and do numbers so much . You know if it if it 's {disfmarker} phd a: Uh {disfmarker} phd g: I think they may still do it , um , professor f: Maybe some , but I probably not so much . phd b: What about putting a hyphen between the numbers in the group ? phd g: And {disfmarker} professor f: Right ? So if you {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if you have uh grad d: Six dash one , you mean ? professor f: if you go six six six uh dash uh two nine three one . phd g: I {disfmarker} well OK {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} it might help , I would like to g get away from having only one specific grouping . professor f: That 's what I was asking , yeah . phd g: Um , so if that 's your question , professor f: Yeah . phd g: but I mean it seems to me that , at least for us , we can learn to read them as digits postdoc e: Yeah . phd g: if that 's what people want . I {disfmarker} I 'm postdoc e: Yeah . phd g: don't think that 'd be that hard to read them as single digits . postdoc e: I agree . phd g: Um , and it seems like that might be better for you guys since then you 'll have just more digit data , grad d: Right . phd g: and that 's always a good thing . grad d: Yep . phd g: It 's a little bit better for me too because the digits are easier to recognize . They 're better trained than the numbers . grad d: So we could just , uh , put in the instructions " read them as digits " . professor f: Right . phd g: Right . Right , read them as single digits , so sixty - one w is read as six one , postdoc e: Mm - hmm . phd g: and if people make a mistake we {disfmarker} grad d: How about " O " versus " zero " ? professor f: I mean , the other thing is we could just bag it because it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's - I 'm not worrying about it I mean , because we do have digits training data that we have from uh from OGI . I 'm sorry , digits {disfmarker} numbers training that we have from OGI , we 've done lots and lots of studies with that . And um . phd g: But it 's nice to get it in this room with the acous professor f: Yeah . phd g: I mean {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} professor f: No , no , I guess what I 'm saying is that grad d: Just let them read it how they read it . professor f: to some extent maybe we could just read them {disfmarker} have them read how {disfmarker} how they read it and it just means that we have to expand our {disfmarker} our vocabulary out to stuff that we already have . phd g: Right . Well that 's fine with me as long as {disfmarker} It 's just that I didn't want to cause the people who would have been collecting digits the other way to not have the digits . professor f: Yeah . We can go back to the other thing later . phd g: So {disfmarker} professor f: I mean we s we {disfmarker} we 've {disfmarker} We can do this for awhile phd g: OK . professor f: and then go back to digits for awhile , or um . Do yo I mean , do you want {disfmarker} do you want this {disfmarker} Do you need training data or adaptation data out of this ? phd g: OK . professor f: How much of this do you need ? with uh the {disfmarker} phd g: It 's actually unclear right now . I just thought well we 're {disfmarker} if we 're collec collecting digits , and Adam had said we were running out of the TI forms , I thought it 'd be nice to have them in groups , and probably , all else being equal , it 'd be better for me to just have single digits professor f: OK . phd g: since it 's , you know , a recognizer 's gonna do better on those anyway , um , and it 's more predictable . So we can know from the transcript what the person said and the transcriber , in general . professor f: OK , well if you pre phd g: But if they make mistakes , it 's no big deal if the people say a hundred instead of " one OO " . and also w maybe we can just let them choose " zero " versus " O " as they {disfmarker} as they like because even the same person c sometimes says " O " and sometimes says " zero " in different context , professor f: Yeah . phd g: and that 's sort of interesting . So I don't have a Specific need cuz if I did I 'd probably try to collect it , you know , without bothering this group , but If we can try it {disfmarker} grad d: OK so {disfmarker} so I can just add to the instructions to read it as digits not as connected numbers . postdoc e: Mm - hmm . phd g: Right , and you can give an example like , you know , " six {disfmarker} sixty - one would be read as six one " . grad d: Right . postdoc e: Mm - hmm . And i actually it 's no more artificial than what we 've been doing with words . phd g: And I think people will get it . postdoc e: I 'm sure people can adapt to this , read it single . phd g: Right , right . postdoc e: The spaces already bias it toward being separated . phd g: It 's just easier to read . postdoc e: And I know I 'm gonna find this easier than words . phd g: Right . grad d: Oh yeah , absolutely , cognitively it 's much easier . phd g: OK I also had a hard {disfmarker} hard time with the words , professor f: Yeah . phd g: but then we went back and forth on that . OK , so let 's give that a try grad d: OK . And is the spacing alright or do you think there should be more space between digits and groups ? professor f: OK . phd g: and {disfmarker} grad d: Or is that alright ? phd g: I mean what do other people think cuz you guys are reading {comment} them . postdoc e: I think that i it 's fine . grad d: OK . postdoc e: I it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} to me it looks like you 've got the func the idea of grouping and you have the grou the idea of separation phd g: OK . postdoc e: and , you know , it 's just a matter of u i the instructions , that 's all . phd g: Great . OK . grad d: And I think there are about ten different gouping patterns professor f: Let 's try it . phd g: Well let 's give it a try . grad d: isn't that right , Liz ? That we did . phd g: Righ - right , and you just {disfmarker} they 're randomly {nonvocalsound} generated and randomly assigned to digits . postdoc e: I did {disfmarker} Mm - hmm . professor f: So we have {disfmarker} postdoc e: Go ahead . professor f: Sorry , I {disfmarker} I was just gonna say , so we have in the vicinity of forty hours of {disfmarker} of recordings now . And you 're saying two hours , uh , is digits , so that 's roughly the ratio then , grad d: Yep . professor f: something like twenty {disfmarker} twenty to one . Which I guess makes {disfmarker} makes sense . So if we did another forty hours of recordings then we could get another couple hours of this . grad d: Right . professor f: Um , yeah like you say , I think a couple hours for a {disfmarker} for a {disfmarker} for a test {disfmarker} test set 's OK . It 'd be nice to get , you know , more later because we 'll {disfmarker} we might use {disfmarker} use this up , uh , in some sense , postdoc e: Mm - hmm . grad d: Right . professor f: but {disfmarker} but uh {disfmarker} postdoc e: Yeah , I also would like to argue for that cuz it {disfmarker} it seems to me that , um , there 's a real strength in having the same test replicated in {disfmarker} a whole bunch of times and adding to that basic test bank . grad d: Right . postdoc e: Hmm ? Cuz then you have , you know , more and more , u chances to get away from random errors . And I think , um , the other thing too is that right now we have sort of a stratified sample with reference to dialect groups , and it might be {disfmarker} there might be an argument to be made for having uh f for replicating all of the digits that we 've done , which were done by non - native speakers so that we have a core that totally replicates the original data set , which is totally American speakers , and then we have these stratified additional language groups overlapping certain aspects of the database . grad d: Right . I think that uh trying to duplicate , spending too much effort trying to duplicate the existing TI - digits probably isn't too worthwhile because the recording situation is so different . professor f: Yeah . grad d: It 's gonna be very hard to be comparable . postdoc e: Except that if you have the stimuli {pause} comparable , then it says something about the {disfmarker} the contribution of setting professor f: No it 's {disfmarker} it 's not the same . postdoc e: and {disfmarker} professor f: A little bit , but the other differences are so major . grad d: Yeah I mean read versus not . postdoc e: OK . professor f: They 're such major sources of variance that it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's uh {disfmarker} postdoc e: What 's an example of a {disfmarker} of m some of the other differences ? Any other a difference ? professor f: Well i i individual human glottis {vocalsound} is going to be different for each one , postdoc e: OK . professor f: you know , it 's just {disfmarker} There 's so many things . grad d: Well , and not just that , postdoc e: OK . professor f: it 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and enunciation . grad d: I mean the uh the corpus itself . I mean , we 're collecting it in a read digit in a particular list , and I 'm sure that they 're doing more specific stuff . I mean if I remember correctly it was like postman reading zipcodes and things like that . professor f: TI - digits was ? grad d: I thought so . professor f: I thought {disfmarker} I thought it was read . grad d: Was it read ? professor f: Yeah , I think the reading zipcode stuff you 're thinking of would be OGI . grad d: Oh , I may well be . professor f: Yeah , no TI - digits was read in th in read in the studio I believe . grad d: I haven't ever listened to TI - digits . So I don't really know how it compares . professor f: Yeah . Yeah . grad d: But {disfmarker} but regardless it 's gonna {disfmarker} it 's hard to compare cross - corpus . professor f: But it {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} It - it 's different people {pause} is the {disfmarker} is the core thing . grad d: So . postdoc e: OK , fine . professor f: And they 're different circumstances with different recording environment and so forth , so it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's really pretty different . But I think the idea of using a set thing was just to give you some sort of framework , so that even though you couldn't do exact comparisons , it wouldn't be s valid scientifically at least it 'd give you some kind of uh frame of reference . Uh , you know it 's not {disfmarker} phd b: Hey Liz , What {disfmarker} what do the groupings represent ? postdoc e: OK . phd b: You said there 's like ten different groupings ? phd g: Right , just groupings in terms of number of groups in a line , and number of digits in a group , and the pattern of groupings . phd b: Mm - hmm . Are the patterns {disfmarker} like are they based on anything or phd g: Um , I {disfmarker} I just roughly looked at what kinds of digit strings are out there , and they 're usually grouped into either two , three , or four , four digits at a time . phd b: Oh . phd g: And they can have , I mean , actually , things are getting longer and longer . In the old days you probably only had three sequences , and telephone numbers were less , and so forth . So , there 's between , um {disfmarker} Well if you look at it , there are between like three and five groups , and each one has between two and four groupings and {disfmarker} I purposely didn't want them to look like they were in any kind of pattern . phd b: Mmm . phd g: So grad d: And which group appears is picked randomly , and what the numbers are are picked randomly . phd b: Mm - hmm . grad d: So unlike the previous one , which I d simply replicated TI - digits , this is generated randomly . phd g: Right . phd a: Oh OK . phd b: Mmm , oh , OK . phd g: But I think it 'd be great i to be able to compare digits , whether it 's these digits or TI - digits , to speakers , um , and compare that to their spontaneous speech , and then we do need you know a fair amount of {disfmarker} of digit data because you might be wearing a different microphone grad d: Mm - hmm . phd g: and , I mean {disfmarker} so it 's {disfmarker} it 's nice to have the digits you know , replicated many times . Especially for speakers that don't talk a lot . grad d: Yeah . phd g: So {vocalsound} um , for adaptation . No , I 'm serious , phd a: Yeah . grad d: Yeah all we have for some people is digits . professor f: Yeah . phd g: so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation , and we 're not using the digit data now , but you know {disfmarker} grad d: Oh , you 're not . phd g: Not for adaptation , nope . v W we 're not {disfmarker} we were running adaptation only on the data that we ran recognition on and I 'd {disfmarker} As soon as someone started to read transcript number , that 's read speech and I thought " well , we 're gonna do better on that , grad d: Oh I see . phd g: that 's not fair to use " . grad d: Oh yeah that 's true , absolutely . phd a: OK . phd g: But , it might be fair to use the data for adaptation , so . So those speakers who are very quiet , {comment} shy {disfmarker} grad d: That would be interesting to see whether that helps . phd g: r Right {disfmarker} phd b: Like Adam ? grad d: Do you think that would help adapting on {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , I have a real problem with that . professor f: Yeah . phd g: Well , it sh I mean it 's the same micropho see the nice thing is we have that in the {disfmarker} in the same meeting , grad d: Right . Same {disfmarker} same acoustics , professor f: Yeah . phd g: and so you don't get {disfmarker} grad d: same microphone , phd a: Yeah . grad d: same channel . phd g: Right , and so I still like the idea of having some kind of {pause} digit data . grad d: OK . Good . professor f: Yeah I mean , for the {disfmarker} for the um acoustic research , for the signal - processing , farfield stuff , I see it as {disfmarker} as {disfmarker} as the place that we start . But , th I mean , it 'd be nice to have twenty hours of digits data , but {disfmarker} but uh the truth is I 'm hoping that we {disfmarker} we through the {disfmarker} the stuff that {disfmarker} that you guys have been doing as you continue that , we get , uh , the best we can do on the spontaneous stuff uh , uh nearfield , and then um , we do a lot of the testing of the algorithms on the digits for the farfield , and at some point when we feel it 's mature and we understand what 's going on with it then we {disfmarker} we have to move on to the spontaneous data with the farfield . So . postdoc e: Great . phd g: The only thing that we don't have , I know this sounds weird , and maybe it 's completely stupid , but we don't have any overlapping digits . grad d: Yeah , we talked about that a couple times . phd g: An - yea I know it 's weird , but um {disfmarker} phd a: Overlapping digits ! grad d: The {disfmarker} the problem I see with trying to do overlapping digits is the cognitive load . phd g: Alright everybody 's laughing . OK . grad c: Dueling digits . grad d: No it 's {disfmarker} it 's not stupid , it 's just {disfmarker} I mean , try to do it . phd g: I 'm just talkin for the stuff that like Dan Ellis is gonna try , grad d: I mean , here , let 's try it . phd g: you know , cross - talk cancellation . grad d: You read the last line , I 'll read the first line . professor f: Let 's try it . phd g: OK . phd a: Oh ! phd g: Wait {disfmarker} oh it {disfmarker} these are all the same forms . professor f: Sixty - one . phd g: OK {comment} So but {disfmarker} grad d: So {disfmarker} so you read the last line , I 'll read the first line . professor f: No , I 'll p phd g: So you plu you plug your ears . grad d: Oh I guess if you plug you 're ears you could do it , but then you don't get the {disfmarker} the same effects . phd a: Yeah . phd g: Well , what I mean is actually no not the overlaps that are well - governed linguistically , but the actual fact that there is speech coming from two people grad d: Yeah . phd g: and the beam - forming stuf all the acoustic stuff that like Dan Ellis and {disfmarker} and company want to do . grad d: Oh I see . phd g: Digits are nice and well behaved , I mean grad d: I guess we could try . phd g: Anyway , it 's just a thought . grad d: We could try doing some . phd g: It {disfmarker} it would go faster . phd b: Parallel . phd g: It would take one around {comment} amount of ti phd b: It 's the P - make of digit reading . grad d: Well {disfmarker} Well OK . Well let 's try it . phd g: That 's right . I {disfmarker} I mea I 'm {disfmarker} I was sort of serious , but I really , I mean , I 'm {disfmarker} I don't feel strongly enough that it 's a good idea , professor f: See , y grad d: You do the last line , I 'll do the first line . phd g: so . professor f: OK . grad d: O . {comment} That 's not bad . professor f: No , I can do it . phd b: I couldn't understand a single thing you guys were saying . phd g: A and that prosody was great , by the way . postdoc e: I think it was numbers , but I 'm not sure . phd g: It {disfmarker} it sort of sounded like a duet , or something . phd a: Yeah . phd b: Performance art . professor f: Alright , let 's try three at once you {disfmarker} you pick one in the middle . phd a: The Aurora theater . phd g: OK . professor f: Go . phd g: I 'm sorry . I 'm mean I think it 's doable , grad d: The poor transcribers phd g: I 'm just {disfmarker} grad d: they 're gonna hate us . phd g: So , we {disfmarker} we could have a round like where you do two at a time , and then the next person picks up when the first guy 's done , or something . phd a: So pairwise . professor f: Oh like a round , yeah , like in a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} phd g: Like a , phd a: Yeah , just pairwise , professor f: yeah . phd g: what do you call it ? phd a: or yeah . grad c: Round . grad d: A round . professor f: Row , row , row your boat . phd g: Li - a r like {disfmarker} grad d: Mm - hmm . professor f: Yeah . phd g: yeah , like that . professor f: OK . phd b: It 's gonna require some coordination . phd g: Then it would go like h twice as fast , or {pause} a third as fast . postdoc e: You have to have a similar pace . phd g: Anyway , it 's just a thought . professor f: Yeah . phd g: I 'm actually sort of serious if it would help people do that kind o but the people who wanna work on it we should talk to them . professor f: I don't think we 're gonna collect vast amounts of data that way , phd g: So . grad d: Mmm . professor f: but I think having a little bit might at least be fun for somebody like Dan to play around with , phd g: OK . grad d: I think maybe if we wanted to do that we would do it as a separate session , professor f: yeah . phd g: Yeah . grad d: something like that rather than doing it during a real meeting and you know , do two people at a time then three people at a time and things like that . So . phd g: Can try it out . grad d: See {disfmarker} see what Dan thinks . phd g: If we have nothing {disfmarker} if we have no agenda we could do it some week . grad d: Yeah , right . professor f: Yeah , yeah . Spend the whole time reading digits with different qu quantities . phd g: OK . grad d: I thought this was gonna be fast . postdoc e: c c Can I can I have an another {disfmarker} another question w about this ? grad d: Oh well . postdoc e: So , um , there are these digits , which are detached digits , but there are other words that contain the same general phon phoneme sequences . Like " wonderful " has " one " in it and {disfmarker} and Victor Borge had a {disfmarker} had a piece on this where he inflated the digits . Well , I wonder if there 's , um , an if there would be a value in having digits that are in essence embedded in real words to compare in terms of like the articulation of " one " in " wonderful " versus " one " as a digit being read . professor f: That 's " two " bad . Yeah . phd g: I 'm all " four " it . postdoc e: There you go . grad d: Not after I " eight " though . professor f: Uh , they don't all work as well , do they ? Hmm . What does nine work in ? grad c: Nein ! grad d: Uh . professor f: Uh , grad c: You scream it . grad d: Nein ! You have to be German , professor f: Oh . In German , phd a: That 's German , yeah . phd b: It 's great for the Germans . professor f: yeah . grad d: yeah . phd g: Oh , oh ! postdoc e: Nein . professor f: That 's right ! phd a: Yeah . grad d: Oh ! grad c: It only sounds w good when you scream it , though . So . professor f: I think everybody 's a little punchy here {vocalsound} today . postdoc e: Well , I mean , I just wanted to offer that as a possible task professor f: Yes . postdoc e: because , you know , if we were to each read his embedded numbers words in sent in sentences cuz it 's like an entire sketch he does and I wouldn't take the inflated version . So he talks about the woman being " two - derful " , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} a But , you know , if it were to be deflated , just the normal word , it would be like a little story that we could read . professor f: Mm - hmm . postdoc e: I don't know if it would be useful for comparison , but it 's embedded numbers . grad d: I think for something like that we 'd be better off doing like uh TIMIT . professor f: Well I don't know . Well I think the question is what the research is , so I mean , I presume that the reason that you wanted to have these digits this way is because you wanted to actually do some research looking at the prosodic form here . grad d: Hmm . professor f: Yeah OK . phd g: Right , yeah . professor f: So if somebody wanted to do that , if they wanted to look at the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the difference of the uh phones in the digits in the context of a word versus uh the digits {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a non - digit word versus in digit word , uh that would be a good thing to do , but I think someone would have to express interest in that . postdoc e: I see . OK . professor f: I think , to {disfmarker} I mean if you were interested in it then we could do it , for instance . postdoc e: OK , thank you . grad d: OK , are we done with digits ? postdoc e: Huh . grad d: Um , We have ASR results from Liz , transcript status from Jane , and disk space and storage formats from Don . Does {disfmarker} do we have any prefer preference on which way we wanna {disfmarker} we wanna go ? phd g: Well I was actually gonna skip the ASR results part , in favor of getting the transcription stuff talked about grad d: Mm - hmm . phd g: since I think that 's more important to moving forward , but I mean Morgan has this paper copy and if people have questions , um , it 's pretty preliminary in terms of ASR results because we didn't do anything fancy , but I think e just having the results there , and pointing out some main conclusions like it 's not the speaking style that differs , it 's the fact that there 's overlap that causes recognition errors . And then , the fact that it 's almost all insertion errors , which you would expect but you might also think that in the overlapped regions you would get substitutions and so forth , um , leads us to believe that doing a better segmentation , like your channel - based segmentation , or some kind of uh , echo cancellation to get basically back down to the individual speaker utterances would be probably all that we would need to be able to do good recognition on the {disfmarker} on the close - talking mikes . phd a: So these {disfmarker} grad d: Um , why don't you , if you have a hard copy , why don't you email it to the list . phd g: So , that 's about the summary {disfmarker} But this is {disfmarker} Morgan has this paper . phd a: Yeah , yeah . grad d: Oh it 's in the paper . professor f: Yeah , so it 's the same thing ? phd g: I mean he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} professor f: It 's the same thing I mailed to every everybody that w where it was , phd g: it {disfmarker} it 's that paper . grad d: OK . phd g: Yeah , yeah . grad d: OK then , it 's already been mailed . phd g: So , we basically , um , did a lot of work on that professor f: yeah . phd g: and it 's {disfmarker} Let 's see , th I guess the other neat thing is it shows for sure w that the lapel , you know within speaker is bad . grad d: Horrible ? phd g: And it 's bad because it picks up the overlapping speech . phd a: So , your {disfmarker} your ASR results were run on the channels synchronized , phd g: Yes , cuz that 's all that w had been transcribed at the time , phd a: OK . OK . OK . phd g: um but as we {disfmarker} I mean I wanted to here more about the transcription . If we can get the channel asynchronous or the {disfmarker} phd a: Yeah . phd g: the closer t that would be very interesting for us phd b: So if {disfmarker} phd g: because we {disfmarker} professor f: Yeah , that 's {disfmarker} that 's why I only used the part from use phd a: Yeah . professor f: which we had uh about uh about the alt over all the channels phd a: Yeah . phd g: Right . That 's {disfmarker} phd a: Yeah sure . Yeah . professor f: or mixed channel phd a: Yeah . professor f: rather mixed signal . phd b: So if there was a segment of speech this long phd g: cuz {disfmarker} phd a: Yeah . phd b: and oh and someone said " oh , " the whole thing was passed to the recognizer ? grad d: And someone said " oh " in the front {disfmarker} in the middle . phd a: There were several speakers in it , yeah . phd g: That 's right . In fact I {disfmarker} I pulled out a couple classic examples in case you wanna u use them in your talk of phd b: That 's why there 's so many insertion errors ? grad c: Mm - hmm . phd g: Chuck on the lapel , so Chuck wore the lapel three out of four times . grad c: Mmm . grad d: I noticed that Chuck was wearing the lapel a lot . phd b: Early on , yeah . phd g: Um , yeah , and I wore the lapel once , and for me the lapel was OK . I mean I still {disfmarker} and I don't know why . I 'm {disfmarker} But um , grad d: Probably how you wear it {disfmarker} wore it I would guess . phd g: for you it was {disfmarker} Or who was next to me or something like that . grad c: Yeah , where you were sitting probably affected it . phd a: Yeah . phd g: Right , but when Chuck wore the lapel and Morgan was talking there 're a couple really long utterances where Chuck is saying a few things inside , and it 's picking up all of Morgan 's words pretty well and so the rec you know , there 're error rates because of insertion {disfmarker} Insertions aren't bounded , so with a one - word utterance and ten insertions you know you got huge error rate . grad d: Uh - huh . phd a: Yeah . phd g: And that 's {disfmarker} that 's where the problems come in . So I this is sort of what we expected , but it 's nice to be able to {disfmarker} to show it . grad d: Right . phd g: And also I just wanted to mention briefly that , um , uh Andreas and I called up Dan Ellis who 's still stuck in Switzerland , and we were gonna ask him if {disfmarker} if there 're {disfmarker} you know , what 's out there in terms of echo cancellation and things like that . Not that we were gonna do it , but we wanted to know what would need to be done . grad d: And he said , " Lots lots lots lots . " phd g: And he {disfmarker} We 've given him the data we have so far , so these sychronous cases where there are overlap . phd a: Yep . phd g: And he 's gonna look into trying to run some things that are out there and see how well it can do phd b: So {disfmarker} phd g: because right now we 're not able to actually report on recognition in a real paper , like a Eurospeech paper , because it would look sort of premature . phd b: So {disfmarker} So the idea is that you would take this big hunk where somebody 's only speaking a small amount in it , and then try to figure out where they 're speaking {comment} based on the other peopl phd g: Right . Or who 's {disfmarker} At any point in time who 's the foreground speaker , who 's the background speaker . phd a: So yeah {disfmarker} phd b: I thought we were just gonna move the boundaries in . phd a: Yeah , should it {disfmarker} phd g: So . grad d: Well that 's with the hand stuff . phd g: So there 's like {disfmarker} grad d: But how would you do that automatically ? phd g: Well ther there 's {disfmarker} phd a: Uh , I 've actually done some experiments with cross - correlation phd b: Right . phd a: and it seems to work pretty well to {disfmarker} to get rid of those {disfmarker} those overlaps , grad d: I mean that that 's the sort of thing that you would do . professor f: Mm - hmm . phd g: Yeah . phd a: yeah . grad d: So . phd g: Yeah . Exactly , so it 's {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} phd b: So why do you want to do echo cancellation ? phd g: Um , it would be techniques used from adaptive {disfmarker} adaptive echo cancellation which I don't know enough about to talk about . phd b: Uh - huh . professor f: It {disfmarker} just {disfmarker} it just to r to remove cross - talk . phd g: Um . grad c: Yeah . professor f: Yeah . phd g: But , right , um , and that would be similar to what you 're also trying to do , but using um , you know , more than energy {disfmarker} phd a: Yeah . phd g: I {disfmarker} I don't know what exactly would go into it . phd a: Yeah , sure . phd b: So it would be {disfmarker} phd g: So the idea is to basically run this on the whole meeting . and get the locations , which gives you also the time boundaries of the individual speak phd b: OK . So do sort of what he 's already {disfmarker} what he 's trying to do . phd g: Right . Except that there are many techniques for the kinds of cues , um , that you can use to do that . phd a: Yeah , in another way , phd b: OK , I s I see . phd a: yeah . Yeah . phd b: Yeah . I see . professor f: Yeah , Dave {disfmarker} Dave uh is , um , also gonna be doin usin playing around with echo cancellation for the nearfield farfield stuff , phd g: So . professor f: so we 'll be {disfmarker} phd g: And I guess Espen ? This {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} is he here too ? professor f: Yeah . phd g: May also be working {disfmarker} So it would just be ver that 's really the next step because we can't do too much , you know , on term in terms of recognition results knowing that this is a big problem phd b: Mm - hmm . phd g: um , until we can do that kind of processing . And so , once we have some {disfmarker} some of yours , phd a: OK . Yeah I 'm working on it . phd g: and @ @ we 'll move on . phd b: I think this also ties into one of the things that Jane is gonna talk about too . grad d: Um , phd g: OK . grad d: I also wanted to say I have done all this chopping up of digits , postdoc e: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . grad d: so I have some naming conventions that we should try to agree on . So let 's do that off - line , phd g: Oh right . grad d: we don't need to do it during the meeting . phd g: Yeah . grad c: OK . phd g: Right . Definitely {disfmarker} grad d: And {disfmarker} and I have scripts that will extract it out from " key " files phd g: Uh , and Don should {disfmarker} grad d: and {disfmarker} and do all the naming automatically , phd g: OK . grad c: Alright . grad d: so you don't have to do it by hand . phd g: Great . grad c: You 've compiled the list of , uh , speaker names ? phd g: So that that 's it for the {disfmarker} grad d: Mm - hmm . phd g: Speakers and {disfmarker} OK . grad c: Not names , but I Ds . grad d: Yep . Yeah , names {disfmarker} names in the {disfmarker} names to I Ds , grad c: OK . grad d: so you phd g: Great . grad d: and it does all sorts of matches because the way people filled out names is different on every single file so it does a very fuzzy sort of match . phd g: Right . grad c: Cool . phd g: So at this point we can sort of finalize the naming , and so forth , grad c: Mm - hmm . grad d: Yep . phd g: and we 're gonna basically re rewrite out these waveforms that we did because as you notice in the paper your " M O in one meeting and " M O - two " in another meeting and it 's {disfmarker} we just need to standardize the grad c: Yeah . That was my fault . phd g: um , no it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} professor f: No , I didn't notice that actually .  phd g: um , that 's why those comments are s {vocalsound} are in there . grad c: Yeah . Then disregard it then . grad d: Yep . So th I now have a script that you can just say basically look up Morgan , phd g: So {disfmarker} professor f: Yeah . phd g: Right . OK . grad d: and it will give you his ID . phd g: Great , great . grad c: OK . grad d: So . Um , phd g: Terrific . grad d: alright . Do we {disfmarker} Don , you had disk space and storage formats . Is that something we need to talk about at the meeting , or should you just talk with Chuck at some other time ? grad c: Um , I had some general questions just about the compression algorithms of shortening waveforms and I don't know exactly who to ask . I thought that maybe you would be the {disfmarker} the person to talk to . So , is it a lossless compression {comment} when you compress , grad d: Mm - hmm . grad c: so {disfmarker} grad d: Entropy coding . grad c: It just uses entropy coding ? grad d: So . grad c: OK . So , I mean , I guess my question would be is I just got this new eighteen gig drive installed . Um , yeah , which is {disfmarker} grad d: And I assume half of it is scratch and half of it is {disfmarker} ? grad c: I 'm not exactly sure how they partitioned it . grad d: Probably , yeah . grad c: But um , professor f: That 's typical , huh . grad c: yeah , I don't know what 's typical here , but um , it 's local though , so {disfmarker} grad d: That doesn't matter . grad c: But {disfmarker} grad d: You can access it from anywhere in ICSI . N {disfmarker} grad c: OK . Alright . How do you do that ? professor f: In fact , this is an eighteen gig drive , {comment} or is it a thirty six gig drive with eighteen {disfmarker} grad d: N {disfmarker} grad c: Eighteen . phd g: Eigh - eighteen . It was a spare that Dave had around {disfmarker} grad d: Slash N slash machine name , slash X A in all likelihood . professor f: Oh OK . grad c: Oh I see . OK . Alright , I did know that . grad d: Um , so the {disfmarker} the only question is how much of it {disfmarker} The distinction between scratch and non - scratch is whether it 's backed up or not . grad c: Mm - hmm . Right . grad d: So what you wanna do is use the scratch for stuff that you can regenerate . grad c: OK . grad d: So , the stuff that isn't backed up is not a big deal because disks don't crash very frequently , grad c: Right . grad d: as long as you can regenerate it . grad c: Right . I mean all of this stuff can be regenerated , phd g: Yeah it 's {disfmarker} grad c: it 's just a question {disfmarker} grad d: Then put it all on scratch phd g: Well the {disfmarker} grad d: because we 're {disfmarker} ICSI is {disfmarker} is bottlenecked by backup . postdoc e: Mm - hmm , very good point . phd g: Yeah . grad c: OK . grad d: So we wanna put {disfmarker} phd g: Well I 'd leave all the {disfmarker} All the transcript stuff shouldn't {disfmarker} should be backed up , postdoc e: Mm - hmm . phd g: but all the waveform {disfmarker} {comment} Sound files should not be backed up , grad c: Yeah , I guess {disfmarker} Right . phd g: the ones that you write out . grad c: OK . So , I mean , I guess th the other question was then , should we shorten them , downsample them , or keep them in their original form ? Um {disfmarker} grad d: It just depends on your tools . I mean , because it 's not backed up and it 's just on scratch , if your sc tools can't take shortened format , I would leave them expanded , grad c: Right . grad d: so you don't have to unshorten them every single time you wanna do anything . grad c: OK . phd g: We can downsample them , grad c: Do you think that 'd be OK ? phd g: so . grad c: To downsample them ? phd g: Yeah . Yeah , we get the same performance . grad c: OK . phd g: I mean the r the front - end on the SRI recognizer just downsamples them on the fly , grad c: Yeah , I guess the only argument against downsampling is to preserve just the original files in case we want to experiment with different filtering techniques . phd g: so {disfmarker} So that 's {disfmarker} professor f: I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm sorry {disfmarker} phd g: Yeah , if professor f: Yeah , l I mean over all our data , we {disfmarker} we want to not downsample . phd g: fe You 'd {disfmarker} you wanna not . OK . professor f: Yeah . phd g: So we 're {disfmarker} what we 're doing is we 're writing out {disfmarker} I mean , this is just a question . We 're writing out these individual segments , that wherever there 's a time boundary from Thilo , or {disfmarker} or Jane 's transcribers , you know , we {disfmarker} we chop it {pause} there . professor f: Yeah . Mm - hmm . phd g: And the reason is so that we can feed it to the recognizer , professor f: Mm - hmm . phd g: and throw out ones that we 're not using and so forth . professor f: Yeah . phd g: And those are the ones that we 're storing . grad d: Yeah , as I said , since that 's {disfmarker} it 's regeneratable , what I would do is take {disfmarker} downsample it , phd g: So {disfmarker} Yeah . grad d: and compress it however you 're e the SRI recognizer wants to take it in . phd g: Yeah . professor f: ye phd g: So we can't shorten them , grad c: Right . phd g: but we can downsample them . professor f: Yeah , I mean {disfmarker} yeah , I 'm sorry . phd g: So . professor f: As {disfmarker} yeah , as long as there is a {disfmarker} a form that we can come from again , that is not downsampled , {comment} then , grad c: r Yeah . phd g: Oh yeah th grad c: Yeah those are gonna be kept . phd g: Yeah . Yeah . That {disfmarker} that 's why we need more disk space professor f: uuu phd g: cuz we 're basically duplicating the originals , um {disfmarker} professor f: Yeah . grad d: Right . professor f: Then it 's fine . But for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} fu future research we 'll be doing it with different microphone positions and so on phd g: Oh yeah . grad c: Right . grad d: Yep . phd g: No . We always have the original long ones . professor f: we would like to {disfmarker} phd b: So the SRI front - end won't take a uh {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} a large audio file name and then a {disfmarker} a list of segments to chop out {comment} from that large audio file ? professor f: Yeah . phd b: They actually have to be chopped out already ? phd g: Um , it 's better if they 're chopped out , phd b: Uh - huh . phd g: and {disfmarker} and it {disfmarker} it will be {disfmarker} yeah , y we could probably write something to do that , but it 's actually convenient to have them chopped out cuz you can run them , you know , in different orders . You c you can actually move them around . grad d: And that 's the whole point about the naming conventions phd g: Uh , you can get rid of grad d: is that you could run all the English speaking , phd g: Yeah , it it 's a lot faster . grad d: all the native speakers , and all the non - native speakers , phd g: Right . You can grab everything with the word " the " in it , grad d: and all the men , and all the women . Yeah . phd g: and it 's {disfmarker} That 's a lot quicker than actually trying to access the wavefile each time , find the time boundaries and {disfmarker} So in principle , yeah , you could do that , phd b: I don't {disfmarker} I don't think that 's really right . phd g: but it 's {disfmarker} but it 's um {disfmarker} grad d: " That 's just not right , man . " The {disfmarker} the point {disfmarker} phd g: These are long {disfmarker} These are long {disfmarker} grad d: So {disfmarker} so s For example , what if you wanted to run {disfmarker} run all the native speakers . phd g: You know . This is an hour of speech . grad d: Right , so if {disfmarker} if you did it that way you would have to generate a program that looks in the database somewhere , extracts out the language , finds the time - marks for that particular one , do it that way . The way they 're doing it , you have that already extracted and it 's embedded in the file name . And so , you know , you just say {disfmarker} phd g: We - yeah that 's {disfmarker} so that 's part of it grad d: y so you just say you know " asterisk E asterisk dot wave " , and you get what you want . phd g: is {disfmarker} Right . And the other part is just that once they 're written out it {disfmarker} it is a lot faster to {disfmarker} to process them . grad d: Rather than doing seeks through the file . phd g: So . Otherwise , you 're just accessing {disfmarker} grad d: This is all just temporary access , so I don't {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} it 's all just {disfmarker} It 's fine . You know . Fine to do it however is convenient . phd g: Right . professor f: I mean it just depends how big the file is . If the file sits in memory you can do extremely fast seeks phd g: Right . The other thing is that , believe it or not {disfmarker} I mean , we have some {disfmarker} professor f: but . grad d: Yeah and they don't . Two gig ? phd g: So we 're also looking at these in Waves like for the alignments and so forth . You can't load an hour of speech into X Waves . professor f: Yeah . phd g: You need to s have these small files , and in fact , even for the Transcriber program Um {disfmarker} grad d: Yes you can . phd b: Yeah , you {disfmarker} you can give Waves a start and an end time . And middle . phd g: Yeah , if you try to load s really long waveform into X Waves , you 'll be waiting there for {disfmarker} phd b: No , I {disfmarker} I 'm not suggesting you load a long wave file , phd g: Oh phd b: I 'm just saying you give it a start and an end time . And it 'll just go and pull out that section . grad d: I th w The transcribers didn't have any problem with that did they Jane ? postdoc e: What 's th u w in what respect ? phd g: Loading the long {disfmarker} phd a: No , with the Transcriber tool , it 's no problem . grad d: They loaded {disfmarker} they loaded the long long files into X Waves . phd g: It takes a very long ti phd a: Yeah just to load a transcription postdoc e: In the {disfmarker} in Mm - hmm . phd a:  phd g: Right . phd a: takes a long time , phd g: It takes a l very long time . phd a: but not for the wavefile . The wavefile is there immediately . postdoc e: Mm - hmm . Yeah . grad d: Are you talking about Transcriber or X Waves ? phd g: Huh . phd a: Yeah . Oh , I 'm tr talking about Transcriber . phd g: Actually , you 're talking about Transcriber , right ? phd a: Yeah . grad d: Because {disfmarker} because i we used X Waves to do the digits . postdoc e: It was also true of the digits task which was X Waves . grad d: And they were loading the full mixed files then , postdoc e: Yeah . Very quickly . grad d: and it didn't seem to be any problem . postdoc e: I agree . phd g: Huh . Well we {disfmarker} we have a problem with that , you know , time - wise on a {disfmarker} It - it 's a lot slower to load in a long file , grad d: Hmm . Seemed really fast . phd g: and also to check the file , so if you have a transcript , um , grad d: Well regardless , it 's {disfmarker} professor f: Yeah . phd g: I mean it 's {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think overall you could get everything to work by accessing the same waveform and trying to find two {disfmarker} you know , the begin and end times . Um , but I think it 's more efficient , if we have the storage space , to have the small ones . grad d: and , it 's no problem , right ? phd g: Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} grad d: Because it 's not backed up . phd g: Yeah . grad d: So we just {disfmarker} phd g: It 's {disfmarker} it 's just {disfmarker} grad d: If we don't have a spare disk sitting around we go out and we buy ourselves an eighty gigabyte drive and make it all scratch space . You know , it 's not a big deal . postdoc e: You 're right about the backup being {pause} a bottleneck . phd g: Right . postdoc e: It 's good to think towards scratch . phd g: Yeah , so these wouldn't be backed up , the {disfmarker} postdoc e: Yeah . professor f: Yep . phd g: Right . grad d: So remind me afterward phd g: And {disfmarker} grad d: and I 'll {disfmarker} and we 'll look at your disk and see where to put stuff . grad c: OK . Alright . I mean , I could just u do a DU on it right ? And just see which {disfmarker} how much is on each {disfmarker} So . grad d: Yep . Each partition . And you wanna use , either XA or scratch . grad c: OK . grad d: Well X question mark , anything starting with X is scratch . grad c: OK . postdoc e: With two {disfmarker} two digits . grad d: Two digits , right , XA , XB , XC . OK ? professor f: So , @ @ . grad d: Jane ? postdoc e: OK . So I got a little print - out here . So three on this side , three on this side . And I stapled them . OK . Alright so , first of all , um , there was a {disfmarker} an interest in the transcribe transcription , uh , checking procedures and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and I can {vocalsound} tell you first , uh , to go through the steps although you 've probably seen them . Um , as you might imagine , when you 're dealing with , um , r really c a fair number of words , and uh , @ @ {comment} natural speech which means s self - repairs and all these other factors , that there 're lots of things to be , um , s standardized and streamlined and checked on . And , um , so , I did a bunch of checks , and the first thing I did was obviously a spell - check . And at that point I discovered certain things like , um , " accommodate " with one " M " , that kind of thing . And then , in addition to that , I did an exhaustive listing of the forms in the data file , which included n detecting things like f faulty punctuation and things {disfmarker} phd b: I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sorry to interrupt postdoc e: Yeah ? phd b: you could {disfmarker} could I just back up a little bit postdoc e: Sure , please , phd b: and {disfmarker} postdoc e: yeah , please , please . phd b: So you 're doing these {disfmarker} So {pause} the whole process is that the transcribers get the conversation postdoc e: Yeah , yeah , yeah . phd b: and they do their pass over it . postdoc e: Yes . phd b: And then when they 're finished with it , it comes to you , postdoc e: That 's right . phd b: and you begin these sanit these quality checks . postdoc e: Exactly . I do these checks . phd b: OK . postdoc e: Uh - huh . phd b: OK . postdoc e: Exactly . Yeah . Thank you . And so , uh , I do a {disfmarker} an exhaustive listing of the forms {disfmarker} Actually , I will go through this in {disfmarker} in order , so if {disfmarker} if we could maybe wait and stick keep that for a second cuz we 're not ready for that . grad d: So on the fifth page , seven down {disfmarker} postdoc e: Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Exactly ! Exactly ! Alright so , {vocalsound} a spelling check first then an exhaustive listing of the , uh {disfmarker} all the forms in the data with the punctuation attached and at that point I pick up things like , oh , you know , word followed by two commas . And th and then another check involves , uh , being sure that every utterance has an identifiable speaker . And if not , then that gets checked . Then there 's this issue of glossing s w so - called " spoken - forms " . So there {disfmarker} mo for the most part , we 're keeping it standard wo word level transcription . But there 's {disfmarker} w And that that 's done with the assumption that {pause} pronunciation variants can be handled . So for things like " and " , the fact that someone doesn't say the " D " , uh that 's not important enough to capture in the transcription because a {disfmarker} a good pronunciation , uh , you know , model would be able to handle that . However , things like " cuz " where you 're lacking an entire very prominent first syllable , and furthermore , it 's a form that 's specific to spoken language , those are r reasons {disfmarker} f for those reasons I {disfmarker} I kept that separate , and used the convention of using " CUZ " for that form , however , glossing it so that it 's possible with the script to plug in the full orthographic form for that one , and a couple of others , not many . So " wanna " is another one , " going {disfmarker} " uh , " gonna " is another one , with just the assumption , again , that this {disfmarker} th these are things which it 's not really fair to a c consider {disfmarker} expect that {disfmarker} a pronunciation model , to handle . And Chuck , you in you indicated that " cuz " is {disfmarker} is one of those that 's handled in a different way also , didn't you ? Did I {disfmarker} phd b: I don't remember . postdoc e: OK . So {disfmarker} so it might not have been {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It might not have been you , phd b: Hmm . postdoc e: but someone told me that in fact " cuz " is treated differently in , um , i u in this context because of that r reason that , um , it 's a little bit farther than a pronunciation variant . OK , so after that , let 's see , phd b: So that was part of the spell - check , {comment} or was that {disfmarker} that was after the spell - check ? postdoc e: um . Well so when I get the exhau So the spell - check picks up those words because they 're not in the dictionary . phd b: Uh - huh . postdoc e: So it gets " cuz " and " wanna " and that {disfmarker} grad d: And then you gloss them ? postdoc e: Yeah , mm - hmm . Run it through {disfmarker} I have a sed {disfmarker} You know , so I do sed script saying whenever you see " gonna " you know , " convert it to gonna " , you know , " gloss equals quote going - to quote " , you know . And with all these things being in curly brackets grad d: Mm - hmm . postdoc e: so they 're always distinctive . OK , I also wrote a script which will , um , retrieve anything in curly brackets , {vocalsound} or anything which I 've classified as an acronym , and {disfmarker} a pronounced acronym . And the way I tag ac pronounced acronyms is that I have underscores between the components . So if it 's " ACL " then it 's " A " underscore " C " underscore " L " . grad d: And so {disfmarker} so your list here , are these ones that actually occurred in the meetings ? postdoc e: And the th Yes . Uh - huh , yeah . grad d: Whew ! postdoc e: OK , so now . Uh and {disfmarker} a grad d: We are acronym - loaded . phd g: Um , can I ask a question about the glossing , uh before we go on ? postdoc e: Yeah . phd g: So , for a word like " because " is it that it 's always predictably " because " ? I mean , is " CUZ " always meaning " because " ? postdoc e: Yes , but not the reverse . So sometimes people will say " because " in the meeting , and if {disfmarker} if they actually said " because " , then it 's written as " because " with no {disfmarker} w " cuz " doesn't even figure into the equation . professor f: But {disfmarker} but in our meetings people don't say " hey cuz how you doing ? " phd g: Beca - because {disfmarker} Right . {comment} {vocalsound} Right . grad d: Except right there . postdoc e: Yeah . professor f: Yeah . phd g: Um , so , I guess {disfmarker} So , from the point of view of {disfmarker} postdoc e: That 's a good point . phd g: The {disfmarker} the only problem is that with {disfmarker} for the recognition we {disfmarker} we map it to " because " , grad d: Well , phd g: and so if we know that " CUZ " {disfmarker} postdoc e: That 's fine . grad d: but they have the gloss . postdoc e: Well Don has a script . grad c: Yeah . phd g: but , we don't {disfmarker} grad d: You have the gloss form so you always replace it . postdoc e: Exactly . grad d: If that 's how {disfmarker} what you wanna do . postdoc e: Uh - huh . And Don knows this , grad c: Yeah . postdoc e: and he 's bee he has a glo he has a script that {disfmarker} grad c: I replace the " cuz " with " because " if it 's glossed . phd g: S Right . But , if it 's {disfmarker} OK . grad c: And {disfmarker} phd g: But then there are other glosses that we don't replace , right ? Because {disfmarker} postdoc e: Yes . And that 's why there 're different tags on the glosses , phd g: OK . So , then it 's fine . postdoc e: on the different {disfmarker} on the different types of comments , which we 'll {disfmarker} which we 'll see in just a second . grad c: Right . phd g: OK . postdoc e: So the pronounceable acronyms get underscores , the things in curly brackets are viewed as comments . There 're comments of four types . So this is a good time to introduce that . The four types . w And maybe we 'll expand that grad d: Um {disfmarker} postdoc e: but the {disfmarker} but the comments are , um , of four types mainly right now . One of them is , um , the gloss type we just mentioned . grad d: Can {disfmarker} ca postdoc e: Another type is , um {disfmarker} grad d: So a are we done with acronyms ? Cuz I had a question on what {disfmarker} what this meant . postdoc e: I 'm still doing the overview . I haven't actually gotten here yet . grad d: Oh I 'm sorry . postdoc e: OK so , gloss is things like replacing the full form u with the , um , more abbreviated one to the left . Uh , then you have if it 's {disfmarker} uh , there 're a couple different types of elements that can happen that aren't really properly words , and wo some of them are laughs and breathes , so we have {disfmarker} uh that 's prepended with a v a tag of " VOC " . phd a: Whew !  postdoc e: And the non - vocal ones are like door - slams and tappings , and that 's prepended with a no non - vocalization . phd b: So then it {disfmarker} just an ending curly brace there , or is there something else in there . postdoc e: Oh yeah , so i e this would {disfmarker} grad d: A comment , basically . postdoc e: Let 's just take one example . phd b: Oh , oh , oh . postdoc e: And then the no non - vocalization would be something like a door - slam . They always end . So it 's like they 're paired curly brackets . And then the third type right now , {vocalsound} uh , is {pause} m things that fall in the category of comments about what 's happening . So it could be something like , you know , " referring to so - and - so " , " talking about such - and - such " , uh , you know , " looking at so - and - so " . phd b: So on the m postdoc e: Yeah . phd b: on the middle t So , in the first case that gloss applies to the word to the left . But in the middle two {disfmarker} Th - it 's not applying to anything , right ? postdoc e: Yeah , and this gets substituted here . grad d: They 're impulsive . phd b: OK . postdoc e: Huh - uh . No , they 're events . phd b: OK . grad d: Well the " QUAL " can be {disfmarker} The " QUAL " is applying to the left . postdoc e: They 're actually {disfmarker} They have the status of events . phd b: Right , I just meant the middle two ones , yeah . grad d: Yep . postdoc e: Well , and actually , um , it is true that , with respect to " laugh " , there 's another one which is " while laughing " , grad d: " While laughing " . postdoc e: and that is , uh , i i An argument could be made for this {disfmarker} tur turning that into a qualitative statement because it 's talking about the thing that preceded it , but at present we haven't been , um , uh , coding the exact scope of laughing , you know , and so to have " while laughing " , you know that it happened somewhere in there which could well mean that it occurred separately and following , or , you know , including some of the utterances to the left . Haven't been awfully precise about that , but I have here , now we 're about to get to the {disfmarker} to this now , I have frequencies . So you 'll see how often these different things occur . But , um , uh , the very front page deals with this , uh , final c pa uh , uh , aspect of the standardization which has to do with the spoken forms like " mm - hmm " and " mm - hmm " and " ha " and " uh - uh " and all these different types . And , um , uh , someone pointed out to me , this might have been Chuck , {comment} about , um {disfmarker} about how a recognizer , if it 's looking for " mm - hmmm " with three M 's , {vocalsound} and it 's transcribed with two M 's , {vocalsound} that it might {disfmarker} uh , that it might increase the error rate which is {disfmarker} which would really be a shame because um , I p I personally w would not be able to make a claim that those are dr dramatically different items . So , right now I 've standardized across all the existing data with these spoken forms . grad d: Oh good . postdoc e: I {disfmarker} I should say grad d: So it 's a small list . postdoc e: all existing data except thirty minutes which got found today . So , I 'm gonna {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I 'm gonna {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I 'm gonna check {disfmarker} grad d: That {disfmarker} that 's known as " found data " . postdoc e: Yeah , yeah . Acsu - actually yeah . I got {disfmarker} It was stored in a place I didn't expect , grad c: It 's like the z Zapruder Film . postdoc e: so {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and um , w we , uh , sh yea reconstructed how that happened . professor f: I wanna work with lost data . grad d: Yeah . It 's much easier . postdoc e: And this is {disfmarker} this 'll be great . So I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll be able to get through that tonight , and then everyth i well , actually later today probably . grad d: Hmm . postdoc e: And so then we 'll have everything following these conventions . But you notice it 's really rather a small set of these kinds of things . grad d: Yeah . postdoc e: And I made it so that these are , um , with a couple exceptions but , things that you wouldn't find in the spell - checker so that they 'll show up really easily . And , um {disfmarker} grad c: Jane , can I ask you a question ? What 's that very last one correspond to ? postdoc e: Sure . grad c: I don't even know how to pronounce that . postdoc e: Well , yeah . Now that {disfmarker} that s only occurs once , phd g: Yeah . postdoc e: and I 'm thinking of changing that . phd g: Right . grad c: Uh , is that like someone 's like burning or some such thing ? postdoc e: So - c I haven't listened to it so I don't know . grad c: Like their hair 's on fire ? postdoc e: I haven't heard it actually . I n I need to listen to that one . grad d: Ah ! phd a: It 's the Castle of Ah ! phd g: Actually we {disfmarker} we gave this to our pronunciation person , grad c: Uh , it looks like that . phd g: she 's like , " I don't know what that is either " . So . postdoc e: Did she hear the th did she actually hear it ? Cuz I haven't heard it . phd g: No , we just gave her a list of words that , you know , weren't in our dictionary and so of course it picked up stuff like this , and she just didn't listen so she didn't know . We just {disfmarker} we 're waiting on that {pause} just to do the alignments . postdoc e: Yeah . Yeah I 'm curious to se hear what it is , but I didn't know {disfmarker} wanna change it to something else until I knew . grad c: Right . phd g: Maybe it 's " argh " ? postdoc e: Well , sss , {comment} you know {disfmarker} phd g:  grad c: But that 's not really like {disfmarker} postdoc e: Hhh . grad c: No one really says " argh , " you know , postdoc e:  phd g: Yeah . Right , no one say grad c: it 's not {disfmarker} professor f: Well , you just did . phd b: Except for now ! grad c: Well , there 's another {disfmarker} there 's another word error . grad d:  postdoc e: Yeah . That 's right . grad d: Yes , that 's right . We 're gonna have a big problem when we talk about that . grad c: Cha - ching . phd g: Ah . phd b: We 're gonna never recognize this meeting . grad d: In Monty Python you say " argh " a lot . postdoc e: OK . grad c: Oh yeah ? grad d: So . Well , or if you 're a C programmer . grad c: Mmm . grad d: You say arg - C and arg - V all the time . postdoc e: Yeah , that 's right . professor f: Yeah . postdoc e: That 's right . grad c: That 's true . postdoc e: Yeah . professor f: Yeah phd g: But it has a different prosody . professor f: Arg . grad d: It does . grad c: Mm - hmm . professor f: Arg {disfmarker} arg - max , arg - min , yeah . grad d: Ah ! postdoc e: Uh , phd g: So , Jane , what 's the {disfmarker} d grad d: Maybe he died while dictating . postdoc e: so . phd g: I have one question about the the " EH " versus like the " AH " and the " UH " . postdoc e: That 's partly a nonnative - native thing , phd g: OK . postdoc e: but I have found " EH " in native speakers too . phd g:  postdoc e: But it 's mostly non - native {disfmarker} phd a: H phd b: That 's " eh " versus " ah " ? phd g: S OK . postdoc e: Eh . grad d: Eh ? phd g: " Eh , " yeah right , cuz there were {disfmarker} were some speakers that did definite " eh 's " postdoc e: Mm - hmm . phd g: but right now we {disfmarker} phd b: They were the Canadians , right ? professor f: Canadians , yeah , yeah , yeah . postdoc e: That 's right . phd g: So , it {disfmarker} it 's actually probably good for us to know the difference between the real " eh " and the one that 's just like " uh " or transcribed " aaa " postdoc e: Exactly . phd g: cuz in {disfmarker} like in Switchboard , you would see e all of these forms , but they all were like " uh " . grad d: You mean just the single letter " a " {comment} as in the particle ? phd a: The transcription or {disfmarker} grad d: Article . phd g: No , no , I mean like the {disfmarker} the " UH " , postdoc e: " UH " . grad d: Oh . phd g: or {disfmarker} the " UH " , " EH " , " AH " were all the same . And then , we have this additional non - native version of {disfmarker} uh , like " eeh " . grad c: All the " EH " 's I 've seen have been like that . They 've been like " eh " like that have bee has been transcribed to " EH " . And sometimes it 's stronger , postdoc e: Mm - hmm , that 's right . grad c: like " eeh " {comment} which is like closer to " EH " . postdoc e: Mmm . phd g: Right . grad c: But . grad d: I 'm just {disfmarker} these poor transcribers , they 're gonna hate this meeting . postdoc e: Yeah . grad c: I know . We should go off - line . postdoc e: Well , {vocalsound} we 're not doing {disfmarker} We 're not doing length . professor f: Quick Thilo , do a {disfmarker} do a filled pause for us . postdoc e: Yeah , that 's right . phd a: Ooo {comment} no . phd g: But you 're a native German speaker so it 's not a {disfmarker} not a issue for {disfmarker} phd a: Yeah . phd g: It 's only {disfmarker} grad d: Them Canadians . phd g: Onl yeah . No , only if you don't have lax vowels , I guess . grad d: Oh . phd g: Right . postdoc e: This makes sense . phd g: So it 's {disfmarker} like Japanese and Spanish postdoc e: Yeah I {disfmarker} I think you 've {disfmarker} uh - huh , yeah . grad d: Oh I see . professor f: Uh - huh . phd g: and {disfmarker} grad d: I didn't get that , postdoc e: That makes sense . grad d: OK . postdoc e: Yeah , and so , you know , I mean , th th I have {disfmarker} there are some , um , Americans who {disfmarker} who are using this " eh " too , and I haven't listened to it systematically , maybe with some of them , uh , they 'd end up being " uh 's " but , uh , I my spot - checking has made me think that we do have " eh " in also , um , American e e data represented here . But any case , that 's the {disfmarker} this is reduced down from really quite a long a much longer list , phd g: Yeah this is great . grad c: Mm - hmm . grad d: Yeah , it 's good , postdoc e: and this is grad d: yeah . phd g: This is really really helpful . postdoc e: functionally pretty , you know , also {disfmarker} It was fascinating , I was listening to some of these , uh , I guess two nights ago , and it 's just hilarious to liste to {disfmarker} to do a search for the " mm - hmm 's " . And you get " mm - hmm " and diff everybody 's doing it . grad d: And just listen to them ? Yeah . postdoc e: Just {disfmarker} I wanted to say {disfmarker} I w think it would be fun to make a montage of it because there 's a " Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . grad d: Performance art , postdoc e: Mm - hmm . " grad d: just extract them all . phd g: Right . postdoc e: It 's really {disfmarker} it 's really fun to listen to . phd b: Morgan can make a song out of it . postdoc e: All these different vocal tracts , you know , but it 's {disfmarker} it 's the same item . It 's very interesting . OK . Uh , then the acronyms y and the ones in parentheses are ones which the transcriber wasn't sure of , grad d: Oh I see . postdoc e: and I haven't been able to listen to to {disfmarker} to clarify , but you can see that the parenthesis convention makes it very easy to find them grad d: o How about question mark ? postdoc e: cuz it 's the only place where {disfmarker} where they 're used . phd a: The question marks , yeah . What are those ? postdoc e: Question mark is punctuation . So it {disfmarker} they said that @ @ {disfmarker} grad c: Mm - hmm . grad d: Oh . postdoc e: um , " DC ? " phd a: Ah . grad d: So they {disfmarker} so it 's " PLP ? " postdoc e: Exactly . Exactly . Yeah , so the only {disfmarker} Well , and I do have a stress marker here . Sometimes the contrastive stress is showing up , and , um {disfmarker} professor f: I 'm sorry , I {disfmarker} I got lost here . What - w what 's the difference between the parenthesized acronym and the non - parenthesized ? postdoc e: The parenthesized is something that the transcriber thought was ANN , but wasn't entirely sure . So I 'd need to go back or someone needs to go back , and say , you know , yes or no , professor f: Ah . postdoc e: and then get rid of the parentheses . phd g: Right . postdoc e: But the parentheses are used only in that context in the transcripts , of of noti noticing that there 's something uncertain . grad d: Yeah , P - make is {disfmarker} phd g: Yeah I mean cuz they {disfmarker} they have no idea , grad d: That 's a good one . That 's correct . phd g: right . If you hear CTPD , I mean , they do pretty well professor f: Yeah . grad c: Mm - hmm . phd g: but it 's {disfmarker} professor f: I {disfmarker} I don't recognize a lot of these . phd g: you know how are {disfmarker} how are they gonna know ? grad c: Yeah . grad d: I know ! I {disfmarker} I was saying that I think a lot of them are the Networks meeting . professor f: I {disfmarker} postdoc e: I think that 's true . professor f: Maybe . postdoc e: Yeah , absolutely . grad d: I see a few . postdoc e: NSA , phd g: Yeah . postdoc e: a lot of these are {disfmarker} are coming from them . I listened to some of that . grad c: Yeah , we don't have that many acronyms comparatively in this meeting . grad d: Although I see {disfmarker} I see plenty of uh postdoc e: Yeah . Yeah . I agree . grad c: It 's not so bad . phd g: Right . postdoc e: And Robustness has a fair amount , phd a: Yeah . grad c: Mmm . postdoc e: but the NSA group is just very very many . phd g: The recognizer , it is funny . Kept getting PTA for PDA . grad d: Yeah , that 's pretty close . professor f: Yeah . phd g: This is close , right , grad c: That 's not bad . phd g: and the PTA was in these , uh , topics about children , postdoc e: Yeah . phd g: so , anyway . postdoc e: That 's interesting . phd g: Is the P - PTA working ? postdoc e: Right and sometimes , I mean , you see a couple of these that are actually " OK 's " so it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} may be that they got to the point where {disfmarker} I mean it was low enough understandable {disfmarker} understandability that they weren't entirely sure the person said " OK . " You know , so it isn't really necessarily a an undecipherable acronym , grad c: There 's a lot of " OK 's " . postdoc e: but just n needs to be double checked . Now we get to the comments . This {disfmarker} professor f: The number to the left is the number of incidences ? grad d: Count . Yep . postdoc e: Number of times out of the entire database , professor f: Uh - huh . postdoc e: w except for that last thirty minutes I haven't checked yet . professor f: So CTS is really big here , grad d: Yeah , I wonder what it is . professor f: yeah . Yeah . phd a: So what is the difference between " papers rustling " and " rustling papers " ? professor f: IP , I know what IP is . postdoc e: I 'd have to listen . I {disfmarker} I I agree . I w I 'd like to standardize these down farther but , um , uh , uh , to me that sounds equivalent . phd a: Yeah . postdoc e: But , I {disfmarker} I 'm a little hesitant to {disfmarker} to collapse across categories unless I actually listen to them . phd a: Seems so . professor f: OK . grad d: Oh I 'm sure we 've said XML more than five times . postdoc e: Well , then , at least now . phd a: Now it 's at least six times , yeah . professor f: S s six now , yeah . postdoc e: Yeah . Six . OK well {disfmarker} professor f: Wh - the self - referential aspect of these {disfmarker} these p phd g: I 'm wai grad c: Yeah . grad d: Yes , it 's very bad . phd g: Well this is exactly how people will prove that these meetings do differ because we 're recording , right ? grad d: Yes . phd g: Y no normally you don't go around saying , " Now you 've said it six times . grad d: Yeah {comment} that 's right . phd g: Now you 've said " postdoc e: But did you notice that there were seven hundred and eighty five instances of " OK " ? phd a: Seven hundred eighty - five instances . postdoc e: And that 's just without the {disfmarker} without punc punctuation . grad c: Yeah . grad d: Yep . professor f: No , I didn't . Yeah . grad d: And that 's an underestimate postdoc e: Extra forty one if it 's questioned . phd b: Where 's that ? grad d: cuz they 're Yep . professor f: So th postdoc e: On the page two of acronyms . grad c: Is this after {disfmarker} like did you do some uh replacements for all the different form of " OK " to this ? professor f: Yeah . Seven hundred eighty . postdoc e: Yeah . Of " OK " , yes . grad c: OK . postdoc e: Mm - hmm . So that 's the single existing convention for " OK " . phd b: Wait a minute , w s professor f: So now we 're up to seven hundred and eighty eight . postdoc e: Yeah that 's {disfmarker} grad c: Although , what 's {disfmarker} there 's one with a slash after it . That 's kind of disturbing . postdoc e: Yeah . grad d: Yeah , we 'll have to look at it you know . postdoc e: That 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} I looked for that one . phd g: Yeah . grad c: Anyway . postdoc e: I actually explicitly looked for that one , grad c: Mm - hmm . postdoc e: and I think that , um , I {disfmarker} I 'm not exactly sure about that . phd b: Was that somewhere where they were gonna say " new speaker " or something ? postdoc e: No , I looked for that , but that doesn't actually exist . And it may be , I don't {disfmarker} I can't explain that . grad c: That 's alright . I 'm just pointing that out . postdoc e: I i it 's the only {disfmarker} grad c: There 's {disfmarker} postdoc e: it 's the only pattern that has a slash after it , and I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's an epiphenomenon . phd g: Well there 's not @ @ . grad d: So I 'll just {disfmarker} I was just looking at the bottom of page three there , is that " to be " or " not to be " . postdoc e: Yeah . phd b: There 's no tilde in front of it , postdoc e: Oh that 's cute . phd b: so . postdoc e: That 's funny . Yeah . grad d: OK anyways , sorry . postdoc e: OK . grad d: " Try to stay on topic , Adam . " postdoc e: There is th one {disfmarker} Y well , no , that 's r that 's legitimate . So now , uh , comments , you can see they 're listed again , same deal , with exhaustive listing of everything found in everything except for these final th thirty minutes . grad d: OK so , um , on some of these QUALs , postdoc e: Yeah . grad d: are they really QUALs , or are they glosses ? So like there 's a " QUAL TCL " . postdoc e: " TCL " . Where do you see that ? grad d: Uh postdoc e: Oh , oh . The reason is because w it was said " tickle " . professor f: What 's a QUAL ? grad d: Oh I see , I see . grad c: Hmm . grad d: So it 's not gloss . OK , I see . postdoc e: Yep . grad c: Sh - shouldn't it be " QUAL TICKLE " or something ? grad d: It wasn't said " TCL " . Of course . grad c: Like {disfmarker} it 's not {disfmarker} postdoc e: On the {disfmarker} in the actual script {disfmarker} in the actual transcript , I s I {disfmarker} So this {disfmarker} this happens in the very first one . grad c: Mm - hmm . postdoc e: I actually wrote it as " tickle " . grad c: OK . postdoc e: Because we {disfmarker} they didn't say " TCL " , they said " tickle " . grad c: Yeah . postdoc e: And then , following that is " QUAL TCL " . phd g: Right . grad c: Oh I see . OK . professor f: I f I forget , what 's QUAL ? postdoc e: Qual - qualifier . phd b: It 's just comment about what they said . grad c: Yeah . postdoc e: Comment . grad c: It 's not something you wanna replace {pause} with postdoc e: Comment or contextual comment . phd b: So they didn't mean " tickle " as in Elmo , grad c: but {disfmarker} phd a: Tickle ? professor f: Yeah . phd b: they meant " tickle " as in {disfmarker} grad d: Yeah . phd g: Huh . professor f: Right . phd g: But at some point {disfmarker} I mean , we probably shoul grad d: We 'll probably add it to the language model . phd g: But we should add it to the dictionar grad d: Yeah . phd g: No , to the pronunciation model . grad d: What did I say ? phd a: To the language model {disfmarker} model . phd g: Language , uh {disfmarker} grad d: Well both . phd b: Add what , Liz ? grad d: We can go on lan lan add it to both dictionary and language model . phd g: Oh lan Oh OK - we OK phd a: Yeah . phd g: it 's in the language model , w yeah , but it so it 's the pronunciation model that has to have a pronunciation of " tickle " . grad d: Well " tickle " was pronounced " tickle " . Right ? phd a: " tickle " is pronounced " tickle " ? phd b: What are you saying ? grad d: It 's pronounced the same {disfmarker} it 's pronounced the same as the verb . phd g: I 'm sorry ! grad d: So I think it 's the language model that makes it different . phd g: Oh , sorry . What I meant is that there should be a pronunciation " tickle " for TCL as a word . phd a: Yeah . grad d: Oh I see . phd g: And that word in the {disfmarker} in , you know , it stays in the language model wherever it was . professor f: Mm - hmm . grad d: Right . Right . professor f: Right . phd g: Yeah you never would put " tickle " in the language model in that form , postdoc e:  grad d: Right . phd g: yeah . Right . There 's actually a bunch of cases like this with people 's names and {disfmarker} phd b: So how w there 'd be a problem for doing the language modeling then with our transcripts the way they are . phd g: Yes . Yeah . Yeah so th th there there 's a few cases like that where the um , the word needs to be spelled out in {disfmarker} in a consistent way as it would appear in the language , but there 's not very many of these . Tcl 's one of them . grad d: And {disfmarker} and you 'll ha you 'll have to do it sychronously . phd g: Um , y yeah . grad d: Right , so y so , whoever 's creating the new models , will have to also go through the transcripts and change them synchronously . grad c: It 's just disturbing . phd g: Right . phd b: Hmm . phd g: Right . We have this {disfmarker} there is this thing I was gonna talk to you about at some point about , you know , what do we do with the dictionary as we 're up updating the dictionary , these changes have to be consistent with what 's in the {disfmarker} Like spelling people 's names and so forth . If we make a spelling correction to their name , like someone had Deborah Tannen 's name mispelled , and since we know who that is , you know , we could correct it , grad d: You can correct it . Yeah . phd g: but {disfmarker} but we need to make sure we have the mispel If it doesn't get corrected we have to have a pronunciation as a mispelled word in the dictionary . postdoc e: Mm - hmm . phd g: Things like that . grad d: These are so funny to read . postdoc e: Well , of course now the {disfmarker} the Tannen corre the spelling c change . phd g: So . postdoc e: Uh , that 's what gets {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I picked those up in the frequency check . phd g: Right . Right . So if there 's things that get corrected before we get them , it 's {disfmarker} it 's not an issue , postdoc e: Mm - hmm . phd g: but if there 's things that um , we change later , then we always have to keep our {disfmarker} the dictionary up to date . And then , yeah , in the case of " tickle " I guess we would just have a , you know , word " TCL " which {disfmarker} phd b: Mm - hmm . grad d: You add it to the dictionary . phd g: which normally would be an acronym , you know , " TCL " grad d: Right . phd g: but just has another pronunciation . grad d: Yep . postdoc e: " ICSI " is {disfmarker} is one of those that sometimes people pronounce and sometimes they say " ICSI . " grad d: Mm - hmm . postdoc e: So , those that are l are listed in the acronyms , I actually know phd g: Oh yeah . postdoc e: they were said as letters . The others , um , e those really do need to be listened to cuz I haven't been able to go to all the IC ICSI things , phd g: Right , exactly . postdoc e: and {disfmarker} {comment} and until they 've been listened to they stay as " ICSI " . grad d: Mm - hmm . phd g: Right . professor f: Don and I were just noticing , love this one over on page three , " vocal {disfmarker} vocal gesture mimicking sound of screwing something into head to hold mike in place . " grad c: That 's great . grad d: It 's this , " rrre - rrre - rrre " . It was me . postdoc e: It was ! In fact , it was ! Yeah ! grad d: A lot of these are me the {disfmarker} the " beep is said with a high pit high pitch and lengthening . " postdoc e: He {disfmarker} he s he said {disfmarker} he said get {disfmarker} phd a: To head . grad d: That was the {disfmarker} I was imitating uh , beeping out {disfmarker} postdoc e: Yeah , that 's it . professor f: Beep . postdoc e: Perfect . Yeah that 's it . professor f: Yeah . phd g: Oh there is something spelled out " BEEEEEEP " grad c: Um {disfmarker} postdoc e: That 's it . grad c: Yeah . postdoc e: Yeah , that 's {disfmarker} that 's been changed . phd g: in the old {disfmarker} Thank you . Because he was saying , " How many E 's do I have to allow for ? " grad c: You need a lot of {disfmarker} grad d: What I meant was " beep " . grad c: You need a lot of qualification Adam . grad d: I guess so . postdoc e: That 's been changed . So , exactly , that 's where the lengthening comment c came in . grad c: Subtext . grad d: Anyway . postdoc e: s chan brought it down . phd g: Right , thanks , yeah . grad d: So they 're vocalization , phd g: Right . postdoc e: And those of course get {disfmarker} get picked up in the frequency check grad d: glosses . postdoc e: because you see " beep " phd g: Right . postdoc e: and you know {disfmarker} I mean it gets kicked out in the spelling , and it also gets kicked out in the , uh , freq frequency listing . phd g: Right . Right . postdoc e: I have the {disfmarker} there 're various things like " breathe " versus " breath " versus " inhale " and , hhh , you know , I don't know . I {disfmarker} I think they don't have any implications for anything else so it 's like I 'm tempted to leave them for now an and {disfmarker} It 's easy enough to find them when they 're in curly brackets . We can always get an exhaustive listing of these things and find them and change them . phd g: Yeah . professor f: " Sings finale - type song " grad c: Yeah , that was in the first meeting . professor f: that 's {disfmarker} that 's good . phd g: Yeah . grad d: Um , postdoc e: Yeah , but I don't actually remember what it was . But that was {disfmarker} Eric did that . professor f: Yeah . grad d: So on {disfmarker} postdoc e: Yeah . professor f: Tah - dah ! I don't know . postdoc e: I think maybe something like that . professor f: Something like that maybe , yeah . postdoc e: Well , that 'd qualify . grad d: On the glosses for numbers , postdoc e: Yeah . grad d: it seems like there are lots of different ways it 's being done . postdoc e: OK . Interesting question . grad d: There 's a {disfmarker} postdoc e: Yes . OK , now first of all {disfmarker} Ooo - ooo ! Very important . grad d: " Ooo - ooo . " postdoc e: Uh Chuck {disfmarker} Chuck led to a refinement here which is to add " NUMS " if these are parts of the read numbers . Now you already know i that I had , uh , in places where they hadn't transcribed numbers , I put " numbers " in place of any kind of numbers , but there are places where they , um , it {disfmarker} th this convention came later an and at the very first digits task in some transcripts they actually transcribed numbers . And , um , d Chuck pointed out that this is read speech , and it 's nice to have the option of ignoring it for certain other prob uh p uh , things . And that 's why there 's this other tag here which occurs a hundred and five {disfmarker} or three hundred and five times right now which is just {disfmarker} well n n " NUMS " by itself grad d: " NUMS " , yeah . postdoc e: which means this is part of the numbers task . I may change it to " digits " . I mean , i with the sed command you can really just change it however you want because it 's systematically encoded , you know ? grad d: Yep . postdoc e: Have to think about what 's the best for {disfmarker} for the overall purposes , but in any case , um , " numbers " and " NUMS " are a part of this digits task thing . Um , now th Then I have these numbers that have quotation marks around them . Um , I didn't want to put them in as gloss comments because then you get the substitution . And actually , th um , {vocalsound} the reason I b did it this way was because I initially started out with the other version , you have the numbers and you have the full form and the parentheses , however sometimes people stumble over these numbers they 're saying . So you say , " Seve - seventy eight point two " , or whatever . And there 's no way of capturing that if you 're putting the numbers off to the side . You can't have the seven and {disfmarker} grad d: So what 's to the left of these ? postdoc e: The left is i so example the very first one , grad d: Mm - hmm . postdoc e: it would be , spelled out in words , " point five " . grad d: OK , that 's what I was asking . Right . postdoc e: Only it 's spelled out in words . grad d: Point FIVE , yeah . postdoc e: So i this is also spelled out in {disfmarker} in words . " Point five . " grad d: Good . postdoc e: And then , in here , " NUMS " , so it 's not going to be mistaken as a gloss . It comes out as " NUMS quote dot five " . grad d: OK now , the other example is , in the glosses right there , postdoc e: Thank you . grad d: " gloss one one one dash one three zero " . grad c: Right . grad d: What {disfmarker} what 's to the left of that ? postdoc e: Well now {disfmarker} In that case it 's people saying things like " one one one dash so - and - so " or they 're saying uh " two {disfmarker} I mean zero " whatever . grad d: OK . postdoc e: And in that case , it 's part of the numbers task , and it 's not gonna be included in the read digits anyway , phd b: So there will be a " NUMS " tag on those lines ? postdoc e: so {disfmarker} I m in the uh {disfmarker} There is . phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: Yeah . I 've added that all now too . grad c: There 's a " numbers " tag {disfmarker} grad d: Good . grad c: I 'm sorry I 'm {disfmarker} I didn't follow that last thing . phd g: Wait . postdoc e: So , so gloss {disfmarker} in the same line that would have " gloss quote one one one dash one thirty " , you 'd have a gloss at the end of the line saying , uh , " curly bracket NUMS curly bracket " . grad c: Right . postdoc e: So if you {disfmarker} if you did a , uh , a " grep minus V nums " phd g: Oh , so you could do " grep minus V nums " . postdoc e: and you get rid of anything that was read . phd g: So that 's the {disfmarker} yeah . grad c: OK . phd g: So there wouldn't be something like i if somebody said something like , " Boy , I 'm really tired , OK . " and then started reading that would be on a separate line ? postdoc e: Yes . phd g: OK great . Cuz I was doing the " grep minus V " quick and dirty and looked like that was working OK , postdoc e: Mm - hmm . Good . phd g: but {disfmarker} postdoc e: Yep . phd g: Great . Now why do we {disfmarker} what 's the reason for having like the point five have the " NUMS " on it ? Is that just like when they 're talking about their data or something ? postdoc e: This is more because {disfmarker} phd g: Or {disfmarker} postdoc e: Yeah . Oh these are all these , the " NUMS point " , this all where they 're saying " point " something or other . phd g: These are all like inside the spontaneous {disfmarker} postdoc e: And the other thing too is for readability of the transcript . I mean if you 're trying to follow this while you 're reading it it 's really hard to read , you know {disfmarker} eh , " so in the data column five has " , you know , " one point five compared to seventy nine point six " , it 's like when you see the words it 's really hard to follow the argument . And this is just really a {disfmarker} a way of someone who would handle th the data in a more discourse - y way to be able to follow what 's being said . grad d: Label it . phd g: Oh OK . postdoc e: So this is where Chuck 's , um , overall h architecture comes in , phd g: I see . postdoc e: where we 're gonna have a master file of the channelized data . Um , there will be scripts that are written to convert it into these t these main two uses and th some scripts will take it down th e into a f a for ta take it to a format that 's usable for the recognizer an uh , other scripts will take it to a form that 's usable for the {disfmarker} for linguistics an and discourse analysis . And , um , the implication that {disfmarker} that I have is that th the master copy will stay unchanged . These will just be things that are generated , grad d: Right postdoc e: and e by using scripts . phd g: OK . grad d: Master copies of superset . postdoc e: When things change then the {disfmarker} the script will cham change but the {disfmarker} but there won't be stored copies of {disfmarker} in different versions of things . grad d: Good . phd g: So , I guess I 'd have one request here which is just , um , maybe to make it more robust , th that the tag , whatever you would choose for this type of " NUMS " {comment} where it 's inside the spontaneous speech , is different than the tag that you use for the read speech . phd b: Right . Right . That would argue for changing the other ones to be " digits " or something . phd g: Um , that way w if we make a mistake parsing , or something , we don't see the " point five " , or {disfmarker} or it 's not there , then we phd b: Mm - hmm . phd g: a Just {disfmarker} an And actually for things like " seven eighths " , or people do fractions too I guess , you {disfmarker} maybe you want one overall tag for sort of that would be similar to that , postdoc e: Except {disfmarker} phd g: or {disfmarker} As long as they 're sep as they 're different strings that we {disfmarker} that 'll make our p sort of processing more robust . postdoc e: Well {disfmarker} phd g: Cuz we really will get rid of everything that has the " NUMS " string in it . phd b: I suppose what you could do is just make sure that you get rid of everything that has " curly brace NUMS curly brace " . postdoc e: Well {disfmarker} Ex - exactly . phd b: I mean that would be the {disfmarker} postdoc e: Exactly . That was {disfmarker} that was my motivation . And i these can be changed , like I said . phd g: Yeah . postdoc e: You know , I mean , as I said I was considering changing it to " digits " . And , it just {disfmarker} i you know , it 's just a matter of deciding on whatever it is , and being sure the scripts know . phd b: Right . phd g: It would probably be safer , if you 're willing , to have a separate tag just because um , then we know for sure . And we can also do counts on them without having to do the processing . But you 're right , we could do it this way , it {disfmarker} it should work . Um , phd b: Yeah , and it makes it {disfmarker} I guess the thing about {disfmarker} phd g: but it it 's probably not hard for a person to tell the difference phd b: Yeah . phd g: because one 's in the context of a {disfmarker} you know , a transcribed word string , phd b: Right . postdoc e: The other thing is you can get really so minute with these things phd g: and {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} postdoc e: and increase the size of the files and the re and decrease the readability to such an extent by simply something like " percent " . Now I {disfmarker} I could have adopted a similar convention for " percent " , but somehow percent is not so hard , you know ? grad d: Hmm . postdoc e: i It 's just when you have these points and you 're trying to figure out where the decimal places are {disfmarker} And we could always add it later . Percent 's easy to detect . Point however is {disfmarker} is uh a word that has a couple different meanings . And you 'll find both of those in one of these meetings , where he 's saying " well the first point I wanna make is so - and - so " and he goes through four points , and also has all these decimals . phd b: So Liz , what does the recognizer do , postdoc e: So . phd b: uh , professor f: Hmm . phd b: what does the SRI recognizer output for things like that ? " seven point five " . Does it output the word {disfmarker} phd g: " Seven point five " . phd b: Right , the word " seven " ? grad d: Well , the numbers ? phd b: The number " seven " ? phd g: The word . phd b: The word " seven " , OK . professor f: Yeah . phd g: Yeah . professor f: So I 'd {disfmarker} so " I 'd like {disfmarker} I 'd like to talk about point five " . phd g: And {disfmarker} and actually , you know the language {disfmarker} professor f: Yeah . phd g: it 's the same point , actually , the {disfmarker} the p you know , the word " to " and the word y th " going to " and " to go to " those are two different " to 's " and so there 's no distinction there . phd b: Mm - hmm . phd g: It 's just {disfmarker} just the word " point " has {disfmarker} Yeah , every word has only one , yeah e one version even if {disfmarker} even if it 's {disfmarker} A actually even like the word " read " {comment} and " read " Those are two different words . They 're spelled the same way , right ? phd b: Mm - hmm . phd g: And they 're still gonna be transcribed as READ . phd b: Mm - hmm . professor f: Right . phd g: So , yeah , I {disfmarker} I like the idea of having this in there , I just {disfmarker} I was a little bit worried that , um , the tag for removing the read speech {disfmarker} because i What if we have like " read letters " or , I don't know , grad d: We might wanna {disfmarker} just a separate tag that says it 's read . phd g: like " read something " like " read " grad c: Mm - hmm . phd g: yeah , basically . But other than that I it sounds great . grad d: Yeah . OK ? Are we done ? postdoc e: Well I wanted to say also regarding the channelized data , grad d: Oh , I guess we 're not done . phd b: Yeah . postdoc e: that , um , Thilo requested , um , that we ge get some segments done by hand to e e s reduce the size of the time bins wh like was Chuc - Chuck was mentioning earlier that , um , that , um , if you {disfmarker} if you said , " Oh " and it was in part of a really long , s complex , overlapping segment , that the same start and end times would be held for that one grad d: Well {disfmarker} postdoc e: as for the longer utterances , grad d: We did that for one meeting , right , postdoc e: and {disfmarker} grad d: so you have that data don't you ? phd a: Yeah , that 's the training data . postdoc e: And he requested that there be , uh , similar , uh , samples done for five minute stretches c involving a variety of speakers and overlapping secti sections . phd a: Yeah . postdoc e: He gave me {disfmarker} he did the {disfmarker} very nice , he {disfmarker} he did some shopping through the data and found segments that would be useful . And at this point , all four of the ones that he specified have been done . In addition the I 've {disfmarker} I have the transcribers expanding the amount that they 're doing actually . phd a: Oh great . postdoc e: So right now , um , I know that as of today we got an extra fifteen minutes of that type , and I 'm having them expand the realm on either side of these places where they 've already started . phd a: Oh great . OK . postdoc e: But if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} you know , and I {disfmarker} and he 's gonna give me some more sections that {disfmarker} that he thinks would be useful for this purpose . phd a: Yeah . Yeah . postdoc e: Because it 's true , I mean , if we could do the {disfmarker} the more fine grained tuning of this , uh , using an algorithm , that would be so much more efficient . And , um . So this is gonna be {pause} useful to expand this . phd a: So I {disfmarker} I thought we {disfmarker} we sh we sh perhaps we should try to {disfmarker} to start with those channelized versions just to {disfmarker} just to try it . Give it {disfmarker} Give one tr transcriber the {disfmarker} the channelized version of {disfmarker} of my speech - nonspeech detection and look if {disfmarker} if that 's helpful for them , or just let them try if {disfmarker} if that 's better or If they {disfmarker} if they can {disfmarker} postdoc e: You mean to start from scratch f in a brand new transcript ? phd a: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . postdoc e: That 'd be excellent . Yeah , that 'd be really great . As it stands we 're still in the phase of sort of , um , cleaning up the existing data getting things , uh , in i m more tight tightly time {disfmarker} uh , aligned . I also wanna tell {disfmarker} um , I also wanted to r raise the issue that {disfmarker} OK so , there 's this idea we 're gonna have this master copy of the transcript , it 's gonna be modified by scripts t into these two different functions . And actually the master {disfmarker} phd b: Two or more . Two or more different functions . postdoc e: Two {disfmarker} two or more . And that the master is gonna be the channelized version . phd b: Right . postdoc e: So right now we 've taken this i initial one , it was a single channel basically the way it was input . And now , uh , thanks to the advances made in the interface , we can from now on use the channelized part , and , um , any changes that are made get made in the channelized version kind of thing . But I wanted to get all the finished {disfmarker} all the checks {disfmarker} phd b: Yeah , so that has implications for your script . grad c: Yeah . So , uh , have those {disfmarker} e e the vis the ten hours that have been transcribed already , have those been channelized ? And I know {disfmarker} I 've seen @ @ {disfmarker} I 've seen they 've been channelized , postdoc e: Yes , they have . grad d: All ten hours ? grad c: but postdoc e: Except for the missing thirty minutes . grad c: have they uh {disfmarker} have they been {disfmarker} has the time {disfmarker} have the time markings been adjusted , uh , p on a per channel {disfmarker} grad d: Great . postdoc e: Uh , for {disfmarker} for a total of like twenty m f for a total of {disfmarker} Let 's see , four times {disfmarker} total of about an {disfmarker} {pause} thirty minutes . That 's {disfmarker} that 's been the case . grad c: So , postdoc e: And plus the training , whatever you have . grad c: I guess , I mean , I don't know if we should talk about this now , or not , but I grad d: Well it 's just we 're {pause} missing tea . grad c: Yeah , I know . grad d: So . grad c: No , but I mean my question is like should I wait until all of those are processed , and channelized , like the time markings are adjusted before I do all the processing , and we start like branching off into the {disfmarker} into the {disfmarker} our layer of uh transcripts . postdoc e: Well , you know the problem {disfmarker} the problem is that some {disfmarker} some of the adjustments that they 're making are to bring {disfmarker} are to combine bins that were {disfmarker} time bins which were previously separate . And the reason they do that is sometimes there 's a word that 's cut off . grad c: Right . postdoc e: And so , i i i it 's true that it 's likely to be adjusted in the way that the words are more complete . And , grad c: OK . No I know {disfmarker} I know that adjusting those things are gonna {disfmarker} is gonna make it better . postdoc e: so I {disfmarker} it 's gonna be a more reliable thing and I 'm not sure {disfmarker} grad c: I mean I 'm sure about that , postdoc e: Yeah . grad c: but do you have like a time frame when you can expect like all of it to be done , or when you expect them to finish it , or {disfmarker} postdoc e: Well partly it depends on how {disfmarker} um , how e effective it will be to apply an algorithm because i this takes time , grad c: Yeah . Yeah . postdoc e: you know , it takes a couple hours t to do , uh , ten minutes . grad c: Yeah , I don't doubt it . Um , so . phd b: So right now the {disfmarker} what you 're doing is you 're taking the {disfmarker} uh , the o original version and you 're sort of channelizing yourself , right ? grad c: Yeah . I 'm doing it myself . I mean i if the time markings aren't different across channels , like the channelized version really doesn't have any more information . phd b: Mm - hmm . grad c: So , I was just {disfmarker} I mean , originally I had done before like the channelized versions were coming out . phd b: Right . Right . grad c: Um , phd b: So I {disfmarker} I th I think probably the way it 'll go is that , you know , when we make this first general version and then start working on the script , that script @ @ that will be ma you know primarily come from what you 've done , um , we 'll need to work on a channelized version of those originals . grad c: and so it 's a question of like what {disfmarker} Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . postdoc e: Mm - hmm . phd b: And so it should be pretty much identical to what you have t except for the one that they 've already tightened the boundaries on . postdoc e: Yep . Mm - hmm . grad c: Right . phd b: Um , So postdoc e: Yeah , I mean {disfmarker} phd b: uh , and then probably what will happen is as the transcribers finish tightening more and more , you know , that original version will get updated postdoc e: yeah . phd b: and then we 'll rerun the script and produce better uh versions . grad c: OK . phd b: But the {disfmarker} I guess the ef the effect for you guys , because you 're pulling out the little wave forms into separate ones , that would mean these boundaries are constantly changing you 'd have to constantly re rerun that , grad c: I know . phd b: so , maybe {disfmarker} grad c: Right . postdoc e: But that {disfmarker} phd g: But that {disfmarker} that 's not hard . postdoc e: Mm - hmm . grad c: No . phd g: I I think the harder part is making sure that the transc the transcription {disfmarker} phd b: OK . phd g: So if you b merge two things , then you know that it 's the sum of the transcripts , but if you split inside something , you don't where the word {disfmarker} which words moved . phd b: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . phd g: And that 's wh that 's where it becomes a little bit {disfmarker} uh , having to rerun the processing . phd b: Mm - hmm . phd g: The cutting of the waveforms is pretty trivial . grad c: Yeah . I mean as long as it can all be done automatically , I mean , then that 's not a concern . phd b: Mm - hmm . grad c: You know , if I just have to run three scripts to extract it all and let it run on my computer for an hour and a half , or however long it takes to parse and create all the reference file , that 's not a problem . phd g: Right . phd b: Yeah . Uh - huh . Mm - hmm . grad c: Um , so yeah . As long as we 're at that point . And I know exactly like what the steps will work {disfmarker} what 's going on , in the editing process , phd b: Yeah . grad c: so . OK . postdoc e: So that 's {disfmarker} I I mean I could {disfmarker} there were other checks that I did , but it 's {disfmarker} I think that we 've {disfmarker} unless you think there 's anything else , I think that I 've covered it . professor f: Yeah . phd b: I can't think of any of the {disfmarker} other ones . postdoc e: OK . Great . professor f: OK . grad d: Oop ! Man !
