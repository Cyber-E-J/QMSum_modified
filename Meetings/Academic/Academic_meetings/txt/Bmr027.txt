grad f: OK . phd c: Adam , what is the mike that , uh , Jeremy 's wearing ?  grad f: It 's the ear - plug mike . postdoc a: Ear - plug . phd e: That 's good . phd c: Is that a wireless , or {disfmarker} ? Oh . grad f: No . grad g: It 's wired . professor b: Oh ! postdoc a: Is that {disfmarker} Does that mean you can't hear anything during the meeting ? grad d: It 's old - school . grad f: Huh ? What ? Huh ? professor b: Should we , uh , close the door , maybe ? grad f: It {disfmarker} it 's a fairly good mike , actually . professor b: So it 's {disfmarker} Yeah . Huh . grad f: Well , I shouldn't say it 's a good mike . All I really know is that the signal level is OK . I don't know if it 's a {disfmarker} the quality . professor b: Well , that 's a grad f: Ugh ! So I didn't send out agenda items because until five minutes ago we only had one agenda item and now we have two . So . {vocalsound} And , uh . professor b: OK . So , just to repeat the thing bef that we said last week , it was there 's this suggestion of alternating weeks on {vocalsound} more , uh , automatic speech recognition related or not ? Was that sort of {pause} the division ? grad f: Right . professor b: So which week are we in ? grad f: Well {disfmarker} We haven't really started , but I thought we more {disfmarker} we more or less did Meeting Recorder stuff last week , so I thought we could do , uh {disfmarker} professor b: I thought we had a thing about speech recognition last week too . phd c: Yeah . grad f: But I figure also if they 're short agenda items , we could also do a little bit of each . professor b: Yeah . grad f: So . I seem to be having difficulty getting this adjusted . Here we go . professor b: OK . grad f: So , uh , as most of you should know , I did send out the consent form thingies and , uh , so far no one has made any {disfmarker} Ach ! {comment} {comment} any comments on them . So , no on no one has bleeped out anything . professor b: Um . Yeah . grad f: So . I don't expect anyone to . But . professor b: Um . {vocalsound} So , w what follows ? At some point y you go around and get people to sign something ? grad f: No . We had spoken w about this before professor b: Yeah , but I 've forgotten . grad f: and we had decided that they have {disfmarker} they only needed to sign once . And the agreement that they already signed simply said that we would give them an opportunity . So as long as we do that , we 're covered . professor b: And how long of an opportunity did you tell them ? grad f: Uh , July fifteenth . professor b: July fifteenth . Oh , so they have a plenty of time , and y grad f: Yep . professor b: Given that it 's that long , um , um {disfmarker} Why was that date chosen ? You just felt you wanted to {disfmarker} ? grad f: Jane told me July fifteenth . So , that 's what I set it . postdoc a: Oh . I just meant that that was {pause} the release date that you had on the {pause} data . professor b: Oh , OK . grad f: Oh . I {disfmarker} I didn't understand that there was something specific . postdoc a: I , uh {disfmarker} I thought {disfmarker} grad f: You {disfmarker} y you had {disfmarker} professor b: I don't {disfmarker} grad f: I had heard July fifteenth , so that 's what I put . postdoc a: Mm - hmm . professor b: No , the only {disfmarker} th the only {pause} mention I recall about that was just that July fifteenth or so is when {vocalsound} this meeting starts . grad f: So . postdoc a: That 's right . That 's why . professor b: Oh , I see . postdoc a: You said you wanted it to be available then . professor b: OK . postdoc a: I didn't mean it to be the hard deadline . professor b: Right . postdoc a: It 's fine with me if it is , or we cou But I thought it might be good to remind people two weeks prior to that professor b: w postdoc a: in case , uh {disfmarker} you know , " by the way {pause} this is your last {disfmarker} " professor b: Right . postdoc a: Uh . Yeah . professor b: We probably should have talked about it , cuz i because if we wanna be able to give it to people July fifteenth , if somebody 's gonna come back and say " OK , I don't want this and this and this used " , uh , clearly we need some time to respond to that . Right ? grad f: Yeah . As I said , we {disfmarker} I just got one date professor b: Yeah . phd h: Damn ! grad f: and that 's the one I used . professor b: Yeah . grad f: So . But I can send a follow - up . I mean , it 's almost all us . I mean the people who are in the meeti this meeting was , uh , these {disfmarker} the meetings that {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} are in set one . phd c: Was my {disfmarker} was my response OK ? postdoc a: That 's right . phd c: I just wrote you {disfmarker} replied to the email saying they 're all fine . grad f: Right . I mean , that 's fine . phd c: OK , good . grad f: I {disfmarker} we don't {disfmarker} My understanding of what we {pause} had agreed upon when we had spoken about this months ago was that , uh , we don't actually need a reply . phd c: That makes it easy . grad f: We just need to tell them that they can do it if they want . professor b: OK . I just didn't remember , but {disfmarker} grad f: And so no reply is no changes . postdoc a: And he 's got it so that the default thing you see when you look at the page is " OK " . professor b: OK . postdoc a: So that 's very clear all the way down the page , " OK " . And they have two options they can change it to . One of them is {pause} " censor " , and the other one is " incorrect " . Is it {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} your word is " incorrect " ? grad f: Right . postdoc a: Which means also we get feedback on {pause} if {pause} um , there 's something that they w that needs to be {pause} adjusted , because , I mean , these are very highly technical things . I mean , it 's an added , uh , level of checking on the accuracy of the transcription , as I see it . But in any case , people can agree to things that are wrong . grad f: Well {disfmarker} postdoc a: So . grad f: Yeah . The reason I did that it was just so that people would not censor {disfmarker} not ask to have stuff removed because it was transcribed incorrectly , postdoc a: And the reason I liked it was because {disfmarker} grad f: as opposed to , uh {disfmarker} postdoc a: was because it , um {disfmarker} it gives them the option of , uh , being able to correct it . grad f: Right . postdoc a: Approve it and correct it . And {pause} um . So , you have {pause} it nicely set up so they email you and , uh {disfmarker} grad f: When they submit the form , it gets processed and emailed to me . postdoc a: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . And I wanted to say the meetings that are involved in that set are Robustness and Meeting Recorder . grad f: So . postdoc a: The German ones will be ready for next week . Those are three {disfmarker} three of those . A different set of people . And we can impose {disfmarker} phd c: The German ones ? postdoc a: Uh , well . phd h: Yeah . Those {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} professor b: NSA . postdoc a: OK . I spoke loosely . The {disfmarker} the German , French {disfmarker} Sorry , the German , {vocalsound} Dutch , and Spanish ones . phd e: Spanish . Yeah . grad f: Mm - hmm . phd c: Oh , those are the NSA meetings ? phd e: The non - native {disfmarker} phd h: Those are {disfmarker} postdoc a: Yeah . Uh - huh . professor b: German , Dutch , Swiss and Spanish . phd c: Oh , oh ! OK . phd e: The all non - native {disfmarker} postdoc a: That 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that 's r grad f: Mm - hmm . phd h: Uh - huh . phd c: OK . I 'd {disfmarker} I d postdoc a: Yeah . {pause} It 's the other group . professor b: I It was the network {disfmarker} network services group . phd c: OK . postdoc a: Uh - huh . Yeah , exactly . Yeah . professor b: Yeah . postdoc a: I didn't mean to {pause} isolate them . professor b: Otherwise known as the German , Dutch , and Spanish . postdoc a: Yeah . Sorry . It was {disfmarker} it was not the best characterization . grad f: Mm - hmm . postdoc a: But what {disfmarker} {vocalsound} what I meant to say was that it 's the other group that 's not {disfmarker} n no m no overlap with our present members . And then maybe it 'd be good to set an explicit deadline , something like {pause} a week {pause} before that , uh , J July fifteenth date , or two weeks before . professor b: I mean , I would suggest we discuss {disfmarker} I mean , if we 're going to have a policy on it , that we discuss the length of time that we want to give people , grad f: Mm - hmm . professor b: so that we have a uniform thing . So , tha that 's a month , which is fine . I mean , it seems {disfmarker} phd c: Twelve hours . grad f: Well , the only thing I said in the email is that {pause} the data is going to be released on the fifteenth . I didn't give any other deadline . postdoc a: Mm - hmm . grad f: So my feeling is if someone after the fifteenth says , " wow I suddenly found something " , we 'll delete it from our record . We just won't delete it from whatever 's already been released . postdoc a: Hmm . That 's a little bit difficult . grad f: What else can we do ? postdoc a: Yeah . grad f: If someone says " hey , look , I {pause} found something in this meeting and {pause} it 's libelous and I want it removed " . What can we do ? postdoc a: Well . {pause} That 's true . grad f: We have to remove it . postdoc a: I {disfmarker} I agree with that part , but I think that it would {disfmarker} it , uh {disfmarker} we need to have , uh , a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a message to them very clearly that {vocalsound} beyond this date , you can't make additional changes . professor b: I mean , um , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i I think that somebody might {pause} request something even though we say that . But I think it 's good to at least start some place like that . postdoc a: Mm - hmm . Good . professor b: So if we agreed , {vocalsound} OK , how long is a reasonable amount of time for people to have {disfmarker} if we say two weeks , or if we say a month , I think we should just say that {disfmarker} say that , you know , i a as {pause} um , {vocalsound} " per the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the , uh , page you signed , you have the ability to look over this stuff " and so forth " and , uh , because we w " these , uh {disfmarker} I would {disfmarker} I would imagine some sort of generic thing that would say " because we , uh , will continually be making these things available {vocalsound} to other researchers , uh , this can't be open - ended and so , uh , uh , please give us back your response within this am you know , within this amount of time " , whatever time we agree upon . grad f: Well , did you read the email and look at the pages I sent ? professor b: Did I ? No , I haven't yet . No , just {disfmarker} grad f: No . OK , well why don't you do that and then make comments on what you want me to change ? professor b: No , no . I 'm not saying that you should change anything . I I 'm {disfmarker} what I 'm {disfmarker} what I 'm {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I 'm trying to spark a discussion hopefully among people who have read it so that {disfmarker} that you can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you can , uh , decide on something . postdoc a: Mm - hmm . professor b: So I 'm not telling you what to decide . postdoc a: Mm - hmm . professor b: I 'm just saying you should decide something , postdoc a: OK . professor b: and then {disfmarker} grad f: I already did decide something , and that 's what 's in the email . postdoc a: Yeah , yeah . OK , so {disfmarker} grad f: And if you disagree with it , why don't you read it and give me comments on it ? postdoc a: Yeah . Well {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think that there 's one missing line . professor b: Well , the one thing that I did read and that you just repeated to me {pause} was that you gave the specific date of July fifteenth . grad f: Mm - hmm . professor b: And you also just said that the reason you said that was because someone said it to you . So what I 'm telling you {pause} is that what you should do is come up with a length of time that you guys think is enough grad f: Right . professor b: and you should use that rather than {pause} this date that you just got from somewhere . That 's all I 'm saying . grad f: OK . professor b: OK ? postdoc a: I ha I have one question . This is in the summer period and presumably people may be out of town . But we can make the assumption , can't we ? that , um , they will be receiving email , uh , most of the month . Right ? Because if someone {disfmarker} professor b: It {disfmarker} well , it {disfmarker} well , you 're right . Sometimes somebody will be {pause} away and , uh , you know , there 's , uh {disfmarker} for any length of time that you {vocalsound} uh , choose {pause} there is some person sometime who will not {pause} end up reading it . postdoc a: OK . professor b: That 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know , just a certain risk to take . phd h: S so maybe when {disfmarker} Am I on , by the way ? grad f: I don't know . You should be . phd h: Oh . Hello ? Hello ? grad f: You should be channel B . phd h: Oh , OK . Alright . So . The , um {disfmarker} Maybe we should say in {disfmarker} w you know , when the whole thing starts , when they sign the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the agreement {vocalsound} that {disfmarker} you know , specify exactly uh , what , you know , how {disfmarker} how they will be contacted and they can , you know {disfmarker} they can be asked to give a phone number and an email address , or both . And , um , then {disfmarker} postdoc a: We did that , I {disfmarker} I believe . phd h: Right . phd e: Yeah . phd h: So . {vocalsound} A And , then , you know , say very clearly that if they don't {disfmarker} if we don't hear from them , you know , as Morgan suggested , by a certain time or after a certain {vocalsound} period after we contact them {vocalsound} that is implicitly giving their agreement . grad f: Well , they 've already signed a form . postdoc a: And the form says {disfmarker} phd e: And nobody {disfmarker} nobody really reads it anyway . phd h: Right . grad f: So . And the s and the form was approved by Human Subjects , phd h: Says that . Right . postdoc a: Uh , the f phd h: Well , if that 's i tha if that 's already {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} grad f: so , eh , that 's gonna be a little hard to modify . postdoc a: Well , the form {disfmarker} Well , the form doesn't say , if {disfmarker} uh , you know , " if you don't respond by X number of days or X number of weeks {disfmarker} " phd h: I see . Uh {disfmarker} Oh , OK . So what does it say about the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the process of {disfmarker} of , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} y the review process ? postdoc a: It doesn't have a time limit . That you 'll be provided access to the transcripts and then , uh , allowed to {pause} remove things that you 'd like to remove , before it goes to the general {disfmarker} uh , larger audience . phd h: Oh , OK . Hmm . Right . grad f: Here . postdoc a: There you go . grad f: You can read what you already signed . phd h: Oh . phd e: I guess when I {pause} read it , um {disfmarker} phd h: OK . phd e: I 'm not as diligent as Chuck , but I had the feeling I should probably respond and tell Adam , like , " I got this and I will do it by this date , and if you don't hear from me by then {disfmarker} " You know , in other words responding to your email {pause} once , right away , saying " as soon as you get this could you please respond . " grad f: Right . phd e: And then if you {disfmarker} if the person thinks they 'll need more time because they 're out of town or whatever , they can tell you at that point ? Because {disfmarker} grad f: Oh , I just {disfmarker} I didn't wanna do that , because I don't wanna have a discussion with every person {pause} if I can avoid it . phd e: Well , it 's {disfmarker} grad f: So what I wanted to do was just send it out and say " on the fifteenth , the data is released , postdoc a: Mm - hmm . grad f: if you wanna do something about it , do something about it , but that 's it " . postdoc a: I {disfmarker} I kind of like this . phd e: Well {disfmarker} postdoc a: Yeah . phd e: OK . So , we 're assuming that {disfmarker} phd h: Well , that 's {disfmarker} that would be great if {disfmarker} but you should probably have a {pause} legal person look at this and {pause} make sure it 's OK . Because if you {disfmarker} if you , uh , do this {vocalsound} and you {disfmarker} then there 's a dispute later and , uh , some {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know , someone who understands these matters concludes that they didn't have , uh , you know , enough opportunity to actually {vocalsound} exercise their {disfmarker} their right {disfmarker} phd e: Or they {disfmarker} they might never have gotten the email , because although they signed this , they don't know by which date to expect your email . And so {pause} someone whose machine is down or whatever {disfmarker} I mean , we have no {disfmarker} professor b: Mm - hmm . phd e: in internally we know that people are there , grad f: Well , OK . l Let me {disfmarker} Let me reverse this . phd e: but we have no confirmation that they got the mail . grad f: So let 's say someone {disfmarker} I send this out , and someone doesn't respond . Do we delete every meeting that they were in ? phd e: Well , then {disfmarker} grad f: I don't think so . phd e: It {disfmarker} we 're hoping that doesn't happen , phd h: No . phd e: but that 's why there 's such a thing as registered mail grad f: That will happen . phd e: or {disfmarker} phd h: That will happen . phd e: Right . grad f: That will absolutely happen . Because people don't read their email , or they 'll read and say " I don't care about that , I 'm not gonna delete anything " and they don just won't reply to it . phd h: Maybe {disfmarker} uh , do we have mailing addresses for these people ? grad f: No . We have what they put on the speaker form , phd h: No . postdoc a: Well {disfmarker} {comment} {vocalsound} Most {disfmarker} grad f: which was just generic contact information . phd h: Oh . postdoc a: But the ones that we 're dealing with now are all local , phd h: Well , then {disfmarker} postdoc a: except the ones who {disfmarker} I mean , we {disfmarker} we 're totally in contact with all the ones in those two groups . phd h: Mmm . OK . postdoc a: So maybe , uh , I {disfmarker} you know , that 's not that many people and if I {disfmarker} if , uh {disfmarker} i i there is an advantage to having them admit {disfmarker} and if I can help with {disfmarker} with processing that , I will . It 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} there is an advantage to having them be on record as having received the mail and indicating {disfmarker} grad f: Yeah . I mean I thought we had discussed this , like , a year ago . postdoc a: Yes , we did . grad f: And so it seems like this is a little odd for it to be coming up yet again . postdoc a: You 're right . Well , I {disfmarker} you know . But sometimes {disfmarker} professor b: Well , we {disfmarker} we haven't experienced it before . grad f: So . postdoc a: That 's right . professor b: Right ? So {disfmarker} phd e: You 'll either wonder {pause} at the beginning or you 'll wonder at the end . postdoc a: Need to get it right . phd e: I mean , there 's no way to get around {disfmarker} I It 's pretty much the same am amount of work except for an additional email just saying they got the email . postdoc a: Yeah . phd e: And maybe it 's better legally to wonder before {disfmarker} you know , a little bit earlier than {disfmarker} grad f: Well {disfmarker} postdoc a: It 's much easier to explain {pause} this way . grad f: OK . Well , why don't you talk {pause} t postdoc a: T t to have it on record . grad f: Morgan , can you talk to our lawyer about it , and find out what the status is on this ? Cuz I don't wanna do something that we don't need to . postdoc a: Yeah , but w Mmm . grad f: Because what {disfmarker} I 'm telling you , people won't respond to the email . No matter what you do , you there 're gonna be people who {pause} you 're gonna have to make a lot of effort to get in contact with . postdoc a: Well , then we make the effort . grad d: I mean , i it 's k grad f: And do we want to spend that effort ? phd h: Hmm . postdoc a: We make the effort . grad d: It 's kind of like signing up for a mailing list . They have opt in and opt out . And there are two different ways . I mean , and either way works probably , I mean . postdoc a: Except I really think in this case {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm agr I agree with Liz , that we need to be {pause} in the clear and not have to after the fact say " oh , but I assumed " , and " oh , I 'm sorry that your email address was just accumulating mail without notifying you " , you know . professor b: If this is a purely administrative task , we can actually have administration do it . postdoc a: Oh , excellent . professor b: But the thing is that , you know , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think , without going through a whole expensive thing with our lawyers , {vocalsound} from my previous conversations with them , my {disfmarker} my sense very {pause} much is that we would want something on record {pause} as indicating that they actually were aware of this . postdoc a: Yes . grad f: Well , we had talked about this before professor b: Mm - hmm . grad f: and I thought that we had even gone by the lawyers asking about that and they said you have to s they 've already signed away the f with that form {disfmarker} that they 've already signed once . postdoc a: I don't remember that this issue of {pause} the time period allowed for response was ever covered . grad f: Yeah . professor b: Yeah . We never really talked about that . grad f: OK . phd e: Or the date at which they would be receiving the email from you . postdoc a: Or {disfmarker} or how they would indicate {disfmarker} professor b: Yeah . phd e: They probably forgot all about it . professor b: We certainly didn't talk , uh , about {disfmarker} with them at all about , uh , the manner of them being {disfmarker} {vocalsound} made the , uh , uh , materials available . phd e: Yeah . phd h: We do it like with these {disfmarker} professor b: That was something that was sort of just within our implementation . grad f: OK . phd h: We can use it {disfmarker} we can use a {disfmarker} a ploy like they use to , um {disfmarker} you know , that when they serve , like {disfmarker} uh , uh , uh {disfmarker} {comment} uh , you know , like dead - beat dads , they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they make it look like they won something in the lottery and then they open the envelope grad d: And they 're served . phd h: and that {disfmarker} Right ? Because {disfmarker} and then the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the thing is served . So you just make it , you know , " oh , you won {disfmarker} you know , go to this web site and you 've , uh {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} " phd e: That 's why you never open these things that come in the mail . postdoc a: That one . professor b: Yeah . grad f: Well , it 's just , we 've gone from one extreme to the other , where at one point , a few months ago , Morgan was {disfmarker} you were saying let 's not do anything , phd h: Right . {vocalsound} Right . No , it I {disfmarker} it might {disfmarker} postdoc a: Well , it doesn't matter . phd h: i i it {disfmarker} it might well be the case {disfmarker} grad f: and now we 're {disfmarker} we 're saying we have to follow up each person and get a signature ? phd h: it might {disfmarker} Right . grad f: I mean , what are we gonna doing here ? phd h: It might well be the case that {disfmarker} that this is perfectly {disfmarker} you know , this is enough to give us a basis t to just , eh , assume their consent if they don't reply . professor b: Well . grad f: Mm - hmm . phd h: But , I 'm not {disfmarker} you know , me not being a lawyer , I wouldn't just wanna do that without {pause} having the {disfmarker} the expert , uh , opinion on that . postdoc a: And how many people ? Al - altogether we 've got twenty people . These people are people who read their email almost all the time . grad f: Then I think we had better find out , so that we can find a {disfmarker} phd h: Yeah . professor b: Let me look at this again . grad f: Right . postdoc a: I {disfmarker} I really don't see that it 's a problem . I {disfmarker} I think that it 's a common courtesy to ask them {disfmarker} uh , to expect for them to , uh , be able to have @ @ {comment} us try to contact them , grad f: For {disfmarker} for th postdoc a: u just in case they hadn't gotten their email . I think they 'd appreciate it . professor b: Yeah . My {disfmarker} Adam , my {disfmarker} my view before was about {pause} the nature of what was {disfmarker} of the presentation , grad f: Mm - hmm . professor b: of {disfmarker} of how {pause} my {disfmarker} my {disfmarker} the things that we 're questioning were along the lines of how easy {disfmarker} uh , h how m how much implication would there be that it 's likely you 're going to be changing something , as opposed to {disfmarker} grad f: Mm - hmm . professor b: That was the kind of dispute I was making before . postdoc a: Mm - hmm . I remember that . professor b: But , um , the attorneys , I {disfmarker} uh , I can guarantee you , the attorneys will always come back with {disfmarker} and we have to decide how stringent we want to be in these things , but they will always come back with saying {vocalsound} that , um , you need to {disfmarker} you want to have someth some paper trail or {disfmarker} which includes electronic trail {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that they have , uh , in fact {pause} O K 'd it . grad f: Mm - hmm . professor b: So , um , I think that if you f i if {pause} we send the email as you have and if there 's half the people , say , who don't respond {pause} at all by , you know , some period of time , {vocalsound} we can just make a list of these people and hand it to , uh {disfmarker} you know , just give it to me and I 'll hand it to administrative staff or whatever , grad f: Right . professor b: and they 'll just call them up and say , you know , " have you {disfmarker} Is {disfmarker} is this OK ? And would you please mail {disfmarker} you know , mail Adam that it is , if i if it , you know , is or not . " So , you know , we can {disfmarker} we can do that . phd e: The other thing that there 's a psychological effect that {disfmarker} at least for most people , that if they 've responded to your email saying " yes , I will do it " or " yes , I got your email " , they 're more likely to actually do it {comment} {pause} later {pause} than to just ignore it . professor b: Mm - hmm . phd e: And of course we don't want them to bleep things out , but it {disfmarker} it 's a little bit better if we 're getting the {disfmarker} their , uh , final response , once they 've answered you once than if they never answer you 'd {comment} at al at all . That 's how these mailing houses work . So , I mean , it 's not completely lost work because it might benefit us in terms of getting {pause} responses . postdoc a: Mm - hmm . phd e: You know , an official OK from somebody {pause} is better than no answer , even if they responded that they got your email . And they 're probably more likely to do that once they 've responded that they got the email . postdoc a: I also think they 'd just simply appreciate it . I think it 's a good {disfmarker} a good way of {disfmarker} of fostering goodwill among our subjects . Well , our participants . professor b: I think the main thing is {disfmarker} I mean , what lawyers do is they always look at worst cases . grad f: Sending lots of spam . professor b: So they s so {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} Tha - that 's what they 're paid to do . grad f: Yep . professor b: And so , {vocalsound} it is certainly possible that , uh , somebody 's server would be down or something and they wouldn't actually hear from us , and then they find this thing is in there and we 've already distributed it to someone . So , {vocalsound} what it says in there , in fact , is that they will be given an opportunity to blah - blah - blah , postdoc a: Mm - hmm . professor b: but if in fact {disfmarker} if we sent them something or we thought we sent them something but they didn't actually receive it for some reason , {vocalsound} um , then we haven't given them that . grad f: Well , so how far do we have to go ? Do we need to get someone 's signature ? Or , is email enough ? professor b: I i i em email is enough . grad f: Do we have to have it notarized ? I mean {disfmarker} OK . professor b: Yeah . I mean , I 've been through this {disfmarker} I mean , I 'm not a lawyer , but I 've been through these things a f things f like this a few times with lawyers now grad f: Mm - hmm . professor b: so I {disfmarker} I {vocalsound} I I 'm pretty comfortable with that . phd c: Do you track , um , when people log in to look at the {disfmarker} ? grad f: Uh . If they submit the form , I get it . phd c: Uh - huh . grad f: If they don't submit the form , it goes in the general web log . But that 's not sufficient . phd c: Hmm . grad f: Right ? Cuz if someone just visits the web site that doesn't {pause} imply anything in particular . phd c: Except that you know they got the mail . postdoc a: Mm - hmm . That 's right . grad f: Right . postdoc a: I {disfmarker} I could get you on the notify list if you want me to . grad f: I 'm already on it . postdoc a: For that directory ? OK , great . grad f: Mm - hmm . professor b: So again , hopefully , um , this shouldn't be quite as odious a problem either way , uh , in any of the extremes we 've talked about because {vocalsound} uh , we 're talking a pretty small {pause} number of people . grad f: W For this set , I 'm not worried , because {pause} we basically know everyone on it . professor b: Mm - hmm . postdoc a: Hmm . professor b: Mm - hmm . grad f: You know , they 're all more or less here or it 's {disfmarker} it 's Eric and Dan and so on . But for some of the others , you 're talking about visitors who are {pause} gone from ICSI , whose email addresses may or may not work , professor b: Mm - hmm . postdoc a: Oh . professor b: Mm - hmm . grad f: and {disfmarker} So what are we gonna do when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with ? postdoc a: I don't think , uh {disfmarker} They 're so recent , these visitors . grad f: Mm - hmm . postdoc a: I {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and I {disfmarker} they 're also so {disfmarker} professor b: Mm - hmm . postdoc a: They 're prominent enough that they 're easy to find through {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean , I {disfmarker} I w I 'll be able to {disfmarker} if you have any trouble finding them , I really think I could find them . grad f: Other methods ? OK . professor b: Yeah . Cuz it {disfmarker} what it {disfmarker} what it really does promise here is that we will ask their permission . Um , and I think , you know , if you go into a room and close the door and {disfmarker} and ask their permission {vocalsound} and they 're not there , it doesn't seem {comment} that that 's the intent of , uh , meaning here . So . grad f: Well , the qu the question is just whether {disfmarker} how active it has to be . I mean , because they {disfmarker} they filled out a contact information and that 's where I 'm sending the information . professor b: Right . grad f: And so far everyone has done email . There isn't anyone who did , uh , any other contact method . professor b: Well , the way ICSI goes , people , uh , who , uh , were here ten years ago still have acc {vocalsound} have forwards to other accounts and so on . grad f: Yeah . professor b: So it 's unusual that {disfmarker} that they , uh {disfmarker} grad f: So my original impression was that that was sufficient , that if they give us contact information and that contact information isn't accurate that {pause} we fulfilled our burden . professor b: Yeah . phd e: Then they just come back . phd c: All my files were still here . phd e: Same as us . postdoc a: I just {disfmarker} professor b: So if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe I will call the attorney about it . phd c: Yeah . grad f: OK . professor b: But , you know , hopefully we won't need to . postdoc a: I d I just don't think we will . For all the reasons that we 've discussed . grad f: Alright . professor b: So we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll see if we do or not . grad f: Yep . And we 'll see how many people respond to that email . postdoc a: Yeah . grad f: So far , two people have . professor b: Yeah . I think very few people will grad f: So . professor b: and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , you know , people {disfmarker} people see long emails about things that they don't think {vocalsound} is gonna be high priority , they typically , uh , don't {disfmarker} don't read it , or half read it . grad f: Right . professor b: Cuz people are swamped . postdoc a: And actually , professor b: But {disfmarker} postdoc a: um , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} didn't anticipate this so I {disfmarker} that 's why I didn't give this comment , and it {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} this discussion has made me think it might be nice to have a follow - up email within the next couple of days saying " by the way , you know , we wanna hear back from you by X date and please {disfmarker} " , and then add what Liz said {disfmarker} " please , uh , respond to {disfmarker} please indicate you received this mail . " professor b: Uh , or e well , maybe even additionally , uh , um , " Even if you 've decided you have no changes you 'd like to make , if you could tell us that " . grad f: Respond to the email . {comment} Yep . postdoc a: Mm - hmm . It is the first time through the cycle . professor b: Yeah . phd e: Right . That would {disfmarker} that would definitely work on me . You know , it makes you feel m like , um , if you were gonna p if you 're predicting that you might not answer , you have a chance now to say that . Whereas , I {disfmarker} I mean , I would be much more likely myself , phd c: And the other th phd e: given all my email , t to respond at that point , saying " you know what , I 'm probably not gonna get to it " or whatever , rather than just having seen the email , thinking I might get to it , and never really , {vocalsound} uh , pushing myself to actually do it until it 's too late . phd c: Yeah . I was {disfmarker} I was thinking that it also {pause} lets them know that they don't have to go to the page to {pause} accept this . phd e: Right . R Right . That 's true . professor b: Right . phd c: I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Yeah . So that way they could {disfmarker} they can see from that email that if they just write back and say " I got it , no changes " , they 're off the hook . professor b: Yeah . phd c: They don't have to go to the web page professor b: I mean , the other thing I 've learned from dealing with {disfmarker} dealing with people sending in reviews and so forth , uh , is , um , {vocalsound} if you say " you 've got three months to do this review " , {vocalsound} um , people do it , you know , {vocalsound} two and seven eighths months from now . phd c: and {disfmarker} phd e: Yeah . That 's true . professor b: If you say " you 've got three weeks to do this review " , they do {disfmarker} do it , you know , two and seven eighths weeks from now {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they do the review . grad f: Right . professor b: And , um {disfmarker} So , if we make it {pause} a little less time , I don't think it 'll be that much {disfmarker} grad f: Well , and also if we want it ready by the fifteenth , that means we better give them deadline of the first , if we have any prayer of actually getting everyone to respond in time . professor b: There 's the responding part and there 's also what if , uh , I mean , I hope this doesn't happen , what if there are a bunch of deletions that have to get put in and changes ? grad f: Right . professor b: Then {vocalsound} we actually have to deal with that postdoc a: Mm - hmm . Some lead time . professor b: if we want it to {disfmarker} grad f: Ugh ! Disk space , postdoc a: By the way , has {disfmarker} has Jeremy signed the form ? grad f: oh my god ! I hadn't thought about that . postdoc a: OK . grad f: That for every meeting {disfmarker} any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of . phd h: Oh . phd c: Just that channel . grad d: Can't you just do that channel ? phd c: Oh , no . We have to do {disfmarker} grad f: No , of course not . phd e: Yeah . You have to do all of them , grad f: You need all the channels . grad d: Oh . phd c: Do you have to do the other close - talking ? phd e: as well as all of these . grad d: Yeah . phd e: You have to do all {disfmarker} You could just do it in that time period , though , grad f: Yes . Absolutely . There 's a lot of cross - talk . grad g: Wow . postdoc a: Well {disfmarker} phd e: but I guess it 's a pain . grad f: Well , but you have to copy the whole file . phd e: Yeah . grad f: Right ? Because we 're gonna be releasing the whole file . phd e: Yeah . You 're right . postdoc a: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} you know , I think at a certain point , that copy that has the deletions will become the master copy . grad f: Yeah . It 's just I hate deleting any data . So I {disfmarker} I don't want {disfmarker} I really would rather make a copy of it , rather than bleep it out professor b: Are you del are you bleeping it by adding ? grad f: and then {disfmarker} Overlapping . So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's exactly a censor bleep . So what I really think is " bleep " professor b: I I I I understand , but is {disfmarker} is it summing signals grad f: and then I want to {disfmarker} professor b: or do you {pause} delete the old one and put the new one in ? grad f: I delete the old one , put the new one in . professor b: Oh , OK . Cuz {disfmarker} grad f: There 's nothing left of the original signal . professor b: Oh . Cuz if you were summing , you could {disfmarker} No . But anyway {disfmarker} grad f: Yeah . It would be qui quite easy to get it back again . postdoc a: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} And then w I was gonna say also that the they don't have to stay on the system , as you know , professor b: Yeah . phd e: Then someday we can sell the {pause} unedited versions . postdoc a: cuz {disfmarker} cuz the {disfmarker} the ones {disfmarker} grad f: Say again ? postdoc a: Once it 's been successfully bleeped , can't you rely on the {disfmarker} ? phd c: Or {pause} we 'll tell people the frequency of the beep professor b: Encrypt it . phd c: and then they could subtract the beep out . grad d: You can hide it . Yeah . postdoc a: Can't you rely on the archiving to preserve the older version ? phd h: Oh , yeah . grad d: It wouldn't be that hard to hide it . phd e: Right . Exactly . I see . grad f: Yeah , that 's true . Yeah . Yep , that 's true . phd e: See , this is good . I wanted to create some {pause} side conversations in these meetings . postdoc a: OK . professor b: Yeah . You could encrypt it , you know , with a {disfmarker} with a two hundred bit {disfmarker} {vocalsound} thousand bit , uh {disfmarker} grad d: You can use spread spectrum . phd c: Uh - huh . grad d: Hide it . phd e: So {disfmarker} phd c: Here we go . phd e: Yeah . Yeah . grad d: Yeah , there you go . phd e: Cuz we don't have enough asides . phd h: I have an idea . You reverse the signal , grad d: There you go . phd h: so it {disfmarker} it lets people say what they said backwards . grad f: Backwards . grad d: Then you have , like , subliminal , uh , messages , grad f: But , ha you 've seen the {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments . phd h: Yeah . grad d: like . grad f: Did you read that paper ? It wouldn't work . phd h: No . grad f: The speech recognizer still works . phd e: Yeah . And if you do it backward then {disfmarker} professor b: Yeah . phd c: That 's cuz they use forward - backward . phd e: H - good old HMM . grad f: Forward but backward . That 's right . phd e: No , it 's backward - forward . grad f: Good point . A point . Well , I 'm sorry if I sound a little peeved about this whole thing . It 's just we 've had meeting after meeting after meeting a on this and it seems like we 've never gotten it resolved . postdoc a: Hmm . professor b: Well , but we never also {disfmarker} we 've also never done it . phd e: Uh . grad f: So . postdoc a: This is the first cycle . phd e: If it makes {disfmarker} grad f: Yeah . postdoc a: There 're bound to be some glitches the first time through . professor b: So . {vocalsound} And , uh {disfmarker} and I 'm sorry responding without , uh , having much knowledge , but the thing is , uh , I am , like , one of these people who gets a gazillion mails and {disfmarker} and stuff comes in as grad f: Well , and that 's exactly why I did it the way I did it , which is the default is if you do nothing we 're gonna release it . professor b: Yeah . grad f: Because , you know , I have my {pause} stack of emails of to d to be done , that , you know , fifty or sixty long , and the ones at the top I 'm never gonna get to . professor b: Right . grad f: And , uh {pause} So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} phd c: Move them to the bottom . professor b: So {disfmarker} so the only thing we 're missing is {disfmarker} is some way to respond to easily to say , uh , " OK , go ahead " or something . grad f: Yeah , right . So , i this is gonna mean {disfmarker} phd c: Just re - mail them to yourself and then they 're at the bottom . professor b: Yeah . grad f: Yeah . postdoc a: Yeah . grad f: Yeah . That 's actually definitely a good point . The m email doesn't specify that you can just reply to the email , as op as opposed to going to the form postdoc a: Mm - hmm . phd h: In {disfmarker} postdoc a: And it also doesn't give a {disfmarker} a specific {disfmarker} I didn't think of it . phd e: Right . grad f: and {disfmarker} postdoc a: S I think it 's a good idea {disfmarker} an ex explicit time by which this will be considered definite . grad f: Yeah , release . postdoc a: And {disfmarker} and it has to be a time earlier than that endpoint . professor b: Yeah . It 's converging . postdoc a: Yeah . That 's right . phd h: This {disfmarker} um , I 've seen this recently . Uh , I got email , and it {disfmarker} i if I use a MIME - capable mail reader , it actually says , you know , click on this button to confirm receipt {pause} of the {disfmarker} of the mail . postdoc a: Oh , that 's interesting . grad d: Hmm . phd h: So {disfmarker} grad f: You {disfmarker} you can {disfmarker} grad d: It 's like certified mail . grad f: A lot of mailers support return receipt . postdoc a: Could do that . phd h: Right . grad f: But it doesn't confirm that they 've read it . phd h: No , no , no . This is different . This is not {disfmarker} So , I {disfmarker} I know , you can tell , you know , the , uh , mail delivery agent to {disfmarker} to confirm that the mail was delivered to your mailbox . postdoc a: Mmm . grad f: Right . phd h: But {disfmarker} but , no . This was different . Ins - in the mail , there was a {disfmarker} grad f: Oh , just a button . phd h: uh , th there was a button that when you clicked on it , it would send , uh , you know , a actual acknowledgement to the sender that you had actually looked at the mail . grad f: Oh , yeah . Yeah . Unfor - Yeah , we could do that . But I hate that . phd h: But it o but it only works for , you know , MIME - capable {disfmarker} you know , if you use Netscape or something like that for your n grad f: Yeah . professor b: And {disfmarker} phd e: You might as well just respond to the mail . professor b: And we actually need a third thing . phd e: I mean phd h: Right . professor b: It 's not that you 've looked at it , it 's that you 've looked at it and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and agree with one of the possible actions . phd h: No , no . You can do that . professor b: Right ? phd h: You know , you can put this button anywhere you want , professor b: Oh ? Oh , I see . phd h: and you can put it the bottom of the message and say " here , by {disfmarker} you know , by clicking on this , I {disfmarker} I agree {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , you know , I acknowledge {disfmarker} " professor b: That i i my first - born children are yours , and {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah . phd e: Quick question . Are , um {disfmarker} grad f: Well , I could put a URL in there without any difficulty and {pause} even pretty simple MIME readers can do that . So . postdoc a: But why shouldn't they just {pause} email back ? I don't see there 's a problem . professor b: Yeah . grad f: Yeah . Reply . phd h: Right . postdoc a: It 's very nice . I {disfmarker} I like the high - tech aspect of it , professor b: Yeah . postdoc a: but I think {disfmarker} phd h: No , no , no . {vocalsound} I actually don't . postdoc a: I appreciate it . phd h: I 'm just saying that grad f: Well , I {disfmarker} cuz I use a text mail reader . phd h: if ev but I 'm {disfmarker} phd e: Don't you use VI for your mai ? phd h: Yeah . professor b: Wow . That 's {disfmarker} that 's my guy . Alright . grad f: You {disfmarker} you read email {pause} in VI ? phd h: Yeah . postdoc a: Yeah . {vocalsound} I like VI . phd h: So {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} i There 's these logos {pause} that you can put at the bottom of your web page , like " powered by VI " . grad d: Yeah . professor b: Wow . grad d: I see . phd e: Anyway , quick question . grad f: You could put wed bugs in the email . phd e: How m phd h: Yeah . phd e: Like , there were three meetings this time , or so postdoc a: Six . phd e: or how many ? Six ? But , no of different people . So I guess if you 're in both these types of meetings , you 'd have a lot . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} How {disfmarker} I mean , it also depends on how many {disfmarker} Like , if we release {disfmarker} this time it 's a fairly small number of meetings , but what if we release , like , twenty - five meetings to people ? In th grad f: Well , what my s expectation is , is that we 'll send out one of these emails {pause} every time a meeting has been checked and is ready . phd e: I don't know . Oh . Oh , OK . So this time was just the first chunk . OK . grad f: So . Tha - that was my intention . It 's just {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} that we just happened to have a bunch all at once . phd e: Well , that 's a good idea . grad f: I mean , maybe {disfmarker} Is that {pause} the way it 's gonna be , you think , Jane ? postdoc a: I agree with you . It 's {disfmarker} we could do it , uh {disfmarker} I I could {disfmarker} I 'd be happy with either way , batch - wise {disfmarker} What I was thinking {disfmarker} Uh , so this one {disfmarker} That was exactly right , that we had a {disfmarker} uh , uh {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I had wanted to get the entire set of twelve hours ready . Don't have it . But , uh , this was the biggest clump I could do by a time where I thought it was reasonable . professor b: Mm - hmm . postdoc a: People would be able to check it and still have it ready by then . My , um {disfmarker} I was thinking that with the {pause} NSA meetings , I 'd like {disfmarker} there are three of them , and they 're {disfmarker} uh , I {disfmarker} I will have them done by Monday . Uh , unfortunately the time is later and I don't know how that 's gonna work out , but I thought it 'd be good to have that released as a clump , too , because then , {vocalsound} you know , they 're {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they have a {disfmarker} it it 's in a category , it 's not quite so distracting to them , is what I was thinking , and it 's all in one chu But after that , when we 're caught up a bit on this process , then , um , I could imagine sending them out periodically as they become available . phd e: OK . postdoc a: I could do it either way . I mean , it 's a question of how distracting it is to the people who have to do the checking . professor b: We heard anything from IBM ? at all ? phd c: Uh . Let 's see . We {disfmarker} Yeah , right . So we got the transcript back from that one meeting . Everything seemed fine . Adam {pause} had a script that will {pause} put everything back together and there was {disfmarker} Well , there was one small problem but it was a simple thing to fix . And then , um , {vocalsound} we , uh {disfmarker} I sent him a pointer to three more . And so he 's {pause} off and {pause} working on those . grad f: Yeah . Now we haven't actually had anyone go through that meeting , to see whether the transcript is correct and to see how much was missed and all that sort of stuff . postdoc a: That 's on my list . grad f: So at some point we need to do that . phd c: Yeah . postdoc a: Well , that 's on my list . phd c: Yeah . It 's gonna have to go through our regular process . grad f: I mean , the one thing I noticed is it did miss a lot of backchannels . There are a fair number of " yeahs " and " uh - huhs " that {disfmarker} it 's just {disfmarker} that aren't in there . So . postdoc a: Hmm . professor b: But I think {disfmarker} Yeah . Like you said , I mean , that 's {disfmarker} that 's gonna be our standard proc that 's what the transcribers are gonna be spending most of their time doing , I would imagine , postdoc a: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm , mm - hmm . professor b: once {disfmarker} once we {disfmarker} grad f: Yes , absolutely . Yeah . postdoc a: One question about the backchannels . professor b: It 's gonna {disfmarker} postdoc a: Do you suppose that was because they weren't caught by the pre - segmenter ? grad f: Yes , absolutely . Absolutely . postdoc a: Oh , interesting . Oh , interesting . OK . grad f: Yeah . They 're {disfmarker} they 're not in the segmented . postdoc a: OK . grad f: It 's not that the {pause} IBM people didn't do it . postdoc a: OK . grad f: Just they didn't get marked . postdoc a: OK . So maybe when the detector for that gets better or something {disfmarker} I w I {disfmarker} There 's another issue which is this {disfmarker} we 've been , uh , contacted by University of Washington now , of course , to , um {disfmarker} We sent them the transcripts that correspond to those {pause} six meetings and they 're downloading the audio files . So they 'll be doing that . Chuck 's {disfmarker} Chuck 's , uh , put that in . phd c: Mm - hmm . Yeah , I pointed them to the set that Andreas put , uh , on the {vocalsound} web so th if they want to compare directly with his results they can . And , um , then once , uh , th we can also point them at the , um , uh , the original meetings and they can grab those , too , with SCP . phd e: Wait . So you put the reference files {disfmarker} ? phd c: No , no . They d they wanted the audio . phd e: Or the {disfmarker} ? phd c: Jane sent them the , uh , transcripts . phd e: No , I mean of the transcripts . Um . Well , we can talk about it off - line . phd c: Mm - hmm . grad f: There 's another meeting in here , what , at four ? Right ? Yeah , so we have to finish by three forty - five . phd h: D d So , does Washi - does {disfmarker} does UW wanna u do this {disfmarker} wanna use this data for recognition or for something else ? phd c: Uh , for recognition . phd e: I think they 're doing w phd h: Oh . phd e: didn't they want to do language modeling on , you know , recognition - compatible transcripts phd h: Oh . I see . postdoc a: This is to show you , uh , some of the things that turn up during the checking procedure . professor b: Yeah . phd e: or {disfmarker} ? postdoc a: Um @ @ {comment} So , this is from one of the NSA meetings and , uh , i if you 're familiar with the diff format , the arrow to the left is what it was , and the arrow to the right is {pause} what it was changed to . So , um . {vocalsound} And now the first one . " OK . So , then we started a weekly meeting . The last time , uh {disfmarker} " And the transcriber thought " little too much " But , {vocalsound} uh , really , um , it was " we learned too much " , which makes more sense syntactically as well . phd h: And these {disfmarker} the parentheses were f from {disfmarker} postdoc a: Then {disfmarker} Oh , this {disfmarker} that 's the convention for indicating uncertain . grad f: U uncertains . postdoc a: So the transcriber was right . phd h: S postdoc a: You know , she was uncertain about that . phd h: OK . postdoc a: So she 's right to be uncertain . And it 's also a g a good indication of the {disfmarker} of that . phd h: Oh . {comment} OK . postdoc a: The next one . This was about , uh , Claudia and {pause} she 'd been really b busy with stuff , such as waivers . Uh , OK . Um , next one . Um . {vocalsound} This was {pause} an interesting one . So the original was " So that 's not {disfmarker} so Claudia 's not the bad master here " , and then he laughs , but it really " web master " . grad f: Web master . grad d: Oh . {comment} Uh - oh . postdoc a: And then you see another type of uncertainty which is , you know , they just didn't know what to make out of that . So instead of " split upon unknown " , {comment} it 's " split in principle " . grad f: Yep . grad d: Jane , these are from IBM ? grad f: Spit upon ? grad d: The top lines ? postdoc a: No , no . These are {disfmarker} these are our local transcriptions of the NSA meetings . grad f: No , these are {pause} ours . postdoc a: The transcribers {disfmarker} transcriber 's version ver versus the checked version . grad d: Oh . Oh , I see . postdoc a: My {disfmarker} my checked version , after I go through it . grad d: OK . postdoc a: Um , then you get down here . Um . Sometimes some speakers will insert foreign language terms . That 's the next example , the next one . The , uh , version beyond this is {disfmarker} So instead of saying " or " , especially those words , " also " and " oder " and some other ones . Those sneak in . Um , the next one {disfmarker} grad f: That 's cool . phd h: Discourse markers . postdoc a: S phd h: Discourse markers . postdoc a: Sorry , what ? Discourse markers ? Sure . Sure , sure , sure . phd h: Discourse markers . postdoc a: And it 's {disfmarker} and it makes sense phd h: Yeah . Yeah . postdoc a: cuz it 's , like , below this {disfmarker} it 's a little subliminal there . phd h: Yeah . Yeah , yeah . postdoc a: Um . OK , the next one , uh , {vocalsound} this is a term . The problem with terminology . Description with th the transcriber has " X as an advance " . But really it 's " QS in advance " . I mean , I {disfmarker} I 've benefited from some of these , uh , cross - group meetings . OK , then you got , um , {vocalsound} uh , instead of " from something - or - other cards " , {comment} it 's " for multicast " . And instead of " ANN system related " , it 's " end system related " . This was changed to an acronym initially and it should shouldn't have been . And then , you can see here " GPS " was misinterpreted . It 's just totally understanda This is {disfmarker} this is a lot of jargon . Um , and the final one , the transcriber had th " in the core network itself or the exit unknown , not the internet unknown " . And it {disfmarker} it comes through as " in the core network itself of the access provider , not the internet backbone core " . Now this is a lot of {pause} terminology . And they 're generally extremely good , phd h: Mmm . postdoc a: but , you know in this {disfmarker} this area it really does pay to , um {disfmarker} to double check and I 'm hoping that when the checked versions are run through the recognizer that you 'll see s substantial improvements in performance cuz the {disfmarker} you know , there 're a lot of these in there . phd h: Yeah . So how often {disfmarker} ? grad f: Yeah , but I bet {disfmarker} I bet they 're acoustically challenging parts anyway , though . postdoc a: No , actually no . grad d: Mmm . postdoc a: Huh - uh . grad f: Oh , really ? Uh , it 's {disfmarker} Oh , so it 's just jargon . postdoc a: It 's jargon . Yeah . I mean this is {disfmarker} cuz , you know you don't realize in daily life how much you have top - down influences in what you 're hearing . phd h: Well , but {disfmarker} postdoc a: And it 's jar it 's jargon coupled with a foreign accent . phd h: But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} But we don't {disfmarker} I mean , our language model right now doesn't know about these words anyhow . So , professor b: Yeah . phd h: you know , un until you actually {pause} get a decent language model , @ @ {comment} Adam 's right . grad f: It probably won't do any better . phd h: You probably won't notice a difference . But it 's {disfmarker} I mean , it 's definitely good that these are fixed . I mean , {vocalsound} obviously . postdoc a: Well , also from the standpoint of getting people 's approval , professor b: Yeah . postdoc a: cuz if someone sees a page full of uh , um , barely decipherable w you know , sentences , and then is asked to approve of it or not , {vocalsound} it 's , uh , uh {disfmarker} grad f: Did I say that ? professor b: Yeah . postdoc a: OK . professor b: Yeah . That would be a shame if people said " well , I don't approve it because {pause} the {disfmarker} it 's not what I said " . grad f: Well , that 's exactly why I put the extra option in , professor b: Yeah . postdoc a: Exactly . That 's why we discussed that . professor b: Yeah . grad f: is that I was afraid people would say , " let 's censor that because it 's wrong " , professor b: Yeah . grad f: and I don't want them to do that . postdoc a: And then I also {disfmarker} the final thing I have for transcription is that I made a purchase of some other headphones phd h: C postdoc a: because of the problem of low gain in the originals . And {disfmarker} and they very much appro they mu much prefer the new ones , and actually I {disfmarker} I mean , I {disfmarker} I think that there will be fewer things to correct because of the {disfmarker} the choice . We 'd originally chosen , uh , very expensive head headsets grad f: Yeah . Ugh ! postdoc a: but , um , they 're just not as good as these , um , in this {disfmarker} with this respect to this particular task . phd h: Well , return the old ones . grad f: It 's probably impedance matching problems . postdoc a: I don't know exactly , grad f: But {disfmarker} postdoc a: but we chose them because that 's what 's been used here by prominent projects in transcription . professor b: Could be . postdoc a: So it i we had every reason to think they would work . grad f: Mm - hmm . phd h: So you have spare headsets ? postdoc a: Sorry , what ? phd h: You have spare headsets ? grad f: They 're just earphones . They 're not headsets . They 're not microphones . phd e: Right . phd h: No , no . I mean , just earphones ? Um , because I , uh , I could use one on my workstation , just to t because sometimes I have to listen to audio files and I don't have to b go borrow it from someone and {disfmarker} postdoc a: We have actua actually I have {disfmarker} W Well , the thing is , that if we have four people come to work {pause} for a day , I was {disfmarker} I was hanging on to the others for , eh {disfmarker} for spares , phd h: Oh , OK . postdoc a: but I can tell you what I recommend . professor b: No , but you 'd {disfmarker} If you {disfmarker} Yeah , w we should get it . phd h: Sure . No problem . grad f: But if you need it , just get it . phd h: I just {disfmarker} grad f: Come on . phd h: Right . professor b: Yeah . If you need it . phd h: Yeah . professor b: Yeah . postdoc a: It 'd just have to be a s a separate order {disfmarker} an added order . grad d: Yeah , I still {disfmarker} I still need to get a pair , too . professor b: They 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're pretty inexpensive . phd e: Yeah , that {disfmarker} We should order a cou uh , t two or three or four , actually . professor b: Yeah . grad d: I 'm using one of these . Yeah . phd e: We have {disfmarker} phd h: I think I have a pair that I brought from home , but it 's f just for music listening professor b: No . Just {disfmarker} just {disfmarker} just {disfmarker} just buy them . phd e: Sh - Just get the model number phd h: and it 's not {disfmarker} Nnn . Yeah . professor b: Just buy them . phd e: and {disfmarker} Where do you buy these from ? phd h: Yeah . postdoc a: Cambridge SoundWorks , just down the street . phd e: Like {disfmarker} ? You just b go and b postdoc a: Yeah . They always have them in stock . phd e: Oh . professor b: Yeah . phd e: That 'd be a good idea . phd h: Anyway . professor b: Yeah . grad f: W uh , could you email out the brand ? postdoc a: Oh , sure . Yeah . OK . grad f: Cuz I think {disfmarker} sounds like people are interested . grad d: Yeah . professor b: Yeah . grad d: Definitely . grad f: So . postdoc a: It 's made a difference in {disfmarker} in how easy . Yeah . professor b: I realized something I should talk about . So what 's the other thing on the agenda actually ? grad f: Uh , the only one was Don wanted to , uh , talk about disk space yet again . grad d: Yeah . u It 's short . I mean , if you wanna go , we can just throw it in at the end . professor b: No , no . Why don't you {disfmarker} why don't you go ahead since it 's short . grad d: Um , well , uh . grad f: Oh , I thought you meant the disk space . Yeah , we know disk space is short . phd h: The disk space was short . Yeah . That 's what I thought too . phd e: That 's a great ambiguity . professor b: Yeah . phd e: It 's one of these {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's social professor b: It 's {disfmarker} I i i it i phd e: and , uh , discourse level grad d: Yeah . phd e: and {disfmarker} professor b: Yeah , it 's great . Yeah , phd e: Sorry . professor b: double {disfmarker} double {disfmarker} grad f: Yeah , it was really goo phd e: See , if I had that little {pause} scratch - pad , I would have made an X there . grad d: Thank you , thank you . grad f: Uh , well , we 'll give you one then . professor b: Yeah . grad d: Um . {vocalsound} So , um , without thinking about it , when I offered up my hard drive last week {disfmarker} grad f: Oh , no . grad d: Um , this is always a suspect phrase . phd e: It was while I was out of town . grad d: But , um , no . I , uh {disfmarker} I realized that we 're going to be doing a lot of experiments , um , {vocalsound} o for this , uh , paper we 're writing , so we 're probably gonna need a lot more {disfmarker} We 're probably gonna need {vocalsound} that disk space that we had on that eighteen gig hard drive . But , um , we also have someone else coming in that 's gonna help us out with some stuff . professor b: We 've just ordered a hundred gigabytes . grad d: So {disfmarker} OK . We just need to {disfmarker} phd e: I think we need , like , another eighteen gig disk {pause} to be safe . professor b: Well , we 're getting three thirty {disfmarker} thirty - sixes . phd e: So . professor b: Right ? grad d: OK . professor b: That are going into the main f file server . phd e: OK . professor b: So . phd c: Markham 's ordering and they should be coming in soon . grad d: W Well . So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} grad f: Soon ? grad d: Yeah . I mean , I guess the thing is is , all I need is to hang it off , like , {vocalsound} the person who 's coming in , Sonali 's , computer . phd h: Oh , so {disfmarker} so , you mean the d the internal {disfmarker} the disks on the machines that we just got ? grad d: Whew . Or we can move them . grad f: No . phd c: These are gonna go onto Abbott . grad f: Ne - new disks . phd h: Or extra disk ? professor b: Onto Abbott , the file server . grad d: So are we gonna move the stuff off of my hard drive onto that when those come in ? grad f: On {disfmarker} phd h: Oh , oh . OK . grad f: Yeah . phd e: Uh , i grad f: Once they come in . Sure . grad d: OK . That 's fine . phd e: Do {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when is this planned for {pause} roughly ? phd c: They should be {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I imagine next week or something . grad d: OK . phd e: OK . So {disfmarker} grad f: If you 're {disfmarker} if you 're desperate , I have some space on my drive . grad d: I think if I 'm {disfmarker} grad f: But I {disfmarker} I vacillate between no space free and {pause} a few gig free . grad d: Yeah . I think I can find something if I 'm desperate phd e: Yeah . grad f: So . grad d: and , um , in the meantime I 'll just hold out . grad f: OK . grad d: That was the only thing I wanted to bring up . phd c: It should be soon . We {disfmarker} we should {disfmarker} grad d: OK . professor b: So there 's another hundred gig . So . grad d: Alright . Great . phd h: Mm - hmm . professor b: OK . It 's great to be able to do it , grad d: That 's it . professor b: just say " oh yeah , a hundred gig , phd e: Good . professor b: no big deal " . grad d: Yeah . grad f: Yeah . A hundred gig here , a hundred gig there . phd e: Well , each meeting is like a gig or something , grad f: It 's eventually real disk space . professor b: Yeah . phd e: so it 's really {disfmarker} professor b: Yeah . Um . Yeah . I was just going to comment that I I 'm going to , uh , be on the phone with Mari tomorrow , late afternoon . grad f: Oh , yeah . professor b: We 're supposed to {vocalsound} get together and talk about , uh , where we are on things . Uh , there 's this meeting coming up , uh , and there 's also an annual report . Now , I never actually {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I was asking about this . I don't really quite understand this . She was re she was referring to it as {disfmarker} I think this actually {pause} didn't just come from her , but this is {pause} what , uh , DARPA had asked for . Um , she 's referring to it as the an annual report for the fiscal year . But of course the fiscal year starts in October , so I don't quite understand w w why we do an annual report that we 're writing in July . phd c: She 's either really late or really early . grad f: Huh . Or she 's getting a good early start . professor b: Uh , I think basically it it 's none of those . It 's that the meeting is in July so they {disfmarker} so DARPA just said do an annual report . So . So . So anyway , I 'll be putting together stuff . I 'll do it , uh , you know , as much as I can without bothering people , just by looking at {disfmarker} at papers and status reports . I mean , the status reports you do are very helpful . phd h: Hmm . professor b: Uh , so I can grab stuff there . And if , uh {disfmarker} if I have some questions I 'll {disfmarker} grad f: When we remember to fill them out . professor b: Yeah . If {pause} people could do it as soon as {disfmarker} as you can , if you haven't done one si recently . Uh . {vocalsound} Uh , but , you know , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sure before {pause} it 's all done , I 'll end up bugging people for {disfmarker} for more clarification about stuff . Um . {vocalsound} But , um , I don't know , I guess {disfmarker} I guess I know pretty much what people have been doing . We have these meetings and {disfmarker} and there 's the status reports . Uh . But , um . Um . Yeah . So that wasn't a long one . Just to tell you that . And if something {vocalsound} hasn't , uh {disfmarker} I 'll be talking to her late tomorrow afternoon , and if something hasn't been in a status report and you think it 's important thing to mention on {vocalsound} this kind of thing , uh , uh , just pop me a one - liner and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll have it in front of me for the phone conversation . phd h: OK . professor b: Uh . I guess , uh , you you 're still pecking away at the {pause} demos and all that , probably . grad f: Yep . And Don is {pause} gonna be helping out with that . professor b: Oh , that 's right . grad f: So . professor b: OK . grad f: Did you wanna talk about that this afternoon ? grad d: Um . grad f: Not here , but later today ? grad d: We should probably talk off - line about when we 're gonna talk off - line . grad f: OK . OK . professor b: OK . Yeah , I might want to get updated about it in about a week cuz , um , I 'm actually gonna have a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a few days off the following week , a after the {disfmarker} after the picnic . So . grad f: Oh , OK . professor b: That 's all I had . grad f: So we were gonna do sort of status of speech transcription {disfmarker} automatic transcription , but we 're kind of running late . So . phd e: How long does it take you to save the data ? grad f: Fifteen minutes . phd e: Yeah . grad f: So . If you wanna do a quick phd e: Yeah . grad f: ten minute {disfmarker} phd e: Guess we should stop , like , twenty of at the latest . professor b: Uh {disfmarker} phd e: We {disfmarker} we have another meeting coming in that they wanna record . professor b: And there 's the digits to do . phd e: So . professor b: So maybe {disfmarker} may maybe {disfmarker} maybe {disfmarker} grad f: Yeah . Well , we can skip the digits . professor b: We could . Fi - five minute report or something . phd e: It 's up to you . I don't {disfmarker} professor b: Yeah , yeah . grad f: Whatever you want . professor b: Well , I would love to hear about it , grad f: What do you have to say ? professor b: especially since {disfmarker} grad f: I 'm interested , so {disfmarker} professor b: Yeah . Well , I 'm gonna be on the phone tomorrow , so this is just a {pause} good example of {pause} the sort of thing I 'd like to {pause} hear about . phd e: Wait . Why is everybody looking at me ? phd c: I don't know . grad f: Sorry . professor b: Cuz he looked at you phd h: What ? professor b: and says you 're sketching . phd e: Uh . I 'm not sure what you were referring to . phd h: I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm not {disfmarker} actually , I 'm not sure what {disfmarker} ? Are we supposed to have done something ? grad f: No . We were just talking before about alternating the subject of the meeting . phd h: Oh . phd e: Uh - huh . grad f: And this week we were gonna try to do {pause} t automatic transcription {pause} status . phd h: Alternating . phd e: I wasn't here last week . Sorry . phd h: Oh ! phd e: Oh . grad f: But we sort of failed . phd h: We did that last week . Right ? phd e: Hhh . grad f: No . professor b: I thought we did . grad f: Did we ? OK . phd h: Yeah . We did . grad f: OK . So now {disfmarker} now we have the schedule . So next week we 'll do automatic transcription status , plus anything that 's real timely . phd h: OK . phd e: Oh . OK . postdoc a: OK . professor b: OK . Whew ! phd c: Good update . grad f: Whew ! professor b: That was {disfmarker} grad f: Dodged that bullet . professor b: Yeah . Nicely done , Liz . postdoc a: A woman of few words . professor b: But {disfmarker} but lots of prosody . OK . {vocalsound} OK . grad f: Th phd h: Uh , I mean , we {disfmarker} we really haven't done anything . grad f: Excuse me ? phd h: Sorry . postdoc a: Well , since last week . phd e: Yeah , we 're {disfmarker} phd h: I mean , the {disfmarker} the next thing on our agenda is to go back and look at the , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the automatic alignments because , uh , I got some {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I learned from Thilo what data we can use as a benchmark to see how well we 're doing on automatic alignments of the background speech {disfmarker} or , of the foreground speech with background speech . grad f: Yeah . phd h: So . phd e: And then , uh , I guess , the new data that Don will start to process {disfmarker} phd h: But , we haven't actually {disfmarker} phd e: the , um {disfmarker} when he can get these {disfmarker} You know , before we were working with these segments that were all synchronous and that caused a lot of problems phd h: Mmm . phd e: because you have timed sp at {disfmarker} on either side . grad f: Oh . Right , right . Mm - hmm . phd e: And so that 's sort of a stage - two of trying the same kinds of alignments with the tighter boundaries with them is really the next step . grad f: Right . postdoc a: I 'll be interested . phd e: We did get our , um {disfmarker} I guess , good news . We got our abstract accepted for this conference , um {disfmarker} workshop , ISCA workshop , in , um , uh , New Jersey . And we sent in a very poor abstract , but they {disfmarker} very poor , very quick . Um , but we 're hoping to have a paper for that as well , which should be an interesting {disfmarker} grad f: When 's it due ? phd e: The t paper isn't due until August . The abstracts were already due . So it 's that kind of workshop . grad f: Mm - hmm . phd e: But , I mean , the good news is that that will have sort of the European experts in prosody {disfmarker} sort of a different crowd , and I think we 're the only people working on prosody in meetings so far , so that should be interesting . postdoc a: What 's the name of the meeting ? phd e: Uh , it 's ISCA Workshop on Prosody in Speech Recognition and Understanding , or something like that {disfmarker} phd h: It 's called Prosody to {disfmarker} grad f: Mm - hmm . postdoc a: Good . phd e: some generic {disfmarker} Uh , so it 's focused on using prosody in automatic systems and there 's a {disfmarker} um , a web page for it . professor b: Y you going to , uh , Eurospeech ? Yeah . grad f: I don't have a paper phd h: Yeah . grad f: but I 'd kinda like to go , if I could . Is that alright ? professor b: We 'll discuss it . grad f: OK . {vocalsound} I guess that 's " no " . professor b: My {disfmarker} my {disfmarker} my car {disfmarker} my car needs a good wash , by the way . grad f: OK . Well , that th Hey , if that 's what it takes , that 's fine with me . professor b: Um . grad f: I 'll pick up your dry - cleaning , too . Should we do digits ? professor b: Yeah . grad f: Uh . phd h: Can I go next ? Because I have to leave , actually . grad f: Yep . Go for it . Hmm ! Thanks . Thank you . professor b: So you get to be the one who has all the paper rustling . Right ?
